In directional and horizontal drilling, hole cleaning is a common and costly problem. Ineffective removal of cuttings can result in several problems, such as bit wear, slow drilling rate, increased ECD (which can lead to formation fracturing), high torque, drag, and pipe stuck3. If this type of situation is not handled properly, the problem can escalate to side tracking or loss of well. Efficient cuttings transport and hole cleaning is very important to obtain an effective drilling operation. In inclined and horizontal drilling, hole cleaning issues is a common and complex problem. This study explores the impact of various drilling parameters, and how they affect the required flow velocity and flow rate required for effective cuttings transport. The study employs three models developed by an empirical approach, Rudi-Shindu?s model, Hopkin?s, and Tobenna?s model. Hopkin?s and Tobenna?s models are more simple than Rudi-Shindu?s. Rudi-Shindu?s model needs iteration in the calculation. First, those models are compared using sensitivity analysis of drilling parameters affecting cutting transport. Later on, those models are employed to determine minimum flow velocity in a horizontal well and an inclined well so we can obtain the advantages and disadvantages of each model. The result shows that those models have a similar trend but a different value of minimum flow velocity. Analysis is conducted to examine the feasibility of using Rudi-Shindu?s models, Hopkin?s, and Tobenna?s models. The result showed that Hopkin?s model is limited by cutting size and RPM. Minimum flow rate from Tobenna?s model is affected only by well inclination, mud weight and mud rheology. Meanwhile Rudi-Shindu?s model is limited by inclination above 45o. The study showed that those models are not suitable for horizontal well, because those models did not provide the effect of lateral section. In addition, sensitivity study was performed to find the effect of each drilling parameters from those models. It was found that the effect of the drilling parameters is similar, except for ROP, RPM, hole diameter and plastic viscosity.", "Daftar File": {"2012 TA PP BRIAN CHRISTIANTORO 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/128296"}, "Penulis": "BRIAN CHRISTIANTORO (NIM : 12208063)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr-Ing.
