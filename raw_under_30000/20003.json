{"Nomor": 20003, "Judul": "HORIZONTAL WELL LENGTH OPTIMIZATION  USING APPLICATION OF GENETIC ALGORITHM MODEL  FOR X GAS FIELD", "Abstrak": "Generally, trial and error approach is applied in reservoir simulation to collect some amount of data that will be compared in finding the optimal solution of the   \n \n\ndevelopment scenario. In this study, genetic algorithm as a directed random search techniques is applied to select the optimum development scenario for X gas field   \n \n\nproduction. One important parameter to be optimized in a gas field is the plateau time production. X gas field will be developed using one horizontal well. GA has   \n \n\na role to replace trial and error procedure in finding the best horizontal well length to obtain the optimal plateau time production in X gas field.   \n \n\nThe objective function for GA is derived using curve fitting function of the plateau time towards the horizontal well length obtained from some trial cases run in the reservoir simulator. GA also will be executed for the different objective function formulated from smaller amount of simulation data. Smaller amount of   \n \n\ndata represent less reservoir simulation cases run in forecasting future reservoir performance.   \n \n\nIt may be concluded at the end of this study that GA, with the appropriate objective function, can give conformable result compared with validation result   \n \n\nusing reservoir simulator. Moreover, the role of GA in reservoir simulation with derivation of the objective function from smaller amount of data still can obtain   \n \n\naccepted accuracy in finding the optimal solution for field production optimization. This would reduce sufficient amount of time in running reservoir   \n \n\nsimulation works.", "Daftar File": {"2010 TS PP DECI ZULVI AMELIA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/101891", "2010 TS PP DECI ZULVI AMELIA 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/101892", "2010 TS PP DECI ZULVI AMELIA 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/101893", "2010 TS PP DECI ZULVI AMELIA 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/101894", "2010 TS PP DECI ZULVI AMELIA 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/101895", "2010 TS PP DECI ZULVI AMELIA 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/101896", "2010 TS PP DECI ZULVI AMELIA 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/101897"}, "Penulis": "DECI ZULVI AMELIA  (NIM : 22208319)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Tutuka Ariadji"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "production optimization, genetic algorithm, horizontal section length,  plateau time production", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
