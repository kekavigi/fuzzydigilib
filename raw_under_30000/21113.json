{"Nomor": 21113, "Judul": "CORRELATION BETWEEN LOW CONCENTRATION TOTAL SUSPENDED SOLIDS AND ACOUSTIC INTENSITIES FROM 1.0MHz ACOUSTIC DOPPLER CURRENT PROFILER", "Abstrak": "This study is intended to evaluate the correlation between acoustic intensity from 1.0MHz Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) and the concentration of total suspended solids (TSS) in the range of 1 to 115 mg/L. \n\nTwo variables (TSS and acoustic intensities) were obtained from the field observation. This observation covered acoustic intensities measurement using 1.0MHz ADCP and TSS measurement at 40% depth above seabed using water sampler. Obtained TSS concentrations up to 115 mg/L over spring and neap tide periods were covered at the study area. Calibration was performed between the acoustic intensities against measured TSS, an equation was developed. This equation was applied to estimate TSS concentration at water column around the interest area. \n\nThe result is a statistical description from the equation. Based on the evaluation, this equation is not applicable to estimate TSS concentration in corresponding area. Correlation coefficient and determination are only 0.49 and 24% respectively, these indicate a positive moderate correlation between echo intensities and TSS concentrations measured in this area.", "Daftar File": {"2015 TA PP ANINDYASTY ROFIQOH 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/109123"}, "Penulis": "ANINDYASTY ROFIQOH", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr.rer.nat.
