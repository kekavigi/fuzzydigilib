{"Nomor": 22997, "Judul": "A STUDY TO DEVELOP PREDICTIVE MODEL OF DEWATERING TIME OF COALBED METHANE (CBM) PRODUCTION FOR HORIZONTAL WELL", "Abstrak": "In the production process of CBM, reservoir pressure must be lowered by produce reservoir water prior to going on methane gas desorption process. This process is called dewatering. The duration of dewatering process depends on the physical parameters of the reservoir and production parameters. Dewatering time is an important parameter because it affects the efficiency and economy level of the development of CBM reservoirs. Therefore, reservoir simulation must be conducted to calculate dewatering time in order to optimize CBM development. However, reservoir simulation for thousands of secenario will take a long time. \n\nThis study focuses on analysis of the relationship between dewatering time and reservoir & production parameters on horizontal production wells from CBM reservoirs, using reservoir simulation software. In addition, to cope with mentioned problem, this paper also provides a predictive model to calculate dewatering time, which comes from sensitivity studies. At the end, predictive models will be validated by the calculation of simulator.", "Daftar File": {"2013 TA PP M. A. TRISNADI 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/116925"}, "Penulis": "M.
