{"Nomor": 21727, "Judul": "EVALUATION OF NON PRODUCTIVE TIME DRILLING FOR X FIELD X-04 GEOTHERMAL WELL", "Abstrak": "Cost overruns can easily manifest during well construction due to unexpected drilling problem issues including lost returns, differential sticking, and narrow pore pressure/fracture gradients. Too often the best drilling practices used to address trouble zones are limited to a few conventional methods with a narrow range of effectiveness.  \n \n\nIn that purpose, the asset management drilling tools and techniques introduced in this study can be effectively deployed in the analysis of drilling performance, they help to detect new opportunities, quantify and address removable lost time and analyze the major problems in a structured manner.  \n \n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the non-productive time occurred during drilling in a geothermal well and to know what the biggest part of non-productive time activities occurred are so the non-productive time activities can be reduced and avoided later.", "Daftar File": {"2011 TA PP DIAN MAULI PUTRA SIMATUPANG 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/111747"}, "Penulis": "DIAN MAULI PUTRA SIMATUPANG (NIM : 12207035)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr.-Ing.
