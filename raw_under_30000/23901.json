{"Nomor": 23901, "Judul": "STIMULATED RESERVOIR VOLUME DETERMINATION ON SHALE GAS RESERVOIR", "Abstrak": "Recent technological advancement allows us to produce natural gas from a very-low permeability formation. Multi-stage hydraulically fractured well is used to produce this resource economically. Stimulated Reservoir Volume (SRV) is a term introduced to assign the part of reservoir around this well and surrounded by undamaged reservoir beyond.  \n \n\nIn this study, SRV and OGIP value of a synthetic field will be estimated using rate transient analysis method. Furthermore, it also shows how to estimate some unknown parameters using regression method and rate transient analysis method.", "Daftar File": {"2017 TA PP RESHA DIRGA 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/120761"}, "Penulis": "RESHA DIRGA (NIM : 12213079)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Prof. Ir.
