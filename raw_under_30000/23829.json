{"Nomor": 23829, "Judul": "THE APPLICATION OF TRACER INJECTION TEST IN VALIDATING THE GEOLOGICAL RESERVOIR MODEL AND INJECTION FLOWING PATH AT FIELD X", "Abstrak": "Tracer injection is one of the latest developed technologies in optimizing the field development in many fields. The interwell tracer injection test is held during the fluid injection, by injecting the tracer fluid after the injected fluid (water, steam, etc.) at the injector well, the concentration of tracer fluid will be recorded at the monitoring wells several days later. According to the concentration data, the reservoir engineers could process it to know some secondary data to determine whether it could validate the geological reservoir model or not, the connectivity between two or more wells and to determine the flowing direction or flowing path of the injected fluid under the reservoir. By the improvement of tracer injection technology, we could improve and eliminate any error in the reservoir modelling. This kind of test has not been widely developed in Indonesia because of its budget needs, but soon will be widely used along with the increasing number of EOR operation in Indonesia.", "Daftar File": {"2017 TA PP RAMOT TIMOTEUS MANURUNG 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/120442"}, "Penulis": "RAMOT TIMOTEUS MANURUNG (NIM : 12213096)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Ir.
