{"Nomor": 22252, "Judul": "PLANNING OF URBAN GREEN SPACES AS EVACUATION AREA IN EARTHQUAKE DISASTER", "Abstrak": "After an earthquake there is a need to evacuate the refugee into evacuation area. Urban green spaces may be suitable for this purpose.The aim of this studies is to assess suitability of urban green spaces as evacuation area. The function of urban green space is not only ecological but also as evacuation area. This study tries to combine it.   \n \n \n\nThe main object of this study is to develop a GIS-based approach to assess the suitability urban green spaces for use as evacuation areas in the event of earthquake disaster. This research used one approach in advance land use suitability analysis the Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MDCA). Multi Criteria Analysis is a tool that create for complex multi criteria problem that add qualitative and/or quantitative aspects of the problem in decision making process. To spatially implement multi criteria analysis it used Spatial Multi Criteria Evaluation (SMCE) module of Integrated Land and Water Information System (ILWIS) and to determine the weight values between criteria, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was adopted.   \n \n \n\nBandung serve as case study because based on earthquake risk assessment from RADIUS project the earthquake may lead to a variety of severe damage that can illustrated with Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale 8 to 9. There is 6 suitability factor used in this study distance from building, distance from road network, capacity of accommodation, slope, earthquake intensity zone and distance from water network. Moreover, from the AHP result the highest weight for suitability factor is distance from building 0.234 followed by earthquake intensity zone 0.231, capacity of accommodation 0.162, slope 0.145, distance from water network 0.134 and distance from road network 0.094.   \n \n \n\nThis research found that SMCE is an effective method for assessing the suitability of urban parks as evacuation area. Urban parks cannot afford all of estimation refugees, only 27 % from the total estimation refugees. It is need additional area for accommodated all of the refugee. Public facilities such as schools, hospitals, and stadiums are generally suitable for use as a shelters.   \n \n \n\nThe location and proportions of urban green spaces is not evenly distributed within the city. There is a need to plan appropriate proportions and distribution of urban parks to make evacuation area can established by relying on existing urban parks.", "Daftar File": {"2015 TS PP GENTRIA ARDIPUTRI PARAMITA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/113920", "2015 TS PP GENTRIA ARDIPUTRI PARAMITA 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/113921", "2015 TS PP GENTRIA ARDIPUTRI PARAMITA 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/113922", "2015 TS PP GENTRIA ARDIPUTRI PARAMITA 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/113923", "2015 TS PP GENTRIA ARDIPUTRI PARAMITA 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/113924", "2015 TS PP GENTRIA ARDIPUTRI PARAMITA 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/113925", "2015 TS PP GENTRIA ARDIPUTRI PARAMITA 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/113926"}, "Penulis": "GENTRIA ARDIPUTRI PARAMITA (ITB: 25413009)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing :   \n \n \n\nDr. Ir.
