{"Nomor": 24666, "Judul": "ADDITIONAL RECOVERY FACTOR DETERMINATION OF SURFACTANT HUFF'N'PUFF METHOD USING ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK (ANN)", "Abstrak": "Surfactant Huff 'n' Puff Method is one of EOR method which can obtain higher oil cumulative production so that we can get higher recovery factor as the main purpose of applying EOR. This method is totally different from surfactant flooding. Surfactant Huff 'n' Puff method is applied by injecting surfactant to the production well instead of injection well. The cycle consists of surfactant injection, shut in production well to wait surfactant soaks, in the other word soaking time, and eventually producing oil cumulative with higher oil rate than the natural depletion one.  \n\nThe advantages of this method are high cost efficiency due to less-complicated surface facilities and no injection well needed. The another benefit of huff 'n' puff method is more effective than surfactant flooding because in surfactant flooding method, the surfactant fluid flows throughout long distance between injection and production well, it will be adsorbed and the only fluid that will reach production well is just water without surfactant. Therefore, huff 'n' puff method is proposed to increase effectiveness and economic value in producing oil.  \n\nWhen the engineers want to know the effectiveness of surfactant huff'n' puff method, they usually perform reservoir simulation to estimate additional recovery factor obtained from surfactant huff 'n' puff method. However, it will take long time and not efficient. This study will generate an artificial intelligence using Artificial Neural Network method that can determine Additional Recovery Factor quicker and has good level of accuracy. ANN method can also know some of the most influential parameters on Additional Recovery Factor. The order of parameters that most influential in determining Additional Recovery Factor are Porosity, Injection Rate, Net Thickness, Oil Saturation, Permeability, Injection Time, Surfactant Concentration, and Soaking Time.", "Daftar File": {"2013 TA PP WAHYUDA NUR HASAN 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/124213"}, "Penulis": "WAHYUDA NUR HASAN (NIM : 12209051)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing :  Dr. Ir.
