EOR method and stimulation methods have been developed to solve the problems. One of the examples is vibroseismic technology. Vibroseismic technology is an alternative method in improving production and increasing recovery since it has been observed that it can reduce capillary force; reduce adhesion between rocks and fluids; separate oil from water; and finally improve pore volume and permeability. \n\nThis paper explains the porosity improvement based on the Brazil Nut Effect, where vibration can break the non-connected porosity and move to the most stable condition in a given time and frequency. The bigger granular is more likely to be on the top part of the rock. Therefore, the sorting is better, resulting in better porosity and better permeability. \n\nThis study employs various laboratory experiments results from the previous studies. Using sandstone reservoir samples, 15 Hz as optimum frequency, and a produced semi-analytical equation for correlating the effect of frequency to porosity improvement. However, the error of the equation is still high. Furthermore, the coefficients being used at the equation have not been explained, for examples what affects the coefficients or what the physical meaning of the coefficients is. \n\nBy employing the Brazil Nut Effect, a new semi-analytical equation is developed to approach the porosity changes due to vibration. The proposed equation has been validated using the experiments data, and the results show much smaller error compared to the previous equation. This paper also explains additional screening factor based on porosity.", "Daftar File": {"2013 TA PP SETIAWAN 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/122440"}, "Penulis": "SETIAWAN (NIM : 12209084)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Ir.
