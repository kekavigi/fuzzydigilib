{"Nomor": 27638, "Judul": "THE HYDRAULIC ANALYSIS OF DUAL GRADIENT DRILLING OPERATION USING LIFTING METHOD", "Abstrak": "The petroleum industry is demanding new drilling concepts that make exploitation of deepwater resources economically feasible. Dual gradient drilling concepts have been introduced to overcome the challenges associated with deep water drilling, by providing simpler, safer, more economic well designs and therefore increasing the ultimate development and utilization of deepwater resources. \n\nIn dual gradient drilling, the wellbore is drilled with two different annulus fluid gradients in place. By having two distinct pressure gradients, a favorable pressure profile in deepwater wells is expected specifically a profile closer to what naturally exists in the formations. As a result, the utilization of dual gradient drilling will reduce the number of casing strings required, reduce the non-productive time and also enhance well control. \n\nOne of the dual gradient drilling technique that named as Liquid and Gas Lift method introduces new fluid circulation system, hence the drilling hydraulic need to be reviewed. In order to review it there are several study that need to be conducted, including the type of drilling fluid and its properties that will be used in deepwater drilling, the effect of high pressure and temperature variation in deepwater environment to the mud density and rheology, cutting transport that need to be ensured so that hole cleaning will not be a problem and the bit hydraulic optimization to ensure that the dual gradient drilling operation will be conducted in an effective manner. This study found that the conventional bit hydraulic approach could not be adapted in this dual gradient drilling system and this study provides the new steps to calculate the hydraulic parameter need to be taken to have an efficient dual gradient drilling operation. This study also found that the u-tube effect will occur during dual gradient drilling operation and provides analysis regarding the u-tube effect. \n\nIn order to solve complex calculation and to have an accurate computation of all parameters required in the hydraulic analysis of dual gradient drilling operation, a software application has been created and developed. This software works by using a proposed hydraulic model from this study and able to compute the distribution of mud and mixture properties over depth, the dual gradient drilling hydraulics, pressure profile and u-tube effect during dual gradient drilling operation.", "Daftar File": {"2012 TA PP HAFIZ ADI KURNIA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/131859"}, "Penulis": "HAFIZ ADI KURNIA (NIM : 12208041)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. -Ing.
