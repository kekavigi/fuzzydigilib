{"Nomor": 20397, "Judul": "REEVALUATION OF MIOCENE-PLIOCENE CARBONATES RESERVOIR POTENTIAL IN THE KUTAI BASIN USING INTEGRATED SEISMIC ANALYSIS", "Abstrak": "Geologically, the study area is situated in the some portion of the Kutei Basin that is bounded to the west by the Kuching High, to the north by the Mangkalihat Ridge and to the east by the Makassar Trough. The basin was dominated by clastic sediments deposited in the environments ranging from fluvial to deep water. However, carbonate buildups are also common in Lower Oligocene to Holocene strata. In general, the carbonates accumulated during trangressions when the locus of clastic deposition shifted landward.             \n \n\nMany studies have been done to understand the carbonate reservoirs characteristic in Kutei Basin which is proven as a hydrocarbon prone area. However, the complexity of facies distribution, structures and pore network resulting from their depositional history and diagenesis process create high degree of reservoir heterogeneity. The studies concluded that carbonates reservoir quality, trap mechanism and sealing rock effectiveness are the key elements need to be assessed carefully.             \n \n\nSeismic inversion and complex attributes analysis were conducted to define carbonate reservoir distribution, quality, potential sealing effectiveness and fluid recognition in the study area. Potential hydrocarbon prospect area was identified with carbonates deposit as the main reservoir and trap mechanism is combination between structural (four way dip closure) and stratigraphic.", "Daftar File": {"2013 TS PP PRAMA ARTA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/104944", "2013 TS PP PRAMA ARTA 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/104945", "2013 TS PP PRAMA ARTA 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/104946", "2013 TS PP PRAMA ARTA 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/104947", "2013 TS PP PRAMA ARTA 1-BAB 4A.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/104948", "2013 TS PP PRAMA ARTA 1-BAB 4B.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/104949", "2013 TS PP PRAMA ARTA 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/104950", "2013 TS PP PRAMA ARTA 1-BAB 6A.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/104951", "2013 TS PP PRAMA ARTA 1-BAB 6B.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/104952", "2013 TS PP PRAMA ARTA 1-BAB 6C.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/104953", "2013 TS PP PRAMA ARTA 1-BAB 6D.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/104954", "2013 TS PP PRAMA ARTA 1-BAB 7A.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/104955", "2013 TS PP PRAMA ARTA 1-BAB 7B.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/104956", "2013 TS PP PRAMA ARTA 1-BAB 8.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/104957", "2013 TS PP PRAMA ARTA 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/104958"}, "Penulis": "PRAMA ARTA (NIM : 22311015)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["#CONTRIBUTOR#"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Geofisika - FTTM", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "The Mangkalihat Ridge, Miocene-Pliocene Carbonates,Seismic Analysis", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "15 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Okt 2017"}
