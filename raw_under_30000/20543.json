{"Nomor": 20543, "Judul": "INTEGRATION OF 4D MICROGRAVITY, GEOLOGY AND PRODUCTION TO EVALUATE WATER INJECTION IN IMPROVED OIL RECOVERY PROJECT, DIAMOND FIELD", "Abstrak": "Water injection is common method applied as reservoir pressure maintenance that recognized as Improved Oil Recovery (IOR) scheme. Reservoir pressure maintenance is required to sustain the oil production and maximize the recovery. Water injection needs to be technically and economically designed, implemented and evaluated properly. When the water injection has been implemented, it is essential to conduct technical evaluation to review the effectiveness in order to achieve the goal and objectives. Understanding the reservoir fluid dynamics including the water injection movement is the key for water injection optimization. Geological, geophysical and production data are to be integrated to portray the reservoir fluid changes. A comprehensive review employing time lapse (4D) microgravity, geology and production is proposed tool for evaluating the water injection in improved oil recovery project. The 4D microgravity that passively monitored through arranged stations has economic advantage compared to the other methods. Several times of time lapse microgravity were recorded in water injection pressure maintenance Diamond oil field. The finding from microgravity anomaly analysis and forward modelling is matched with reservoir production performance to firm the reservoir fluid dynamics. Geology data are significant in reservoir model construction and reservoir quality with regards to fluid flow analysis. The reservoir production takes role in fluid flow, mass balance and fluid phase analysis. It is recommended to increase the water injection through additional water injectors, the locations for new injectors are proposed. With regards to production optimization, potential locations for infill wells are also identified. Considering that water injection optimization and improvement involves surface disciplines such as production operations and project construction, a continuous integration of subsurface and surface discipline needs to be conducted smoothly.", "Daftar File": {"2013 TS PP SRIYANTA HADI 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106038", "2013 TS PP SRIYANTA HADI 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106039", "2013 TS PP SRIYANTA HADI 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106040", "2013 TS PP SRIYANTA HADI 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106041", "2013 TS PP SRIYANTA HADI 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106042", "2013 TS PP SRIYANTA HADI 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106043", "2013 TS PP SRIYANTA HADI 1-BAB 6.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106044", "2013 TS PP SRIYANTA HADI 1-BAB 7.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106045", "2013 TS PP SRIYANTA HADI 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106046"}, "Penulis": "SRIYANTA HADI (NIM : 22311014)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr.Susanti Alawiyah", "Ir.
