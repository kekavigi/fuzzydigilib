{"Nomor": 27158, "Judul": "DESIGN STUDY OF 600 MWt LONG LIFE MODULAR GAS COOLED REACTORS", "Abstrak": "A design of long life 600 MWt Gas-cooled Fast Reactors with three core regions has been studied. The reactors used uranium, nitride, and various plutonium fractions as fuels and can be operated for 26 years without fuel shuffling. Some designs can be operated with relatively excess reactivity whose maximum is 2% dk/k. Using FI-ITB-CHI software, the optimum design has been obtained for fuel fraction 35%, cladding 25% and coolant 40%. The optimum percentages of Plutonium in core region 1, region 2, and region 3 are 40%, 12.5%, and 7%, respectively.", "Daftar File": {"2017 TS PP FAREHA MOHAMED AKAF 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/130720", "2017 TS PP FAREHA MOHAMED AKAF 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/130721", "2017 TS PP FAREHA MOHAMED AKAF 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/130722", "2017 TS PP FAREHA MOHAMED AKAF 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/130723", "2017 TS PP FAREHA MOHAMED AKAF 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/130724", "2017 TS PP FAREHA MOHAMED AKAF 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/130725", "2017 TS PP FAREHA MOHAMED AKAF 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/130726"}, "Penulis": "FAREHA MOHAMED AKAF (NIM : 20215702)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing I : Prof. Dr. Eng.
