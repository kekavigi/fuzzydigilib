{"Nomor": 22986, "Judul": "A STUDY ON VALUE CHAIN ANALYSIS IN FISHERY SECTOR IN BANDUNG, INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "Economic growth and poverty reduction efforts in Indonesia are in fact not followed by the decrease in inequality of income distribution. Coastal communities whose livelihoods as small-medium scale entrepreneurs does not play much in the economic activity. Pro-poor economic development is needed to enable them to participate inclusively in the economic activities. To solve this problem, a study in the fishing industry is essential viewed from value chain perspective. Value Chain Development (VCD) concept can be applied to improve the welfare of fishery communities. \n\nValue Chain Analysis (VCA) is a method used in the implementation of VCD projects. The method contains a workable framework to analyse value chain and is highly compatible to be combined with existing business concepts. Governance are one of the key elements that play a role in the dynamics of relationships among actors and other stakeholders along the value chain. The dynamic illustrates the overall business model of a value chain. Innovation, integration and inter-business collaboration are critical to the long-term sustainability of the business model in order to achieve sustainable economic competitiveness. \n\nA new VCA framework is proposed and tested in a case study to test the adaptability and rigorousness in analysing a Grouper fish distribution chain in Bandung. A semi-structured face-to-face interview was done to extract information and point of view from each value chain participant. Responses were processed and analysed with the help of Computer Assisted Qualitative Data AnalysiS (CAQDAS) technology. Information from each interviewed representatives was compared to generate a higher degree of conclusion and treated as findings for discussion. \n\nIt was found that Business Enabling Environment (BEE) became the main factor affecting process upgrading. BEE is closely tied to regulations, market transactions, infrastructure, and policies which all support to promote innovation. Value chain governance allows TPI to lead innovation of business models to increase value within the system and achieve equitable value distribution. TPI needs to change its business strategy based on shared value perspective so that they can increase income through tax collection and solve social problems simultaneously in a sustainable manner. Important points that can be done by TPI as a recommendation of this research are: (1) changing the business objectives, (2) applying standardization, (3) innovating for continuous improvement, (4) investing in infrastructure, and (5) building a reporting system.", "Daftar File": {"2017 TS PP MARNALA JOSHUA HUTAJULU 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/116904"}, "Penulis": "MARNALA JOSHUA HUTAJULU (NIM: 29114880)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing :  Prof. Togar M.
