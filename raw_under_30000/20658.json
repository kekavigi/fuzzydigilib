{"Nomor": 20658, "Judul": "LABORATORY STUDY OF MATRIX ACIDIZING OF PERMEABILITY-DAMAGED CARBONATE RESERVOIRS", "Abstrak": "Matrix acidizing is a common well stimulation technique in which acid is injected into \n\nthe producing reservoir. The main purpose of the process is to remove wellbore formation \n\ndamage and/or dissolve a portion of the rock and hence, enhance the permeability in the \n\nnear well-bore region. It is however, important to optimize many treatment parameters to \n\nexecute an efficient acidizing job. \n\nThis study are undertaken to investigate the influences of acid injection rate, acid \n\nconcentration, variation of rock permeability, and acid volume injected on the recovery of \n\ndamaged rock permeability using matrix acidizing of oil carbonate reservoirs. \n\nNine core flood experiments are undertaken to investigate the above-mentioned effects \n\non matrix acidizing process using actual cores and reservoir liquids. Every core sample \n\nwas cleansed, evacuated, saturated with brine, flooded with crude oil, and damaged with \n\nbentonite water-base mud. Then, the designed acidizing run was carried out. The rock \n\npermeability was measured before and after acidizing to quantify the success of the \n\nprocess and to identify the effect of every factor. Models of prediction for permeability \n\ndamaged factor and permeability improvement factor were developed. \n\nThe results of the study indicated that the increase of acid concentration and/or the flow \n\nrate increases the recovery of damaged permeability. Furthermore, initial rock \n\npermeability has minor effect on permeability enhancement by matrix acidizing of \n\ndamaged carbonate oil reservoir rocks. The increase of acid injection rate increases the \n\nrequired acid volume injected regardless of the reservoir temperature under acidizing.", "Daftar File": {"2017 TS PP ABDELMAJID AHMED ABDELMOALA 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106952"}, "Penulis": "ABDELMAJID AHMED ABDELMOALA (Student ID: 22215703)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing :  Prof. Dr. Ir.
