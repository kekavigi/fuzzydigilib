{"Nomor": 20771, "Judul": "DESIGN AND ANALYSIS IN IMPLEMENTATION OF NEUTRAL POINT CLAMPED INVERTER USING SPACE VECTOR PULSE WIDTH MODULATION", "Abstrak": "This paper will show you the implementation of  \n \n\nNeutral Point Clamped Inverter in Space Vector PWM  \n \n\ntechnique for three level inverter. The rated components  \n \n\nthat will be used in NPC is presented. The simulation and  \n \n\nhardware implementation has been done for Space Vector  \n \n\nPWM to verified the compatible of NPC in three-level  \n \n\ninverter. Furthermore, the research will be focused in  \n \n\ndetermining rated voltage, power and current of each  \n \n\ncomponent. Also the control circuit that used in this  \n \n\ninverter will be described briefly.", "Daftar File": {"2017 TA PP ADRIAN DEWANTO - ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/107522"}, "Penulis": "ADRIAN DEWANTO (NIM : 18012054)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing :  \n \n\nBurhanuddin Halimi, Ph.D.   \n \n\nDr. Ir.
