{"Nomor": 20983, "Judul": "COMPARATIVE EVALUATION OF MINIMUM MISCIBILITY PRESSURE (MMP) REDUCTION ON CO2 INJECTION BY ADDING ALCOHOL COMPOUNDS AND H2S", "Abstrak": "Abstract  \n \n\nCO2 miscible displacement has been one of the methods used to increase recovery. But, sometimes it is not applicable in many oil fields due to high reservoir temperature because higher pressure is required to reach miscibility. Nevertheless, alcohol compounds and H2S can decrease Interfacial Tension (IFT) between crude oil and CO2 and reduce Minimum Miscibility Pressure (MMP) among them. This investigation considers methanol, ethanol, propanol, iso-propanol, butanol, iso-butanol, pentanol, iso-pentanol and H2S to be simulated and perceive the effect in the MMP produced. The whole simulation would be conducted at different temperature for various paraffinic oil composition and perceive the characteristic each addition of the compounds therewith CO2 injection. This study presents the comparative evaluation of all results that denote there are certain parameters that affect crude oil-CO2 MMP along with alcohol or even H2S. The findings of this research would have been a great consideration of reducing MMP for CO2 injection by using alcohol compounds or H2S.", "Daftar File": {"2017 TA PP ALVINE WINARDI TAMMALA 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/108519"}, "Penulis": "ALVINE WINARDI TAMMALA (NIM : 12213015)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Ir.
