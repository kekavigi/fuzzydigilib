{"Nomor": 23669, "Judul": "DRYING OF BIOMASS WITH HIGH WATER CONTENT", "Abstrak": "This Diploma thesis is focused on the drying of biomass with a high water content. The introductory part gathers theoretical knowledge on this theme. The practical part is divided into two main parts. Firstly there is the description and the evaluation of the drying experiments, which were carried out in the laboratories of CTU. Secondly is the complete design of the rotary steam drum dryer, which is crucial for the drying of fuel, which is a precusor for its combustion in a 1 MW boiler, as given in the assignment. The Design is based on the calculation of fuel consumption in the boiler; drying process analysis and data obtained by experiments. The Conclusion of this thesis is an economical evaluation of the project.", "Daftar File": {"2017 TS PP PAVEL KOVARIK 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/119763"}, "Penulis": "PAVEL KOVARIK", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["SUPERVISOR \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2013 CTU : Ing.
