{"Nomor": 25624, "Judul": "STRAIN CHANGES ANALYSIS DUE TO WATER IMPOUNDING IN JATI GEDE DAM", "Abstrak": "Jati Gede Dam is located around the border of Sumedang-Majalengka region in West Java province. Jati Gede Dam provides several benefits such as for irrigation, hydropower, tourism and fish farming. Dam can also trigger the potential a disaster, especially in the water impounding process. The process of water impounding in the dam has the potential to cause earthquake disaster. The effect of water impounding potentially adds stress accumulation in the dam area so that it can cause earthquakes. Therefore, a research on strain change due to the water impounding in Jati Gede dam is needed. The method used in the research is by GPR survey. Result from GPS observation processed to generate displacement value of GPS observation point, and strain changes from the point that formed grid strain. Based on deformation analysis the effect of water impounding to the strain around Jati Gede Dam can be obtained. Development in this thesis is by using and additional method namely Kinematic PPP to see the different pattern of earth tide phenomenon around the dam which were represented by several GPS station. These results indicate a changes strain for the maximum extension and shortening of 0.405937 and 0.57023 microstrain. From Kinematic PPP method, there are differences between value of power spectrum of model with the result of observation CSUM, JTG1, and JTG2 station, the maximum difference there is in the vertical component of stations CSUM, JTG1 and JTG2 are components M2 and S2. There is a maximum difference between the results of the power spectrum CSUM station in 2011 with 2016 is 0.008516.", "Daftar File": {"2017 TS PP ANING HARYATI1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/126907", "2017 TS PP ANING HARYATI1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/126908", "2017 TS PP ANING HARYATI1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/126909", "2017 TS PP ANING HARYATI1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/126910", "2017 TS PP ANING HARYATI1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/126911", "2017 TS PP ANING HARYATI1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/126912"}, "Penulis": "ANING HARYATI (NIM : 25115014)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing :   \n \n \n\nDr. Ir.
