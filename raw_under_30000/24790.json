Moreover, this research aims to choose sentiment proxies that are eligible for building \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u201ebottom up\u201f sentiment index at Indonesia. Microstructure variables that are related with market efficiency according to Kim & Stoll (2014) are: information (PIN, BSI, and NIT), volatility (VOL and MOM), liquidity (LIQ and STO) and added with market behavior by author (DIS). The null hypothesis of this research, joint abnormal return ) and joint beta coefficient , for each sentiment proxies are statistically not significant against the alternative hypothesis that both variables must be significant. Using Fama-Macbeth 2-stages regression with Hansen-Hodrick and Newey-West correction, it was established that VOL5, VOL60, DIS5, DIS20, and LIQ statistically can reject the null hypothesis significantly. Moreover, this research has sucessfully identified how different stock characteristic (based on market capitalization) reacts towards each microstructure sentiment proxies. At last, the significant variables is selected in forming the first \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u201cbottom up\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u201d sentiment index at Indonesia in next research agenda.", "Daftar File": {"2017 TS PP YOHANNA KARINA 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/124725", "COVER YOHANNA KARINA (Student ID : 29015008)": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246159", "2021 TS PP YOHANA KARINA 1-CHAPTER I.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246160", "2021 TS PP YOHANA KARINA 1-CHAPTER II.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246161", "2021 TS PP YOHANA KARINA 1-CHAPTER III.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246162", "2021 TS PP YOHANA KARINA 1-CHAPTER IV.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246163", "2021 TS PP YOHANA KARINA 1-CHAPTER V.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246164", "2021 TS PP YOHANA KARINA 1-REFERENCE.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246165"}, "Penulis": "YOHANNA KARINA (Student ID : 29015008)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Deddy P.
