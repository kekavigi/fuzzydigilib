{"Nomor": 21476, "Judul": "CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS IN PROJECT MANAGEMENT OF PT DIRGANTARA INDONESIA (INDONESIA AEROSPACE) FOR PROJECTS SUSTAINABILITY (CASE STUDY OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT IN SPIRIT AEROSYSTEM PROGRAM)", "Abstrak": "This research would take a case of project management for Spirit Aero system Program in PT Dirgantara Indonesia (Indonesia Aerospace), located in Bandung, Indonesia. PT. Dirgantara Indonesia(Indonesia Aerospace) company is the only one in Southeast Asia that has core competence in aircraft design and development, aircraft structure manufacturing, aircraft assembly, and aircraft services for civilian or military. One of the business units in PT. Dirgantara Indonesia is the Aero structure Business Unit which are engaged in the design, manufacture of components, and assembly of aircraft framework sub-assemblies. IPT Spirit Aero system program is the manufacture of part-air section, components, equipment and equipment for Airbus type aircraft. In the .program, there are 3 projects in progress. The first project is the inboard Outer Fixed Leading Edge (IOFLE). The project started in 2002 for the manufacture of A380 aircraft parts. Then the next project is Single Aisle Project. Part A320 / A321 are Project Root End Fillet Fairing (REFF). The project started in 2010. \n\nWith a large production capacity, PT Dirgantara Indonesia has delayed delivery of the products. Production delay is a problem that must be solved to minimize by PT Dirgantara Indonesia. Currently, all three projects run simultaneously by applying a work-shift system interchangeably. Balancing the financial and operational work is the main focus to create effectiveness of project in order to achieve the business objective. Thus, to maintain and improve the programs performance, the critical success factors of the project will be helpful in the future. Success factors are components of the project that have to be put in place to ensure the completion of the project. In simple terms, they create an enabling environment for the project to exist in the first place. And for creating said environment, the project\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s manager (Spirit Aero system) should address current issue that happens in the production process first. \n\nDue to future needs for PT Dirgantara Indonesia as a world-class company based on high technology and has a competitive price in the world market, then the company must increase the effectiveness and efficiency of its production line. PT. Dirgantara Indonesia was facing problems due to their lack of technology and inefficiency in the reporting system widely used by the company. The problem affecting their production is delay in delivery due to outsourcing the TSA (coating procedure) to Spirit Aerosystem in Malaysia, and data input problem in the SAP. Both problems are causing major lost for the company. Critical Success Factors will help the company to maintain certain condition in order to create sustainable project for the company. \n\nThis research would take a case of project management for Spirit Aero system Program in PT Dirgantara Indonesia (Indonesia Aerospace), located in Bandung, Indonesia.
