{"Nomor": 29311, "Judul": "INTEGRATED INITIAL WATER SATURATION MODELING", "Abstrak": "Initial water saturation is one of the most important property to calculate the original hydrocarbon in place, yet the value of it is very difficult to determine. Despite there are a few approaches to determine the initial water saturation, those different independent approaches often lead to somewhat different initial water saturation value, which means an error in determining initial water saturation is still common. \n \n\nTo solve that problem, a new method to interpret initial water saturation was presented. By this method, the initial water saturation is determined by integrating data from repeat formation tester, drill stem test, logging, and laboratory measurement. This method is utilizing brook-correy\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s parametrical equation to determine capillary pressure synthetic and Initial water saturation as a function of depth for each rock type. By using brook-correy\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s parametrical equation and integrating those 4 data, this method aims to give a better result than other previous methods. \n \n\nWith the clear step that is presented in this paper, this new method can be applied easily, as long as the data is available. In addition, this method has already tested using real field data, which the result is satisfying and gives a bright spot on the success of it. \n\nIt is concluded that this method is very attractive and has a big potential for further use in determining initial water saturation along with logging and laboratory data. However, a further study is needed to test this method using various field data, with purpose to validate and ensure that this method is reliable for any kind of reservoir.", "Daftar File": {"2018 TA PP MUHAMMAD RAKHA UTOMO 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/135932"}, "Penulis": "MUHAMMAD RAKHA UTOMO (NIM : 12214069)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Dedy Irawan, S.T.,M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "initial water saturation, capillary pressure", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Jul 2018"}
