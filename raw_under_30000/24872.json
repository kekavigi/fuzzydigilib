Several papers had discussed about reservoir properties to model this type of reservoir, unfurtunately the actual production data from the field is not available. Most of the study of liquid-rich systems are about the uniqueness of the fluid and how to produce from the tight formation economically.Similar with other unconventional reservoir for low permeability, in order to produce from this reservoir the well have to be drilled horizontally with multi-fractured completion.    \n \n \n \n\nThis study focused in developing the new Inflow Performance Relationshio (IPR) for liquid rich system under multifractured horizontal well completion. The objectives of this study are to create the reservoir model that represent the liquid rich system, to know the effect of fracture properties along the horizontal section, and to develop the new IPR correlation that coud be used for production performance analysis in order to capture all the phenomena that occurs in liquid rich system.    \n \n \n \n\nThe in-situ fluid of liquid rich system are varied from volatile oils to wet gases. In conventional reservoir, the effect whenthe bottom-hole pressure reach the dew point pressure proven to be significant. While in liquid rich system, proven by the sensitivity analysis for various fracture properties and hydrocarbon compositions, the effect when dew point pressure is reached is insgnificant.    \n \n \n \n\nThe IPR curves were constructed after simulating production performance of liquid rish system reservoir model by compositional reservoir simulator for different cases under variation of fracture properties and hydrocarbon composition with bottom hole pressure ranged from high pressue (near to reservoir pressure) to low pressure (limited by the simulator capability). The resulted dimensionless IPR curves yield straightline for every cases. Therefore, the correlation of IPR can be for any fracture properties and hydrocarbon compositions for liquid rich system under multifractured horizontal well completion.", "Daftar File": {"2014 TS PP ZULMI RAMADHANA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/125122", "2014 TS PP ZULMI RAMADHANA 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/125123", "2014 TS PP ZULMI RAMADHANA 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/125124", "2014 TS PP ZULMI RAMADHANA 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/125125", "2014 TS PP ZULMI RAMADHANA 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/125126", "2014 TS PP ZULMI RAMADHANA 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/125127", "2014 TS PP ZULMI RAMADHANA 1-DAFTAR PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/125128"}, "Penulis": "ZULMI RAMADHANA (NIM : 22212078)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing :Prof. Ir.
