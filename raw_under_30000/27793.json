{"Nomor": 27793, "Judul": "USULAN PERBAIKAN LINTAS PERAKITAN FUSELAGE PESAWAT NC212i PT DIRGANTARA INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "PT Dirgantara Indonesia is a state-owned enterprise (BUMN) which runs aeronautics business. Airplane and helicopter production is the main business of the company. In 2018, NC212i is one of the airplanes with highest demand that is 6 units. However, Head of Component Assembly stated that PT Dirgantara Indonesia is only able to reach NC212i production rate of 4 planes per year. \n\nIn the major sub-assembly production, fuselage part took the longest time which is 3 months. Moreover , problem owner demanded a balanced assembly line. Due to the finding of non-optimum work element allocations, treatment was done by reallocating work element through mathematical model. Adopted mathematical model is integer linear programming. The objective function is to minimize sum of squared deviation. Desired cycle time is used as a constraint. Thereupon, two adjustments were performed onto the model, namely the addition of workstation unit constraint and change in objective function to smoothness index minimization. Computation was performed using LINGO software. \n\nComputation was performed several time based on number of jig with actual cycle time problem, due to unexchangeable inter-jig work elements and to reduce computational workload. Computation resulted in work element allocations into stations. The resulting solution reduced actual cycle time of assembly line from 1010.4 hours to 299 hours. SI was reduced from 3007.77 to 574.65. Workstation was increased from 16 units to 25 units.", "Daftar File": {"2018 TA PP HELMI ABDUL GHANI 1 ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/132238"}, "Penulis": "HELMI ABDUL GHANI NIM 13414111", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
