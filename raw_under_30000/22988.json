{"Nomor": 22988, "Judul": "AUTOMATIZED ANALYSIS OF ADVANCED DRIVER ASSISTANCE SYSTEMS BEHAVIOR", "Abstrak": "This master thesis describes a tool which was created to analyse ADAS. The tool  was created in LabVIEW and Matlab software to ensure high probability of correct  detection and analysis. The software can be used as post processing tool to analyse  records which have been recorded before or for real time detection in a vehicle.", "Daftar File": {"2017 TS PP MARTIN SLAV\u00cdK 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/116907"}, "Penulis": "MARTIN SLAV\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u008dK (23114703)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Advisor : Ing.
