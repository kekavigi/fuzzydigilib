The result is consistent and robust across stocks capitalization and confirm the fact from Indonesia Financial Services Authority data. Individual investors are observed performing anti-momentum trading in big stocks and medium stocks but not in the small stocks while there is no evidence that institutional is momentum trader. Herding behavior on each type of investors is statistically significant and robust across stocks characteristic. Also, there a weak evidence that institutional investors look at what individual investors act in big stocks. Institutional investors will buy(sell) when individual investors sell(buy).
