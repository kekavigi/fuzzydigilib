{"Nomor": 20761, "Judul": "THE MERGER AND ACQUISITION OF THE INDONESIAN STATE-OWNED BANKS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE SINGLE PRESENCE POLICY: A STRATEGIC PROPOSAL", "Abstrak": "The Central Bank of Indonesia established a regulation regarding the ownership of every bank operating in the country. The regulation states that an entity may not be a controlling shareholder in more than one bank. Since this regulation was issued, every bank was required to    \n \n \n \n\nadhere to it, including the state-owned banks namely, Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI), Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI), Bank Mandiri, and Bank Tabungan Negara (BTN).    \n \n \n \n\nThis study will focus on the acquisition and merger alternative of the issue to determine the most profitable solution that may be applied to this matter utilizing methods of valuation, scenario analyses, and synergy. This study will also determine the general strategy of the acquisition or merger, based on core competence, and its internal and external impacts from the perspective of flexibility, risk, income, control, timing, and market power.    \n \n \n \n\nIn this study, 5 scenarios (based on 4 acquisition scenarios and 1 merger scenario) with 2 probable conditions (favorable and unfavorable) are analyzed. Based on the analysis in this study, the values of the individual companies amount to 805 trillion Rupiahs for Bank BNI, 305 trillion Rupiahs for Bank BRI, 322 trillion Rupiahs for Bank Mandiri, and 14 trillion Rupiahs for Bank BTN, with a total combined value of 1,448 trillion Rupiah. Implementing the scenario    \n \n \n \n\nanalyses, the synergies of each scenario shows that the highest is shown through the acquisition scenario establishing Bank BNI as the parent company, with an average value of 1,040 trillion Rupiahs. Based on the analysis of the core competences, Bank Mandiri will be integrated into the Marketing and Sales element of the primary value chain and the Technological Development element of the supporting value chain, Bank BTN will be integrated into the Services element of the primary value chain, and Bank BRI will be integrated into the Services element of the primary value chain and the Infrastructure element of the supporting value chain.    \n \n \n \n\nAfter determining the most profitable scenario, we analyzed the impact of this decision from the perspectives of flexibility, risk, income, control, timing, and market power. Based on flexibility the decision results in the increased flexibility of external funding, based on risk the decision will result in an acceptable risk based on the ability of fulfilling the liabilities of the companies, based on income the decision will result in the increase of EPS of shareholders, based on control the decision will result in a dilution of control of shareholders, based on timing the decision will take place at an appropriate time according to economic conditions, and based on market power the decision will result in an increase of market power of the bank.    \n \n \n \n\nIn the implementation of the decision, Bank BNI will have to prepare for an acquisition proceeding including steps of coordination with stakeholders, due diligence, integration planning, and the preparation of public and private statements. From a regulatory viewpoint, the    \n \n \n \n\ncompany has a potential to be charged against anti-monopoly regulations however based on the analysis the company is not at fault. From a political point of view, the decision will incur potential political friction thus the coordination of the acquisition process will have to be done prudently.", "Daftar File": {"2011 TS PP ADJI TIRTO SAPUTRO 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/107486", "2011 TS PP ADJI TIRTO SAPUTRO 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/107487", "2011 TS PP ADJI TIRTO SAPUTRO 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/107488", "2011 TS PP ADJI TIRTO SAPUTRO 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/107489", "2011 TS PP ADJI TIRTO SAPUTRO 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/107490", "2011 TS PP ADJI TIRTO SAPUTRO 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/107491"}, "Penulis": "ADJI TIRTO SAPUTRO (NIM : 29109059)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Deddy Priatmodjo Koesrindartoto, Ph.D"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Administrasi Bisnis", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "merger, acquisition, synergy, scenario analysis, impacts", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Alice Diniarti", "File": "6 file", "Tanggal Input": "16 Okt 2017"}
