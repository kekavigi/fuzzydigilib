Based on Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change (IPCC), rising sea level reaches 1.75 millimeters annual in Bali Province. It is necessary to identify \n\nbased on based on data from related institutions, visualise through thematic maps using ArcGIS, then analyse the impacts of sea level rise in study area. Based on the \n\nphysical aspect, some beaches in southern coast of Bali has been eroded along coastline such as Sanur, Padang Galak, Kuta, and Serangan beach; Denpasar municipality is the area with the highest level of coastal inundation; ecosystem; shoreline changing in western coast of Badung regency; and saltwater intrusion in Kuta and Denpasar Selatan sub-district. While the socio-economic aspects, there are a decline in area and agricultural production such as rice and maize; decrease in volume and value of production in fisheries and aquaculture (seaweed and shrimp); increase in number of damage streets in Denpasar municipality; Badung regency and Denpasar municipality are the areas with high land value; and population more \n\nvulnerable to sea level rise impacts at Denpasar Selatan and Kuta sub-district due to population density.", "Daftar File": {"2015 TA PP BELLA THESISKA APRILIANTY 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/110293", "2015 TA PP BELLA THESISKA APRILIANTY 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/110294", "2015 TA PP BELLA THESISKA APRILIANTY 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/110295", "2015 TA PP BELLA THESISKA APRILIANTY 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/110296", "2015 TA PP BELLA THESISKA APRILIANTY 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/110297", "2015 TA PP BELLA THESISKA APRILIANTY 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/110298"}, "Penulis": "BELLA THESISKA APRILIANTY (NIM : 15110072)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : \n\nIr.
