Rule based expert system is a computer system that emulates the decision-making ability of a human expert based on rules and facts. Low-cost simple reactivation methods are consists of Cyclic Scheduling and Venting. Those two methods can be categorized as low-cost because those methods just need manpower of operators. \n\nA case study has been done in PM Field to apply the expert system. The result has shown a great improvement of planning efficiency. The base gas production rate was declining before the implementation of the expert system. Then, after the implementation of the expert system, the gas production rate can be maintained. \n\nFinally, it can be concluded that rule based expert system can be used for assisting day-to-day planning in multilayer reservoirs so the gas production in PM field can be maintained.", "Daftar File": {"2018 TA PP AHMAD NIZHOM 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/125938", "2018 TA PP AHMAD NIZHOM 1.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/189935"}, "Penulis": "AHMAD NIZHOM (NIM : 12214009)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing :Prof. Dr. Ir.
