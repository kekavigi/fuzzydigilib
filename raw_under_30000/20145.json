{"Nomor": 20145, "Judul": "SHALE GAS RESERVOIR CHARACTERIZATION USING SIMULTANEOUS INVERSION: CASE STUDY GUMAI SHALE, SOUTH SUMATRA BASIN, INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "The decreasing of fossil fuel reserves in the conventional reservoir has made geologists and geophysicists to explore alternative energy source that could answer energy needs in the future. Therefore the exploration of oil and gas that is still trapped in its source rock like shale is needed, and one of them that is still developed is shale gas. By using Simultaneous Inversion method which directed to Lambda-Mu-Rho attributes, it is expected that the physical parameters of the shale could be assessed. South Sumatra Basin is chosen to be study location in this research because besides there is Gumai Shale formation that contains gas, and also the availability of seismic and well data so the research could be done. It is expected from this research, the study of Gumai Shale related to shale gas development could be done.", "Daftar File": {"2012 TS PP HAGAYUDHA TIMOTIUS 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/103009"}, "Penulis": "HAGAYUDHA TIMOTIUS", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["#CONTRIBUTOR#"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Geofisika - FTTM", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Shale gas, Gumai Shale, South Sumatra Basin, Simultaneous Inversion, Lambda- mu-rho attributes", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Diah Ayu Merdekawati \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Okt 2017"}
