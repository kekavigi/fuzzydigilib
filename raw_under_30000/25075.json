{"Nomor": 25075, "Judul": "KRIGING-BASED AERODYNAMIC SHAPE OPTIMIZATION FOR SUPERSONIC BUSINESS AIRCRAFT", "Abstrak": "This thesis examines the efforts in the implementation of Kriging-based optimization which is developed in flow diagnostic laboratory ITB with three case studies for low fidelity simulation (Euler equations) of supersonic business jet using ANSYS CFX as the solver. The focus of this research is aerodynamic performance optimization using Kriging-Based optimization with Expected Improvement (EI) for single-objective and Expected HyperVolume Improvement (EHVI) for multi-objective. In this research, NASA N+2 Supersonic Aircraft Project was used to be the analyzed object to apply this optimization efforts for supersonic aircraft. With Free-Form Deformation (FFD) as the tool for mesh deformation. This optimization process used 80 design variables focused on the wing of the aircraft in a free stream of Mach 1.6 and angle of attack of 2.1 degree. An unstructured grid, with all geometric details (and a total of approximately 7 million cells) is used. The optimization was done with results of a 3.89% increase in CL, a 2.92% decrease in CD, and a 0.67% increase in L/D as the objectives.", "Daftar File": {"2018 TA PP AFGAN GRADIYANTO  1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/125635"}, "Penulis": "AFGAN GRADIYANTO (nim : 13614033)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Advisors: \n\nDr. Lavi Rizki Zuhal.", "Dr. Pramudita Satria Palar."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Kriging-based optimization, supersonic business jet, expected improvement, NASA N+2, LM 1021", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti \u00a0\n                                     Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2018"}
