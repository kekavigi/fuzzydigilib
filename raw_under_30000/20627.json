{"Nomor": 20627, "Judul": "THE LONG RUN MARGINAL COST ANALYSIS FOR DERIVING ELECTRICITY ENERGY MIX SCENE : CASE STUDY IN SOUTHERN SUMATERA", "Abstrak": "Continuous growth of electricity demand in Indonesia is a major challenge for electric utilities trying to ensure adequate supply. Tendency of coal for supplying  \n \n\nelectricity demand for next decade imposes additional environmental burdens, fossil-fuel reserves are limited while renewable is not yet developed. These circumstances expose the country to mix energy considering lowest cost, security of supply, and environmental protection concerns. To find optimal solution to this triple challenge, this thesis assessed two main models of energy mixes for southern Sumatera system as the case study for the period of between 2009 and 2018. The first is base model which observed base  \n \n\ncase without and with geothermal plant candidate. Second is policy model which examined Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), externality, and natural gas subsidy policies impact to the base model. It is found that the lower cost of generation and environmental emissions are  \n \n\nobtained from the scenario where geothermal power plant is occupied to the base load accompanying coal-fired power plant. In supply security point of view, under  \n \n\nthis scene, coal requirement is 28.75% lower than that on the base case (without geothermal) which can be stored as reserve. This coal reserve will assist Domestic Market Obligation (DMO) of coal policy, as it can be used for supplying existing coal-fired power plants outside southern Sumatera either exported. This scene proposes new build energy mix comprises 55% of coal, 43.5% of geothermal, and 1.5% of natural gas.  \n \n\nFor promoting geothermal candidate, CDM policy can effectively support financing due to geothermal investment uncertainties. Higher geothermal investment, higher CDM affects the share. It is observed that under US$ 2700 - 3000/kW of geothermal investment, on average CDM increase the share by 11.12%. In particular, the results show that externality and natural gas subsidy are not effective to mitigate the challenges.", "Daftar File": {"2010 TS PP YODHA YUDHISTRA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106712", "2010 TS PP YODHA YUDHISTRA 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106713", "2010 TS PP YODHA YUDHISTRA 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106714", "2010 TS PP YODHA YUDHISTRA 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106715", "2010 TS PP YODHA YUDHISTRA 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106716", "2010 TS PP YODHA YUDHISTRA 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106717", "2010 TS PP YODHA YUDHISTRA 1-BAB 6.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106718", "2010 TS PP YODHA YUDHISTRA 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106719"}, "Penulis": "YODHA YUDHISTRA (NIM : 22108020)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["#CONTRIBUTOR#"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Rekayasa Pertambangan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "long run marginal cost, electricity energy mix, southern Sumatera", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "8 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
