{"Nomor": 29171, "Judul": "ANALISIS KEMAMPUAN SPESIES Terminalia catappa, Reutealis trisperma DAN Acacia melanoxylon DALAM HUTAN KOTA HALIM PERDANAKUSUMA, JAKARTA SEBAGAI PEREDAM SUARA", "Abstrak": "In the urban environment, noise is a factor that adversely affects health; however, this is often not realized by the community. The selection of appropriate green plants in urban areas is an alternative to attenuate noise for the sake of human physical and mental health. The objectives of this study were to: (1) determine the lowest average   sound pressure level captured at the point of measurement of three tree species in three different spots in Halim Perdana Kusuma Urban Forest based on absorption and diffraction factors to determine the highest attenuation, and (2) determine potential tree species with good noise attenuation capability to be introduced to the urban forest. Tree species studied were Terminalia catappa, Reutealis trisperma and Acacia melanoxylon. Measurement of attenuation was conducted by emitting a 90 dB sound source at different distance intervals to the receiver. From measurement results, it was found that the lowest average sound pressure level (LAeq) was from Terminalia catappa, i.e., 73.23 dB(A) with excess attenuation of 4.06 dB. Based on attenuation data, the plant species with the highest attenuation based on absorption and diffraction factors is Terminalia catappa. A tree species with potential to be introduced to the urban forest is Viburnum odoratissimum. From the samples gathered, background noise in Halim Perdana Kusuma urban forest have not met the noise level standards stated in Environmental Minister Decree (Kepmen LH) No. 48  of year 1999 for green open spaces.", "Daftar File": {"2018 TA PP Muhammad Diheim Biru 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/135661"}, "Penulis": "MUHAMMAD DIHEIM BIRU - Nim: 11513013", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Devi Nandita Choesin, M.Sc        \n\nDr. Nurudin, S.Hut., M.Si"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sekolah Ilmu dan Teknologi Hayati", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Ilmu dan Teknologi Hayati", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Akustik, Hutan Kota, Peredaman, Ekologi", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan \u00a0\n                                     Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Mar 2018"}
