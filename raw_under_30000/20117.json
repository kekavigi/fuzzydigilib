Density Functional Theory (DFT) is used with GGA for exchange - correlation functional and Hubbard potential U to consider strong electron correlations in 3d orbitals. The results show that for pure ZnO, wurtzite structure (W-ZnO) and zincblende (ZB-ZnO) have a direct band gap of 0.749 eV and 0.637 eV, whereas the rocksalt structure (RS-ZnO) has an indirect band gap of 0.817 eV . By adding Hubbard correction into calculation, it is found to increase the band gap value and correct Zn 3d state position which is close to experimental results. W-ZnO structure is the most stable of the three, therefore, it is chosen to investigate ZnO: Cu with various doping concentration and oxygen vacancy (VO) as native defect. The calculations show that the presence 6.25% Cu dopant will affect to the emergence of ferromagnetism in the system. If O vacancy is introduced, it will eliminate the magnetic property. By increasing Cu doping concentration, the total magnetization in the system will increase while the band gap of the major spin will reduce. From these results, ZnO:Cu could be a strong candidate for Diluted Magnetic Semiconductor (DMS) material and future spintronics applications.", "Daftar File": {"2014 TA PP FREDDY GIOVANNI SETIAWAN 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/102786", "2014 TA PP FREDDY GIOVANNI SETIAWAN 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/102785", "2014 TA PP FREDDY GIOVANNI SETIAWAN 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/102784", "2014 TA PP FREDDY GIOVANNI SETIAWAN 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/102783", "2014 TA PP FREDDY GIOVANNI SETIAWAN 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/102782", "2014 TA PP FREDDY GIOVANNI SETIAWAN 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/102781", "2014 TA PP FREDDY GIOVANNI SETIAWAN 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/102780"}, "Penulis": "FREDDY GIOVANNI SETIAWAN (NIM : 10210059)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Prof. Yudi Darma"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Density Functional Theory, Diluted Magnetic Semiconductor, Hubbard potential, magnetization, spintronics", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
