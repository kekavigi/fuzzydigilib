{"Nomor": 20035, "Judul": "STUDY OF RTKLIB 2.4.2 PERFORMANCE ON PROCESSING GNSS OBSERVATION DATA ACQUIRED BY COMNAV T300 RECEIVER", "Abstrak": "Accuracy of the position from GNSS positioning partly relies on the processing of GNSS data. Careful handling of GNSS positioning is important to ensure that the obtained position accuracy is adequate to support the application. Understanding the performance of RTKLIB 2.4.2 is important to know its capability to support future GNSS positioning in Indonesia. A controlled experiment of GNSS processing with RTKLIB 2.4.2 is executed to understand its performance. GNSS data are processed with RTKLIB 2.4.2 with various combinations of GNSS, duration of observation, and baseline length, in both PPP and Static positioning mode. Position results from RTKLIB 2.4.2 are compared with positions from Bernese 5.2 to determine the accuracy from processing with RTKLIB 2.4.2.      \n \n \n \n \n \n\nStatic processing with RTKLIB 2.4.2 shows accuracy and precision from millimeters to decimeters, greatly affected mostly by baseline length. It also shows that the solutions are dominated by floating solutions for longer baselines. PPP processing with RTKLIB 2.4.2, in the other hand, relies heavily on data qualities and usage of correction models. It shows accuracy and precision of mostly centimeters horizontally and decimeters vertically.", "Daftar File": {"2016 TA PP DION QAIRAWAN 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/102145", "2016 TA PP DION QAIRAWAN 1-BAB1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/102146", "2016 TA PP DION QAIRAWAN 1-BAB2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/102147", "2016 TA PP DION QAIRAWAN 1-BAB3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/102148", "2016 TA PP DION QAIRAWAN 1-BAB4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/102149", "2016 TA PP DION QAIRAWAN 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/102150"}, "Penulis": "DION QAIRAWAN (15111063)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
