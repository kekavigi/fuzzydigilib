{"Nomor": 24805, "Judul": "MATERIAL CHARACTERIZATION AND NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS OF QUASI-STATIC TENSILE BEHAVIORS FOR ULTRA HIGH STRENGTH STEEL MATERIAL FOR ARMORED FIGHTING VEHICLE (UFV)", "Abstrak": "Ultra High Strength Steel (UHSS) material is currently being used in the armored fighting vehicle (AFV) structures. Due to its application in industries, it is important to know the properties of the UHSS materials. Experimental evaluations were performed using 4 different types of tests: composition test by Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES), metallography by optical microscopy, hardness test by Brinell hardness testing machine and tensile test by universal tensile test machine. The dimension of the testing specimen follows ASTM E8. The experimental results were used to validate the material constitutive model developed in the Finite Element (FE) simulation. The microscopic evaluation of the UHSS material showed that it is dominated by a martensitic structure.    \n \n \n \n\nNumerical simulation was conducted using Johnson-Cook material model which is based on empirical characterization to simulate quasi-static tensile test under room temperature. Johnson-Cook model was used because of its ability to model damage evolution and predict failure in many metallic materials. Numerical simulation using Johnson-Cook damage parameters D1=0.37, D2=-0.123, and D3=-1.2 shows a good agreement with experimental results.", "Daftar File": {"2017 TA PP YOSUA PRAWIRA GUNAWAN 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/124795"}, "Penulis": "YOSUA PRAWIRA GUNAWAN (NIM: 13613022)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing :    \n \n \n \n\nIr.
