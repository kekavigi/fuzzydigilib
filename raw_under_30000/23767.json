{"Nomor": 23767, "Judul": "ECONOMIC REEVALUATION IN INDONESIAN OIL FIELD PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACT: CASE OF NATUNA", "Abstrak": "many petroleum company is still struggling to recover from. The oil price which is yet to recover to its \n\nprevious peak spot has caused many proposed petroleum project to be cancelled and even endangering the \n\ncurrently operating petroleum project. ABC WK which operate under XYZ Company is no exception. A \n\nreevaluation of ABC WK\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s value become a mandatory program to determine whether the intended project \n\nvalue will be achievable or not. The intended goal of this research will be to reevaluate the economic \n\nfeasibility of ABC WK and also create a mitigation strategy to ensure the stability of the project\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s final \n\nvalue. \n\nThis study forecast the future price of both oil and gas using the current trend through the usage of Monte \n\nCarlo Analysis, revenues gained from the petroleum project lifting activity, reevaluation of economic \n\nfeasibility analysis by the method of Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and \n\nsensitivity analysis to determine which parameters in the petroleum activity will be able to affect the \n\nproject\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s value the most. This parameters will then be analyzed to create a mitigation strategy that will be \n\nable to optimize the benefit of every corresponding parties. \n\nThe results of reevaluation calculation in this research is $ 2,718,368,004 with WACC of 8.3%, as opposed \n\nto the expected value of $ 2,695,263,863. This is mainly due to the higher recovery rate of oil and gas price \n\nresulted from Monte Carlo method. Gas become the main factor that will drive the final value of the project \n\ndue to the massive volume of production compared to the oil product. Gas price and gas OPEX become the \n\ntwo main factors that need to be mitigated to ensure the stability of the project\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s value. Gas price fixing and \n\ngas OPEX efficiency become the two mitigation method that is eligible to be applied. Sliding scale split \n\nalso become another alternative that can be pursued by the Government of Indonesia. Due to the fact that \n\nsplit revision is a zero sum game that will bring benefit to only one party, price fixing and OPEX efficiency \n\nbecome a much more recommended mitigation technique to be pursued.", "Daftar File": {"2017 TS PP RADITYA DWI ANUGRAH 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/120170"}, "Penulis": "RADITYA DWI ANUGRAH  (NIM : 29115690)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing Thesis: Anggoro Budi Nugroho SE, MBA"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Administrasi Bisnis", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Reevaluation of economic feasibility of petroleum project, NPV, IRR, Sensitivity Analysis, mitigation strategy, zero sum game.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti \u00a0\n                                     Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Nov 2017"}
