{"Nomor": 28652, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY VALUE ENGINEERING FRAMEWORK IN IT-BASED FIRMS", "Abstrak": "The major problem's research in this report is the need for achieving the desired \n\nbusiness performance by focusing on optimal costs through engineering IT \n\nresources. This is needed in view of the existing methodology does not consider the \n\ncausal relationship between the superior performance and the optimal cost, yet \n\ncurrent approaches have concerned to analyze the relationship between IT resource \n\nand firm performance. Essentially, this study is continuing the previous researchers \n\nconfirming that there has been a positive IT\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s role to bring a business up in \n\nperformance. Nevertheless, this study does the different paradigm of the previous \n\nstudies, namely, it configures its research block diagram in a combination of series \n\nand parallel or hybrid to engineer the resources in accomplishing the IT value. This \n\nconstruction refers to an IT value engineering concept, which recommends a \n\nsystems engineering methodology associated with IT inclusion in an organization \n\nto create a superior performance at optimal costs. \n\nConsequently, to solve the problem, a number of propositions direct the research as \n\nfollows: 1) the procedure for testing the IT value model can be developed to verify \n\nand validate the model, so it is reliable as a basic concept to solve the problem of \n\nthis research; 2) the model structure consists of several subsystems, namely IT \n\nresources, firm capability, firm core competence, and firm performance in a hybrid \n\nconfiguration; 3) the relationship between the subsystems on the structure of the \n\nresulting model can be reorganized in order to facilitate the compliance of the \n\ndesired performance criteria and optimize the cost; 4) it is able to optimize the \n\nITVEF in minimizing costs or maximizing revenues; and 5) the framework should \n\nbe internally and externally stable. For that understanding, the applied research \n\ndesign is using systems engineering through an engineering design process by \n\ndefining the problem, generating alternative solutions, selecting a solution, \n\ndetailing the aim, and validating the model. Additionally, this methodology works \n\ntogether with the meta-analysis approach to help analyze the correlation between \n\nIT resources and performance. Likewise, another tool is the Partial Adjustment \n\nValuation (PAV) theory that helps to be as a valuation method between the desired \n\noutput (input) and the realized output of each subsystem (output). This is running \n\nfor both dynamic and static speeds of adjustment of PAV. Moreover, the eight IT-based firms\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019 data, namely Telkom, Indosat, XL, BTEL, \n\nSmartfren, Mandiri, BRI, and BNI function to examine the model. The experiment \n\nand validation outcomes exhibit that the model has shaped as desired although \n\nseveral anomalies have appeared. Nonetheless, the experiment and further studies \n\nhave already resolved the above propositions where the IT value model procedure \n\nfacilitates to disclose that IT values are real; the IT value model contains four \n\nsubsystems: IT resources, firm capability, firm core competence, and firm \n\nperformance, in which their relationship is in a hybrid configuration; the \n\nrelationship among the subsystems is positively reorganized with considering IT \n\nbusiness ecosystem to realize the desired performance criteria and optimize the \n\ncost; the ITVEF is an optimal framework; and the framework is internally and \n\nexternally stable. \n\nSubsequently, the study results release a hybrid fashion model that is structuring \n\nthe IT resource, the firm capability, the firm core competence, and the firm \n\nperformance in a hybrid configuration to construct an IT value engineering \n\nframework (ITVEF). The framework carries out an engineering process \n\nmethodology, whereas the input is the desired output (y* \n\nt) exemplified by the Cobb- \n\nDouglas production function. In addition, this production function input consists of \n\nregular capital (K), labor expense (L) and IT spending (I) that spread among four \n\nsubsystems above. Meanwhile, the output of the framework is the firm\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s gross \n\noperating revenue (yt). \n\nAdditionally, this research contributes to scientific developments from several \n\nperspectives, namely 1) the IT value assessment has been carried out among the \n\nsubsystems; 2) the research generates a passion in IT value study due to \n\ninterdisciplinary of fields (systems engineering, meta-analysis, and PAV), whereas \n\nit did not happen before in IT value research; 3) a novel approach to capital \n\nallocation by the hybrid configuration, whereas its allocation considers many \n\nsystem\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s variables and indicators; 4) this research also launches a novel term: IT \n\nvalue engineering in studying the IT values; 5) this study resulted in the ITVEF, \n\nwhich is not only to remodel the patterns of the IT value study but also to result in \n\nthe concrete estimation of the IT spending and the firm performance in their units, \n\nand 6) this research has applied two types of speed of adjustment, which is a \n\ncoefficient between the change in real output of a production process and the \n\ndesired output alteration. Nevertheless, there are several weaknesses found in this \n\nresearch, such as revenue separation between the model with IT inclusion and \n\nwithout it; therefore, it needs to do future studies to complete the research.", "Daftar File": {"2018 DS PP LUKMAN ABDURRAHMAN 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/134328"}, "Penulis": "LUKMAN ABDURRAHMAN (NIM : 33213003)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : \n\nProf. Ir.
