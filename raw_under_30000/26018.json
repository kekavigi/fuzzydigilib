{"Nomor": 26018, "Judul": "NEW METHOD FOR GAS WELL DELIQUIFICATION BY CYCLIC VACUUM LIFTING PROCESS", "Abstrak": "Gas well deliquification is a method to lift the accumulated liquid at the bottom hole by decreasing the fluid pressure gradient inside the tubing. The selection of the type of deliquification methods depends on parameters such as formation depth, bottom hole pressure, surface facilities, and economic considerations. Gas lift involves high capital investment. On the other hand, a plunger lift involves low capital cost with an intermittent gas production system. \n\nThe Cyclic Vacuum Lifting Process is a new invention that uses a vacuum tank at the surface to lift the accumulated liquid through slim tube. The system works by lowering the surface pressure to as close to 0 psia as possible repeatedly, thus increasing the pressure difference between the bottom hole and the wellhead. This results in a multiphase flow regime inside the slim tube. This flow regime is created to prevent the occurrence of high hydrostatic pressure which causes back pressure into the formation. \n\nThis method has been successfully proven to lift the accumulated water more than estimated in the laboratory scale. Bigger ID of pipe can lift more accumulated water with more fallback phenomenon. In result, it needs more number of cyclic lifting processes. In contrary, smaller ID of pipe tends to lift less accumulated water. In addition, this method takes cheaper cost than plunger lift and gas lift. Therefore, this method is strongly recommended for gas well deliquification.", "Daftar File": {"2012 TA PP BAGUS SURYA BAHARI 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/127924"}, "Penulis": "BAGUS SURYA BAHARI (NIM :12208098)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Ir.
