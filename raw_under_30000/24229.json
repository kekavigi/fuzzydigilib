{"Nomor": 24229, "Judul": "SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AND ACCESSIBILITY TO PUBLIC HEALTHCARE FACILITIES: A CASE STUDY OF CILEGON, INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "Socioeconomic status (SES) may influence the health status of an individual or the community. The attention given to SES as a predictor of health status keep growing since 1960. Meanwhile, equal physical access to health facilities support individuals and the communities to reach better health status. This research seeks the spatial distribution of socioeconomic groups with respect to SES categorization established by the government of Indonesia. Afterwards, this study aims to understand the current accessibility of public health facilities across SES groups in the city of Cilegon, Indonesia.   \n \n \n\nResearch began with reviewing the literatures on underlying concept related to SES which include the indicators and measurements used by previous studies, as well as how measurement of SES implemented in the case of Indonesia. Descriptive statistics was carried out to analyze the characteristics of SES groups within the city of Cilegon and result shows that not all of variables listed in the available dataset could be a good indicator to determined SES of the population. It is also found that the poorest population are mostly distributed in the outskirts if the city, meanwhile, as the SES gets higher the population tend to live closer to the city center.   \n \n \n\nFurthermore, the conceptualization and component of accessibility also be reviewed in order to select the most suitable analytical methods for this research. Location-based perspective using cumulative opportunities measure was chosen as the method. It is used to identify the availability of public health service for the population and highlight the service coverage of public health facilities. The result shows there is a variation in the level of accessibility occurred across SES groups with the poorest population earned the worst physical access and the non-poor being the most advantaged.   \n \n \n\nAlthough this research conducted with the limited access of data, this research could provide some evidence regarding the implementation of current SES categorization system and the condition of accessibility to public health facilities in the case of Cilegon, Indonesia.", "Daftar File": {"2015 TS PP SASHA ARLAVIANI 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/122220", "2015 TS PP SASHA ARLAVIANI 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/122221", "2015 TS PP SASHA ARLAVIANI 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/122222", "2015 TS PP SASHA ARLAVIANI 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/122223", "2015 TS PP SASHA ARLAVIANI 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/122224", "2015 TS PP SASHA ARLAVIANI 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/122225", "2015 TS PP SASHA ARLAVIANI 1-BAB 6.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/122226", "2015 TS PP SASHA ARLAVIANI 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/122227"}, "Penulis": "SASHA ARLAVIANI (ITB: 25413049) (ITC: s6019609)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Sherif Amer", "Ibnu Syabri, B.Sc., M.Sc., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Perencanaan Wilayah dan Kota", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Arsitektur, Perencanaan dan Pengembangan Kebijakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "socioeconomic status, SES categorization, accessibility, cumulative opportunities, public health facilities, Indonesia", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "8 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Okt 2017"}
