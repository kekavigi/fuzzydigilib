The target efficiency was increasing every year and this vision is believed achievable if every division seriously develops some efforts to improve efficiency. One of workover process that can be optimized is swab test. This job is executed to estimate well productivity and pump sizing. Better swab test process and procedure will potentially improve workover job more efficiently. This study use a structured Lean Sigma methodology to help identifying and solving the problem.  \n \n\nThere are two areas in current swab test process that can be improved in order to get the swab job being more efficient. The first is in initial input process (during recommendation proposal) and the second is in the swab job execution. Three non-value-added activities are identified in current swab test process. The study recommends eliminating those non-value-added activities and revising current swab test process at key areas below:  \n \n\n1. Eliminate swab test in heavy oil field  \n \n\n2. Reduce stable rate run test from average 23 runs into only 6 runs for normal PI well  \n \n\n3. Reduce stable rate test runs from average 28 runs into 2 runs for dry or low PI well  \n \n\n4. Substitute swab dry test method with pressure test method to validate packer seal off and integrity  \n \n\nPilot trial showed the new swab process gives similar swab results compare to old process result. The new process made the execution was faster due to smaller required reservoir fluid recovery and faster packer integrity test. The benefit of new swab process implementation came from additional rig utilization capacity. It will expose another additional 18 WO programs as the result of swab test cycle time efficiency. The total additional revenue from the new swab process is around US$ 7,233,300 per year.", "Daftar File": {"2013 TS PP WANDY HENDRAWAN 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106565", "2013 TS PP WANDY HENDRAWAN 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106564", "2013 TS PP WANDY HENDRAWAN 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106563", "2013 TS PP WANDY HENDRAWAN 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106562", "2013 TS PP WANDY HENDRAWAN 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106566", "2013 TS PP WANDY HENDRAWAN 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106567", "2013 TS PP WANDY HENDRAWAN 1-BAB 6.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106568", "2013 TS PP WANDY HENDRAWAN 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106569"}, "Penulis": "WANDY HENDRAWAN (NIM: 22211320)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Ir.
