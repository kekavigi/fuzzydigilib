{"Nomor": 22671, "Judul": "SCAVENGED PRE-CHAMBER FOR A LIGHT-DUTY TRUCK GAS ENGINE", "Abstrak": "The thesis deals with the 3-D CAD model of the pre-chamber ignition system as well as drawings created in the software PTC Creo for an engine which is able to burn  compressed natural gas. The aim is to create a modular pre-chamber system using mass produced parts. The CAD model is used to create a 3-D CFD model in the software AVL Fire. The parametric design of the model saves a time with creating   \n\neach iteration. The 3-D CFD model shows what happens inside the chamber during the cycle and where is a space for ongoing improvements of the design to increase the efficiency, decrease the fuel consumption and decrease costs.", "Daftar File": {"2017 TS PP JAN ANDRES 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/115730"}, "Penulis": "JAN ANDRES (23114701)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Advisor : Ing.
