{"Nomor": 21299, "Judul": "CASING SEAT SELECTION AND CASING DESIGN FOR X FIELD IDD WELL", "Abstrak": "As the need of oil and gas energy are increasing greatly, exploration of new oil and gas reservoir are done intensively. By the time goes, the exploration moves from land (onshore) to sea (offshore). Now, as both of onshore and offshore resources are decreasing, the exploration is moving toward deeper area in the sea or what we call as deepwater.  \n \n\nAfter the new deepwater field is found, there must be some exploration wells drilled to know the real condition in the subsea. These exploration wells are also very useful to be used as input data, bases of data prediction, and bases in designing production wells for development phase.  \n \n\nThis paper presents a production well designing of XC well in X field, Indonesia. The design covers offset wells pressures and temperature profiles analyzation, proposed well pressures and temperature profiles prediction, casing seat selection using casing seat-landmark software, and casing load design using stress check-landmark software.", "Daftar File": {"2011 TA PP ASTRO LIHARDO ALOYSIUS 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/109859"}, "Penulis": "ASTRO LIHARDO ALOYSIUS (NIM : 12207011)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr-Ing.
