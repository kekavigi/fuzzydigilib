{"Nomor": 28139, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT OF A CONSTANT TEMPERATURE ANEMOMETER FOR MULTIPLE HOTWIRE SYSTEMS", "Abstrak": "This work describes the design, fabrication, and testing of a device that is frequently used in turbulence research, the Constant Temperature Anemometer (CTA) Hotwire System. By exposing a hotwire probe to a flow and measuring the energy needed to maintain a constant temperature along the hotwire, the velocity of fluid at the probe location can be deduced. A single-channel CTA was fabricated and tested on the freestream of a closed-loop windtunnel to determine its applicability in experiments. Furthermore, a comparison between measurement from the built single-channel CTA and a commercial CTA available at the lab (Dantec Dynamics MiniCTA) was investigated. It was concluded that the singlechannel CTA is capable of producing similar result to the commercial CTA with room for improvements. A multi-channel CTA based on the single-channel CTA design was also fabricated. A key feature of this multi-channel CTA, that is currently being tested, is the integrated test circuits to fully optimize the system for turbulence measurement.", "Daftar File": {"2018 TA PP  IRSYAD LUKMAN E 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/133170"}, "Penulis": "IRSYAD LUKMAN E (NIM: 13614058)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Advisors : Dr. Lavi Rizki Zuhal."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Constant Temperature Anemometer, Hotwire, Turbulence, Aerodynamic Experiments", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti \u00a0\n                                     Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Jul 2018"}
