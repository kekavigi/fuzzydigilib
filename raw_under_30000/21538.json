{"Nomor": 21538, "Judul": "INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY IN LANGUAGE STUDIES (ELEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE 2016)", "Abstrak": "This collection of papers represents a selection of those presented at the 11th Biennial Conference on Learning English (BICOLE) at the Institute of Technology Bandung (ITB), in cooperation with the British Council (BC) and the University of Leeds in the UK. This sequence of conferences, one of the longest in any field in Indonesia, has been sustained because of its reputation for quality. All presenters have to meet strict criteria for acceptance, which means that attendees are guaranteed presentations of a high academic standard and practical relevance. These qualities are evident in the contributions in this volume too.             \n\nAnother feature of the conference series is the choice of theme. These are always quite specific and focussed on an issue of real importance to contemporary language education in Indonesia. The theme of the 11th conference was 'Information and Communications Technology in Language Studies', and it is difficult to think of a topic that is more urgent for all educators, in all subject areas, in almost all global contexts, than the march of technology.             \n\nThe writers/presenters come from a range of institutions, secondary and tertiary, state and private, secular and religious, but all share a deep interest in the opportunities that technology offers for language             \n\nlearning and teaching (and especially English, given its widespread use on the internet), while remaining aware of some of the potential pitfalls of technology use, either because the technology itself fails or because it does not actually answer our pedagogical needs.             \n\nThe collection is organized into four sections. The first, E-learning and E-teaching, focuses on pedagogical digital tools, that is, technology designed specifically to support teaching (such as platforms like Edmodo), or applications of mainstream software like email and word processing. The second section is at the more innovative end of the spectrum, in that the papers explore the use of social media apps that were never designed with pedagogy in mind. But as the writers show, social media has immense educational potential, not least because that is where many young Indonesians are exposed to English, or even use it themselves in expressing their online identities. The last three sections look at more specialized uses of technology in language education: teacher education, language assessment and corpus analysis. In all these fields, it is probably safe to say we are on the cusp of a technological revolution which will transform practice on the coming decades.             \n\nI have been fortunate enough to attend five of these conferences myself and I'm aware that their success is dependent on the hard work of the organizers over a period of a year or more. I'd therefore like to  extend my thanks and congratulations to Dr Lusia M. Nurani and her team at ITB, to the British Council Jakarta and to my colleague from Leeds Hywel Coleman for their professional dedication and creativity, which brought together so many English teaching specialists from across the archipelago for three days of intense             \n\ndiscussion, as well as this volume of wise words distilled from the event itself.          \n\nI hope you enjoy reading these papers as much as I enjoyed listening to them during the conference.    \n \n \n\nDr. Martin Lamb              \n\nSenior Lecturer in TESOL             \n\nUniversity of Leeds", "Daftar File": {"2016 JRNL PP LANGUAGE CENTRE  1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/110896", "2016 JRNL PP LANGUAGE CENTRE  1-SECTION 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/110897", "2016 JRNL PP LANGUAGE CENTRE  1-SECTION 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/110898", "2016 JRNL PP LANGUAGE CENTRE  1-SECTION 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/110899", "2016 JRNL PP LANGUAGE CENTRE  1-SECTION 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/110900", "2016 JRNL PP LANGUAGE CENTRE  1-SECTION 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/110901"}, "Penulis": "Contributors : Hywel Coleman", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Preface By Dr. Martin Lamb.
