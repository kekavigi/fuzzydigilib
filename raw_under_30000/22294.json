{"Nomor": 22294, "Judul": "DESIGNING CORPORATE VENTURE CAPITAL STRATEGY FOR SELECTING START-UP COMPANIES PORTFOLIO IN INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "Digital related businesses are growing significantly globally and increase 20% on \n\naverage from 2014 to 2020, which are dominated with new rising start-ups based \n\non Silicon Valley. The financing model implemented by those start-ups is using \n\nVenture Capital (VC) model. There are a lot of numbers of VC in the world \n\nperforming fund rising to invest on new start-ups, big corporate also participate in \n\ninvesting on start-ups through subsidiary company called Corporate Venture \n\nCapital (CVC) that act as a vehicle for managing venture fund from parent \n\ncompany. Since 2014, CVC becoming major lead investors on many venture \n\ntransaction with a big share of venture pie. \n\nVenturing are risky business with high failure rate and big money involved, but \n\nthe higher risk at stake will gives the higher possibilities gain for the company. \n\nVenture capitalist has long used subjective methods to make an investment and \n\nCVC need a new model or method to minimize the risk of being too subjective on \n\ninvestment decision. How can we better predict when innovations will survive or \n\nfail for start-ups and when the right time for CVC to make their investment for \n\nstart-up? This research will develop a model for reducing risk when CVC make \n\ntheir investment decision especially for start-up in Indonesia. \n\nIn this research, initial variables will be determined using literature review and indepth \n\ninterview with the CVC expert. The initial variables will become input for \n\ndeveloping a model and the proposed model will be tested and validated using \n\nagent based model simulation. Output from the agent based model simulation will \n\nbe implemented in the real CVC environment using action research methods. This \n\nresearch will use three types of start-ups as agents in agent based model \n\nsimulation and as the subjects on the action research implementation, the start-ups \n\ntypes are: mobile application start-up, payment solution start-up and digital \n\nadvertising start-up. The result from the action research will confirm or reject the \n\nvalidity of each variable and will be used to iterate and update the initial variable. \n\nBased on literature research and expert in-depth interview, researcher can define \n\nnine parameters that become indicator of success from investment made by CVC \n\nin Indonesia such as: geographic location, market condition, country \n\ncircumstances, investment timing / stages, intellectual capital, start-up \n\nii \n\nmanagement team / founder, cooperation with other VC, nature of product and \n\ncoherence. Those parameters will classify start-up into three categories as low risk \n\nstart-up, medium risk start-up and high risk start-up. CVC should invest in the low \n\nrisk or medium risk start-up to make sure their investment will secure in long run. \n\nBased on the action research, the majorities investments perform by CVC are \n\nmade for start-up at later stage. The investments are targeting the start-up \n\nsearching for pre series A, series A or series B funding, at that stage the start-up \n\nalready pass through the product validation, market validation and business model \n\nvalidation stage. The products from start-up at later stager are mature enough and \n\ncan be scaled for enterprise needs. Start-up also already own their customer based \n\nand having experience in implementing various business models to their \n\ncustomers. In this research researcher develop interaction model based on \n\nliterature research and expert in-depth interview, simulate the model using agent \n\nbased model and finally implement the simulation result in the real business \n\nenvironment using action research method. The results of the simulation \n\ndemonstrate that start-up performance progress is determined by the effectiveness \n\nof interactions between stakeholders. The more effective the interaction, the better \n\nthe start-up performance. The simulation results can also be used as a template for \n\nthe interaction of start-ups with their stakeholders to achieve strong performance \n\nthat provides value for investors. The CVC role for supporting the venture \n\necosystem for start-up is also very important in this research. Investors can use the \n\nmodel in this research as the base of CVC strategy investment for reducing \n\ninvestment risks especially in Indonesia. \n\nThe research is limiting to focus on venture capital financing strategy for defining \n\nvariable and developing model that fit with CVC operation in Indonesia to find \n\nthe successful start-up. Further research is needed if we want to implement the \n\nresult of this research outside Indonesia. Preparing the Indonesian venture and \n\nstart-up ecosystem also could be a potential future research topic.", "Daftar File": {"2017 DS G N SANDHY WIDYASTHANA 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/114084"}, "Penulis": "G.N.
