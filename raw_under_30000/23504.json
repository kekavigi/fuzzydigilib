{"Nomor": 23504, "Judul": "BALAY KAWAYAN: LIME AS CEMENT REPLACEMENT FOR PLASTERED BAMBOO WALL SYSTEM", "Abstrak": "In 2013, Philippines was stuck by two major natural calamity, a 7.2 magnitude earthquake in October and a category 5 super typhoon Haiyan in November. It affected thousands of people and left millions of families homeless. There was an urgent need for fast housing construction in post-disaster rehabilitation programs. An immediate solution was through upgradable housing that can be built initially as transitional shelter and eventually be transformed into permanent shelter. This can be achieved through plastered bamboo wall construction. However, this building construction system relies heavily on cement as plaster. This study explores the potential of replacing cement with lime as an alternative building material for cement plasters in plastered bamboo housing. Three bamboo wall panel specimens namely; no plaster, lime plaster and cement plaster will be subjected to static and dynamic test to assess its performance in monotonic and cyclic load response.", "Daftar File": {"2017 TS PP NI\u00d1O BRYAN CHUANGCO AUMAN 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/118991"}, "Penulis": "NINO BRYAN CHUANGCO AUMAN (NIM : 25215701)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing :   \n\nDr.-Ing.
