However, each  \n \n\ncocoa cultivar might develop different response upon regeneration in in vitro  \n \n\ncondition. Therefore, this study was performed to analyze the expression of  \n \n\nSomatic Embryogenesis Receptor Kinase (TcSERK) and Baby Boom (TcBBM)  \n \n\ngenes which are involved in signaling pathway and transcription factor in cocoa  \n \n\nsomatic embriogenesis, respectively. Somatic embryos were induced on both petal  \n \n\nand staminode explants of cocoa flowers from two different cultivars, namely Sca  \n \n\n6 and I04. RNA samples were isolated from each stage of somatic embryos and  \n \n\nsubjected to the gene expression analysis using RT-PCR and qPCR. The results  \n \n\nshowed that Sca 6 cultivar has higher proliferation rates, but the regeneration  \n \n\nability was lower than that in I04 cultivar. Histological analysis also indicated that  \n \n\nI04 cultivar displays better somatic embryo quality compared with Sca 6 cultivar.  \n \n\nIn addition, gene expression analysis exhibited that TcSERK and TcBBM has  \n \n\ndifferent expression patterns during somatic embryo development. The highest  \n \n\nTcSERK gene expression was obtained at the final stages of embryo regeneration,  \n \n\nwhereas TcBBM expressed highly during early stages of somatic embryo  \n \n\ndevelopment. Selection of explants that have regeneration capabilities such as the  \n \n\npetal part of I04 cultivar, will increase the efficiency of large scale seedling  \n \n\nproduction through somatic embryogenesis.", "Daftar File": {"2017 TS PP SULISTYANI PANCANINGTYAS 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/123119"}, "Penulis": "SULISTYANI PANCANINGTYAS (NIM : 21115007)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing :    \n \n\nDr. Fenny Martha Dwivany.  \n \n\nDr. Ahmad Faizal."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Bioteknologi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Ilmu dan Teknologi Hayati", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "gene expression, histological analysis, TcSERK, TcBBM, Theobroma cacao L., somatic embryogenesis.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
