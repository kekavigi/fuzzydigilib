{"Nomor": 29304, "Judul": "DEFORMATION ANALYSIS OF SINABUNG VOLCANO, NORTH SUMATRA, FROM GPS OBSERVATION IN 2015-2016", "Abstrak": "Sinabung Volcano is located in North Sumatra with 2,460 meters high above sea level. This volcano was originally classified as type B volcano, but then classified as type A volcano because it is re-active on 29 August 2010. In November 2015 Sinabung Volcano experienced intense volcanic eruption until July 2016. Increasing activity of Sinabung Volcano is monitored using GPS observation method. \n\nThis research tries to derive precise coordinate of GPS observation points around Sinabung Volcano, analyze the displacement, and estimate strain in Sinabung Volcano using GPS observation data in 2015 to 2016. GPS data from the observation were processed using GAMIT/GLOBK 10.6 to derive geocentric coordinate, topocentric coordinate, geodetic coordinate, and standard deviation of GPS stations around Sinabung Volcano. Topocentric coordinate are used for calculating displacement based on four periods; in May 27th, 2015 - August 8th, 2015; August 8th, 2015 - October 20th, 2015; October 20th, 2015 - December 14th, 2015; December 14th, 2015 - June 25th, 2016. Displacement value plotted as vector and strain was calculated based on the displacement value. \n\nBased on the results, geocentric coordinate of GPS stations derived from data processing have smaller than or equal to 1.5 cm standard deviation. On August 8th, 2015 - October 20th, 2015 the volcano experienced compression while on October 20th, 2015 - December 14th, 2015 it experiencing extension.", "Daftar File": {"2017 TA PP  MUHAMMAD PANDITO PRATAMA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/135925", "2017 TA PP  MUHAMMAD PANDITO PRATAMA 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/135924", "2017 TA PP  MUHAMMAD PANDITO PRATAMA 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/135923", "2017 TA PP  MUHAMMAD PANDITO PRATAMA 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/135922", "2017 TA PP  MUHAMMAD PANDITO PRATAMA 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/135921", "2017 TA PP  MUHAMMAD PANDITO PRATAMA 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/135920"}, "Penulis": "MUHAMMAD PANDITO PRATAMA  (NIM : 15113035)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing :  \n\nDr. Irwan Meilano, S.T., M.Sc.", "Dr. Estu Kriswati, S.T., M.Sc."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Sinabung Volcano, GPS, displacement, strain", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti \u00a0\n                                     Alice Diniarti", "File": "6 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Okt 2018"}
