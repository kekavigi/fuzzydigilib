{"Nomor": 21106, "Judul": "PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF DUAL SYSTEM REINFORCED CONCRETE BUILDING PROTECTED WITH VISCOUS FLUID DAMPER AGAINST STRONG EARTHQUAKE", "Abstrak": "Indonesia is known for its high seismic activities, especially earthquakes that lead to big disasters. With its huge number of islands, geographically, Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire. Four of fifteen main plate tectonics on the earth surface intersect here, i.e. Eurasian Plate, Philippine Plate, Australian Plate and Pacific Plate. This cause Indonesia often exposed to earthquakes in varying magnitudes which consequently lead to great damages. \n\nOne of the latest innovations in order to against seismic forces and reduce the damage it brings to infrastructures is the control system. A structure installed with these dampers doesn\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019t rely on plastic hinges to dissipate the seismic energy. On the contrary, the dissipation of energy is concentrated on the added dampers so that the damage of the main structure is reduced and the function of the structure can be preserved. \n\nThe focus of this Final Year Project is to evaluate the effectiveness of the passive damper, especially Viscous Fluid Damper installed on a 20 Story Dual System Reinforced Concrete Building. Three types of structural modeling will be used in this final year project i.e. three dimension structural modeling without Viscous Fluid Damper, three dimension structural modeling with Viscous Fluid Damper, and two dimension structural modeling with Viscous Fluid Damper. \n\nUsing Nonlinear Time History Analysis in SAP2000, the performance of the designed building, before and after protected, is evaluated. The analysis results that the performance of the building with the Viscous Fluid Damper is better than the basic model. Furthermore, the performance of the building is getting better and better as the damping ratio of the Viscous Fluid Damper increases.", "Daftar File": {"2013 TA PP ANGKY ARIFIN 1 - COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/109072", "2013 TA PP ANGKY ARIFIN 1 - BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/109073", "2013 TA PP ANGKY ARIFIN 1 - BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/109074", "2013 TA PP ANGKY ARIFIN 1 - BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/109075", "2013 TA PP ANGKY ARIFIN 1 - BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/109076", "2013 TA PP ANGKY ARIFIN 1 - BAB 5 A.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/109077", "2013 TA PP ANGKY ARIFIN 1 - BAB 5 B.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/109078", "2013 TA PP ANGKY ARIFIN 1 - BAB 6.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/109079", "2013 TA PP ANGKY ARIFIN 1 - PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/109080"}, "Penulis": "ANGKY ARIFIN Student (ID: 15009011)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Prof. Ir.
