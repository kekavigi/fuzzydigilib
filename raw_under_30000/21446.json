There are many factors affecting the complexity of the pressure drop calculation, such as fluids properties, pipe configurations, deviation of well, and flow rate of fluids. However, some approachs are involved in order to overcome the complexity of the problem. General Application Package was used to build the model which eliminate artificial boundary conditions in reservoir, well and surface network models, through the creation of integrated models. Most of the optimization problems involving routing opportunities will also contain continuous variables as multiple constrains. Considering that constraints have a non-linear, it will deal with Mixed Integer Non-Linear Optimization Problem (MINLP). This problem will be solved by manual optimization approached and the validaton of GIRO as the platform provided by Resolve, IPM Module.   \n \n \n\nThis paper discusses the application of MINLP Optimization to determine best optimized piping route to minimize pressure drop in flowline in order to minimize the Well Head Pressure (WHP) in surface configuration. The maximum production occurs when the optimization approach can minimize the pressure in the manifold so the WHP can be adjusted to lower pressure to maximize the production from each well in actual condition.   \n \n \n\nAfter 128 simulation by manual optimization approach, and 27 simulation by the validation of GIRO optimization approach, it can be concluded that, for overall minimum well head pressure has value 4023.92 psi. The best route selection for each well based on this scenario are B1 is routed to PB2 manifold, B2 is routed to PB1 manifold, K1 is routed to PD2 manifold, K3 is routed to PD2 manifold, K4 is routed to PB1 manifold, D1 is routed to PD1 manifold, and D3 is routed to PD1 manifold. The optimal scenario which can be applied for Gas Field Surface facilities is doing all of works.", "Daftar File": {"2017 TA PP BINTAN PRADIKA 1A.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/110434", "2017 TA PP BINTAN PRADIKA 1B.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/110435"}, "Penulis": "BINTAN PRADIKA (NIM : 12213068)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Prof. Ir.
