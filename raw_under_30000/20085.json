{"Nomor": 20085, "Judul": "BURNED REGIME DETECTION USING 1953 AERIAL PHOTOGRAPH REPOSITORY FROM THE WESTERN DESERT OF AUSTRALIA", "Abstrak": "Australia's arid mainland has known for years for it's social and cultural phenomenon of the indigenous Australian tribes, the Aborigines, where men focus on gun hunting, while the women focus on hunting wooden or iron digging sticks and burning fires on a regular basis to support their foraging activities. Many researchers suggested that moderate and repeated burning has several positive impacts to the surrounding biotic web and terrestrial biodiversity, while preventing habitat loss at the local scale. Remote Sensing method, such as aerial photography and satellite imagery, are suitable technology that developed to acquire certain data or information in large-scale measurement especially in quantify past and present fire activity at spatial scales useful for a range of fire and vegetation management applications. In this research, un-uniform illuminated 1953 panchromatic aerial image repository were reconstructed to widen the known information obtained using Landsat satellite mission data sets from 1970\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2018s. The geometric reconstruction of the imagery was done using GCP acquired from Panchromatic Landsat 8 data using sand dunes feature. The radiometric reconstruction was done using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization method, to the non-uniform illumination image on each flight path, and stitched into seamless mosaic. The objective of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of methods in Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) feature extraction by using GLCM in very limited spectral information. Multiresultion Segmentation and Fuzzy Nearest Neighboor Classification method shown the preffered result of classification with 85,1% overall accuracy of burned regime, unburned regime, and sand dunes.", "Daftar File": {"2015 TS PP FABIAN SURYA PRAMUDYA 1 - COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/102545", "2015 TS PP FABIAN SURYA PRAMUDYA 1 - BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/102546", "2015 TS PP FABIAN SURYA PRAMUDYA 1 - BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/102547", "2015 TS PP FABIAN SURYA PRAMUDYA 1 - BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/102548", "2015 TS PP FABIAN SURYA PRAMUDYA 1 - BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/102549", "2015 TS PP FABIAN SURYA PRAMUDYA 1 - PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/102550"}, "Penulis": "FABIAN SURYA PRAMUDYA  (NIM : 25114016)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Prof. Ir.
