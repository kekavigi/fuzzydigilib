{"Nomor": 28632, "Judul": "GEANT4-BASED MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS FOR EVALUATING THE PERCENTAGE DEPTH DOSE IN INHOMOGENOUS PHANTOM", "Abstrak": "Dose distribution evaluation is a crucial matter in radiotherapy process, because it will signi\ufb01cantly a\ufb00ect the clinical result. This issue is becoming a bigger problem because human body comprises a variety of tissues and cavities with di\ufb00erent physical properties. In order to investigate the in\ufb02uence of this inhomogeneity material in multilayer phantom, we carried out a simulation by using algorithms based on the Monte Carlo method; its ability to keep track of multiple physical quantities simultaneously makes Monte Carlo modelling a quali\ufb01ed tool. In this present work, GEANT4 (GEometry ANd Tracking) is used to evaluate the integrated doses in Percentage Depth Dose (PDD) curve for a 18 MV photon rays (produced by Varian Clinac 2100) and \ufb01eld size of 1.5 x 1.5, 5 x 5, and 10 x 10 cm2. Finally, by simulating 108 particles, we found out that close attention should be paid concerning the dose calculation involving small area irradiation \ufb01elds, particularly in the presence of low density material. Lung tissues, needs particular attention because the Lateral Electronic Disequilibrium (LED) e\ufb00ect exists. In addition, a further research is also needed to investigate the cause of the appearance of spike e\ufb00ect on rib bone's transfer medium area.", "Daftar File": {"2016 TA PP LIVIA JANICE WIDIAPRADJA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/134274", "2016 TA PP LIVIA JANICE WIDIAPRADJA 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/134273", "2016 TA PP LIVIA JANICE WIDIAPRADJA 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/134272", "2016 TA PP LIVIA JANICE WIDIAPRADJA 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/134271", "2016 TA PP LIVIA JANICE WIDIAPRADJA 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/134270", "2016 TA PP LIVIA JANICE WIDIAPRADJA 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/134269", "2016 TA PP LIVIA JANICE WIDIAPRADJA 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/134268"}, "Penulis": "LIVIA JANICE WIDIAPRADJA (NIM : 10211102)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing :  \n \n\nDr. rer. nat.
