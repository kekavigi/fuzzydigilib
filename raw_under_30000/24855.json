{"Nomor": 24855, "Judul": "THE STEAM LEAKAGE IN THE LABYRINTH SEAL DIPLOMA THESIS", "Abstrak": "This thesis contains basic information about mass flow leakage through labyrinth seal. Two different approaches of predicting mass flow rates were compared. The first approach of mass flow rate prediction is using existing leakage models which are empirical formulas based on experimental data. The second approach is to build CFD modelling in numerical simulation software which have been specified as ANSYS FLUENT 16.0 and decide what is the sufficient mesh quality and find the most suitable turbulent model, in order to correctly compute mass flow rates. The result of this paper is to verify the accuracy of the empirical relationships using CFD calculations.", "Daftar File": {"2017 TS PP ZBYSEK RYVOLA 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/125027"}, "Penulis": "ZBYSEK RYVOLA", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["SUPERVISOR \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2013 CTU : Ing.
