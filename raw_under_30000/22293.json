{"Nomor": 22293, "Judul": "EFFECT OF SILVER ADDITION ON MICROSTRUCTURE AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF EXTRUDED AZ91 MAGNESIUM ALLOY", "Abstrak": "The effect of silver addition on microstructures and mechanical properties of extruded AZ91 magnesium alloy was studied. The microstructure, texture, mechanical properties and the aging behavior of AZ91 and AZQ910 alloys that were extruded at 400\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C with a ram speed of 0.1 mm/s are investigated. The occurrence of dynamic recrystallization, precipitation of \uf062-phase Mg17Al12 particles and the formation of basal texture during extrusion are observed by scanning electron microscope equipped with electron backscattered diffraction pattern analysis.   \n \n \n\nArtificial aging treatment (T5) of as-extruded AZ91 and AZQ910 alloys was done at 160\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C in an oil bath. The mechanical properties in line with microstructure of extrusion-aged alloys are investigated. Improvement of the precipitation behavior, for both extrusion-aged AZ91 and AZQ910 alloys, contributes a beneficial improvement of tensile properties, compressive properties, and hardness properties.   \n \n \n\nThe addition of 0.38 wt. % silver to Mg-9Al-1Zn (wt. %) alloy significantly enhances the age-hardening response. This is associated with large size of lamellar-discontinuous \uf062-phase Mg17Al12 precipitates along grain boundary and great amount of continuous \uf062-phase precipitates inside the grain. The precipitation strengthening is rather weak due to less amount of silver. However, better compressive properties also can be obtained on the AZ91 alloy with the silver addition.", "Daftar File": {"2011 TA PP GLENDA ENZY VYONA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/114076", "2011 TA PP GLENDA ENZY VYONA 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/114077", "2011 TA PP GLENDA ENZY VYONA 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/114078", "2011 TA PP GLENDA ENZY VYONA 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/114079", "2011 TA PP GLENDA ENZY VYONA 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/114080", "2011 TA PP GLENDA ENZY VYONA 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/114081", "2011 TA PP GLENDA ENZY VYONA 1-BAB 6.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/114082", "2011 TA PP GLENDA ENZY VYONA 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/114083"}, "Penulis": "GLENDA ENZY VYONA (NIM : 12506017)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Akhmad Ardian Korda, ST., MT"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Metalurgi", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Extrusion, Silver, AZ91 magnesium alloy, dynamic recrystallization, precipitation strengthening.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "8 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
