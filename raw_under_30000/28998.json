{"Nomor": 28998, "Judul": "WORD-OF-MOUTH INNOVATION DIFFUSION MODEL", "Abstrak": "Diffusion of ideas, innovation and many other forms of interest has not only managed to plague humanity but also confound us due to their spontaneous nature. People around the world has used many means (innovation diffusion, heat diffusion, bass theory, agent-based model) to understand and find the underlying law behind such phenomenon. This thesis strives to understand the general outline through computational simulation, C++ program. The program is designed to generate a seeding and member activation using agent-based model, where random networking and adoption takes place, simulating an actual innovation diffusion in live community. Random network creates connection, relation and the number of ties a member might have which allows the adoption process to propagate within the network, affecting each member by a certain probability.", "Daftar File": {"2018 TA PP MOHAMAD MULKINUGRAHA 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/135261"}, "Penulis": "MOHAMAD MULKINUGRAHA (NIM : 10211047)  [10211047]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr.rer.nat.
