In the worldwide used various techniques for thermal enhanced recovery from reservoirs that contain heavy and extra heavy oil. The traditional techniques for thermal enhanced oil recovery methods, due to of extreme heat loss are not effective for production from heavy oil reservoirs or very deep wells. One way to announce heat to the reservoir in a controlled method is microwave heating. Different experiences showed that the successful production by microwave heating powerfully depends on the initial conditions of the reservoir, such as initial water saturation and water salinity of the reservoir. The principles for these parameters to improve the performance of the method are not well known yet. In this project, different experiments were conducted to study the of effect of water saturation differences in microwave heating for heavy oil. In This study showed by a laboratory experiment to simulate reservoir in a form of saturated sandpack with heavy oil and formation water and nanoferro particles then heated using microwaves.", "Daftar File": {"2018 TS PP HAMAD LAMEIN IBRAHIM OGHNI 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/131893"}, "Penulis": "HAMAD LAMEIN IBRAHIM OGHNI (22216701)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Prof. Dr.Ir.
