All of the relevant information including   \n \n \n\nseismic, sedimentology, stratigraphy, geological structures, rock properties and hydrocarbon resources can be brought into the same workspace. Today, an even more powerful working environment allows seamlessly share the 3D static geological model within the G&G team as well as other groups such as reservoir engineers,   \n \n \n\ndrilling engineers, operation manager and economists. However, the working load and time investment for 3D static geological model usually take longer than originally planned. It seems a 'never ending job'. A 3D static geological model always needs to be updated with new data from the current drilling wells, new production information and new 4D seismic. Sometimes, the model cannot be updated with the latest data such as reprocessed seismic, because of the time line of the drilling program or other project constraints. Even though the project can be updated, the problems tend to reoccur when the new data are available after the review and acceptance of the project. This study propose a just in time update model as soon as the new data are available during the drilling operation. The methodology is based on the standardization of data management, efficient setting of data preparation, geological concept and simple programming to accelerate the repeated work when the new data available for model   \n \n \n\nupdating. Without manual steps, this model has been successfully tested and it requires mostly less than an hour to be updated. It can be re-updated in daily basis   \n \n \n\ndepend on the availability of the new data or new interpretation. It is recommended that the just in time 3D model are used together with the existing 3D static model (the one that usually be locked and rigid for revision) to improve project performance by acting as a warning system for accessing better opportunity and to avoid risk.", "Daftar File": {"2012 TS PP SIMON CHRISTIAN KURNIAWAN 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/122609", "2012 TS PP SIMON CHRISTIAN KURNIAWAN 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/122610", "2012 TS PP SIMON CHRISTIAN KURNIAWAN 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/122611", "2012 TS PP SIMON CHRISTIAN KURNIAWAN 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/122612", "2012 TS PP SIMON CHRISTIAN KURNIAWAN 1-BAB 4A.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/122613", "2012 TS PP SIMON CHRISTIAN KURNIAWAN 1-BAB 4B.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/122614"}, "Penulis": "SIMON CHRISTIAN KURNIAWAN (NIM: 2231 1021)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["#CONTRIBUTOR#"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Geofisika - FTTM", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "3D static geological model", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "6 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Okt 2017"}
