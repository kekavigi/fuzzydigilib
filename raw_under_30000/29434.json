Cirebon, one of Indonesia's provinces, is a coastal region and has been influenced by Chinese culture. Since ancient times, China and Korea had frequent cultural exchanges because of war, invasion, or supporting relations. For that reason, Chinese culture has many similarities with Korean culture. Batik is one of the best-known cultures in Indonesia, that using waxes and canting tool to draw patterns on fabric and it was assigned to UNESCO, and there is batik day in Indonesia. But nowadays, printing is used to make batik fabric. Cirebon batik can be seen influenced by Chinese culture and Chinese patterns are depicted on Batik fabric. Among them banji patterns are often found in Korean traditional patterns. \n\nBanji pattern is also known as swastika pattern and can be found all over the world, including the eastern world and Southeast Asia. Swastika has a negative meaning due to a history of Europe which is Nazism, but most countries have a positive meaning as well-being or existence of good and some are influenced by Buddhism. Swastika appears as different meaning, importance and understanding in each of the countries. Swastika is known as \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2018wan\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019 in China and \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2018man\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019 in Korea. \n\nFrom these similarity cultures in different countries shows a chance to make some fusion cultural products.
