{"Nomor": 23870, "Judul": "INTERSEISMIC COUPLING OFF THE SOUTH OF CENTRAL JAVA BASED ON GPS OBSERVATION IN 2010-2016", "Abstrak": "This research is trying to estimate inter-plate coupling rate south off the coast of Central Java Indonesia which is located in the subduction zone between Indo-Australia Plate and Eurasia Plate. According to seismicity in Java Trench, seismicity along Central Java part shows no large (M>8) earthquake in the last 100 years. Recent big earthquakes were the 1994 M7.8 East Java in the east and 2006 M7.7. Java tsunami earthquake in the west. It is interesting to study whether subduction south of Central Java slipping a-seismically or accumulating earthquake energy. In this research, GPS observation data originated from Indonesia Continuously Operating Reference Station (InaCORS) 2010-2016 in Central Java are used and processed using GAMIT 10.6 to obtain displacement rates. The results show that currently Central Java is moving at direction 103-121 degrees at a rate of 23.7\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u201328.4 mm/yr and experiencing subsidence at a rate of 2-6 mm/yr, except in CBLR and CPKL stations. Central Java motion is may be influenced by post-seismic effect of 2006 M7.8 earthquake in the west part, inter-seismic effect in southeast part and Kendeng fault system in northeast part. Interplate coupling rates are estimated by the geodetic inversion based on the formulation of Okada (1992) as surface displacements relate to position, fault geometry, and its movement in half-space. We use ABIC method proposed by Yabuki and Matsu\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019ura (1992) to estimate hyperparameter that weighs observational and smoothing constraint equations. As result, we propose that there is one significant slip deficit patch in the eastern part of shallow area which accumulating 3.120 x 1019 Nm of energy every year which possibly to generate a magnitude Mw 8.6 in 300 years.", "Daftar File": {"2017 TS PP REFI RIZQI RAMADIAN 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/120586"}, "Penulis": "REFI RIZQI RAMADIAN (NIM : 25116010)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing :   \n \n\nDr. Irwan Meilano, S.T., M.Sc.  \n \n\nDr. N.
