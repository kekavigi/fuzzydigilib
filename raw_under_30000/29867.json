{"Nomor": 29867, "Judul": "SINTESIS VANADIUM OKSIDA SEBAGAI MATERIAL ELEKTRODA (KATODA) PADA BATERAI ION LITIUM", "Abstrak": "Lithium ion batteries are widely used as energy storage devices that can fulfill the storage power \n\nrequirements of electronic devices such as laptops and cellphones. However, the electrode material \n\nused in lithium ion batteries currently has a low electrochemical capacity. Therefore, in this \n\nresearch, vanadium oxide was synthesized as a cathode material in lithium ion batteries. IEVOS and \n\nVOS were synthesized through the solvothermal method at temperature 180 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C for 3 hours followed \n\nby annealing that was varied to temperatures 500 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C, 700 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C, and 800 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C and also annealing time was \n\nvaried for 5, 10, and 25 hours. In the XRD characterization, the VOS diffractogram at 500 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C for 5 \n\nhours and 25 hours tended to form the same peak with the V6O13 diffractogram literature; while the \n\nVOS diffractogram at 700 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C for 5 hours; and 800 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C for 5 hours and 10 hours formed other peaks \n\nthat indicate that other oxide vanadium crystals are formed. The optimum condition in VOS \n\nsynthesis is at a temperature of 500 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C for 5 hours. The results of refinement analysis showed that \n\nVOS tended to have a match with V6O13 with RWP value is 19,51%. TGA characterization showed that \n\nthere was a decrease in IEVOS mass three times as shown on the DTG curve, that was at a \n\ntemperatures between 25 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C - 150 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C indicate a reduction of water mass, then at temperatures \n\nbetween 196 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C - 360 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C indicate a decrease of mass caused by decomposition of organic \n\ncompounds that is oxalic acid and ethanol, and a decrease mass at temperatures between 473 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C - \n\n580 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C that indicate the evaporation of the crystal water mass. In FTIR characterization, on the \n\nspectrum of IEVOS IR that has been synthesized there is an absorption peak at wave number 3195 \n\ncm-1, which indicates that there is an -OH functional group derived from water and ethanol, and in \n\nFTIR results both IEVOS and VOS have absorption peaks at wave number 980 cm-1 which is the \n\nfingerprint area for Vanadium(IV).
