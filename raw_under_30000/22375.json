Three-dimensional (3D) geological static model had been created in order to carry out fault seal analysis study at Teapot Dome oilfield, Wyoming, USA, with the objective of predicting the S2 fault sealing potential on F2WC reservoir and establishing its effectiveness by utilizing well production performance analysis. The RMOTC dataset which consists of extensive geological, geophysical, petrophysical, and production database, was used to perform this study. A standard procedure based on Schlumberger Petrel workflow was applied to develop the reference 3D geological static model. Subsequently, standard juxtaposition analysis and simple SGR algorithm analysis were performed to define the S2 fault sealing potential capacity. The S2 fault has leak point at 2186 ft elevation and has only maximum of 20% of SGR values on the juxtaposed area. Bretan\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s formula translated the SGR value into 32 ft of oil column below leak point, while Yielding\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s formula gave total leakage below the leak point. However, production performance analysis indicated solid isolation between the North and South blocks despite of poor sealing potential capacity based on SGR analysis. The 1980s wells production performance profile gave a strong evidence of the separation between the two. The other geological possibilities which make the S2 fault as an effective seal are fault network configuration, the fault permeability, and the fault development mechanism", "Daftar File": {"2012 TS PP HARI ANGGONO 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/114426"}, "Penulis": "HARI ANGGONO (NIM : 22311012)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["#CONTRIBUTOR#"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Geofisika - FTTM", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "fault seal analysis, Teapot Dome, production time scale", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Okt 2017"}
