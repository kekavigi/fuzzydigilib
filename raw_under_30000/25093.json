{"Nomor": 25093, "Judul": "CFD BASED PREDICTION OF DISCHARGE COEFFICIENT OF SONIC NOZZLE WITH SURFACE ROUGHNESS", "Abstrak": "Due to its simplicity and accuracy, sonic nozzle is widely used in gas flow measurement, gas flow meter calibration standard, and flow control. The nozzle obtains mass flow rate by measuring temperature and pressure in the inlet during choked flow condition and calculate the flow rate using the one-dimensional isentropic flow equation multiplied by a discharge coefficient, which takes into account multiple non-isentropic effects, including viscous effects, which causes the reduction in mass flow.  \n\nProper determination of discharge coefficient is crucial to ensure the accuracy of mass flow measurement by the nozzle. Available analytical solution for the prediction of discharge coefficient assumes that the nozzle wall is hydraulically smooth which causes disagreement with experimental results. In this undergrauate thesis, the discharge coefficient of sonic nozzle is determined using computational fluid dynamics method by taking into account the roughness of the wall. It is found that the result shows better agreement with the experiment data compared to the analytical result.", "Daftar File": {"2018 TA PP AGASTYA BAGASTARA 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/125671"}, "Penulis": "AGASTYA BAGASKARA  (NIM : 13613036) [13613013]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr.Ing.
