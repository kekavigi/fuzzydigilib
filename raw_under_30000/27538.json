YANG DIINTRODUKSI PADA UMBI UBI JALAR (Ipomoea batatas Poir.)", "Abstrak": "Cylas formicarius Fab. or sweet potato weevil, is found throughout the tropics and subtropics wherever the crop is cultivated. The adults feed only on the surface of exposed roots and foliage while the larvae feed inside the tubers causing significant damage. In Cilembu, the pest found not only in the field but also during storage.The attack decreased sweet potato production quantitatively as well as qualitavely. Previous studies reported the potential of marigold (Tagetes erecta Linn.) in reducing the intensity of Cylas attack in the field. This study aims to determine the effect of marigold plants extract on feeding activity of Cylas that introduced to sweet potato tubers during storage. Extract was prepared by maceration method in ethanol 96% for 3 days. Experiment was done by smearing tubers with marigold crude extract and then placed them in plastic cups together with 10 adult Cylas . The concentrations of extract were 1 ppm (P-1), 10 ppm (P-10), 100 ppm (P-100), and 1.000 ppm (P-1000) with negative control (K-) : sweet potato only and positive control (K+) : sweet potato with Cylas. Parameters observed were of tuber fresh weight, and number of larvae in tuber and antifeedant activity of Cylas. Observations were carried out every 4 days for 24 days. Analysis of the extract compound content was carried out by GC-MS. Results showed that the increase of extract concentration will decrease tuber consumption and that highest concentration of extract (P-1000) caused the highest decrease in consumption compared to other treatments. However, the effect of the extract can only detected at the beginning of observation (four day only). P-1000 also showed the highest antifeedant activity (antifeedant index = 0.46) compared to other treatment. Larvae started to appear16th day after treatment and its number continued to increase until the 24th day. These data showed that the effect of extracts may have been reduced or dissappeared. GC-MS analysis showed 28 compounds with 13 compounds having a quality more than 85%, were belonged tothe class of fatty acids, terpenoids, and phenols. One of the phenol compounds found was (R)-6-Methoxy-2,8-dimethyl-2-((4R,8R)-4,8,12-trimethyltridecyl) chroman or coumarin. Based on the results obtained it can be concluded that the crude extract of marigold plants can reduce the feeding activity of Cylas and coumarin probably had a role in reducing palatability.", "Daftar File": {"2018 TA PP Gina Aulia 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/131650"}, "Penulis": "Gina Aulia - NIM: 10614028", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Trimurti Hesti Wardini"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Sweet potato, marigold, extract, antifeedant, Cylas formicarius", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan \u00a0\n                                     Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Sep 2018"}
