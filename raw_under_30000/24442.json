{"Nomor": 24442, "Judul": "AN INTEGRATED APPROACH OF THE OPEN-HOLE AND CASED-HOLE DATA GATHERING FOR PETROPHYSICAL INTERPRETATION OF GARUDA FIELD", "Abstrak": "Petrophysical interpretation is the hydrocarbon potential determination process using the well borehole data, either the openhole   \n \n \n\ndata or the cased-hole data. Considering the availability of variable data sources and measurements, the data used should   \n \n \n\nbe able to enhance the petrophysical interpretation technique, hence providing better hydrocarbon potential estimation with   \n \n \n\nminimum deviation. The better petrophysical interpretation can reduce the cost management in hydrocarbon production.   \n \n \n\nThis study compares the formation evaluation made by the wireline log data from exploration wells (open-hole data) with the   \n \n \n\nLWD log data from development wells (cased-hole data). This study is also intend to conduct an integrated approach of the   \n \n \n\nopen-hole data and the cased-hole data for the petrophysical interpretation at Garuda Field. The main petrophysical properties   \n \n \n\n(porosity, thickness, water saturation and gas saturation) of Beta, Cigma and Delta reservoirs, and the hydrocarbon potential   \n \n \n\nof the study area is also determined using the proposed integrated approach. The petrophysical properties for Beta reservoirs   \n \n \n\nare : porosity 13.90 %, thickness 23.81 meter, water saturation 65.60 % dan gas saturation 34.40 %. The petrophysical   \n \n \n\nproperties for Cigma reservoirs are : porosity 20.40 %, thickness 24.23 meter, water saturation 63.00 % and gas saturation   \n \n \n\n37.00 %. The petrophysical properties for Delta reservoirs are : porosity 19.60 %, thickness 36.44 meter, water saturation   \n \n \n\n66.80 % and gas saturation 33.20 % The hydrocarbon potential estimation resulted from the integrated approach is 15 %   \n \n \n\nlower than that of the previous estimation. Such approach provides a better hydrocarbon potential estimation, thus can be   \n \n \n\nused for a better Gas Field Development Plan.", "Daftar File": {"2012 TS PP SYAHRANI 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/123280"}, "Penulis": "SYAHRANI (NIM : 22311019)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["#CONTRIBUTOR#"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Geofisika - FTTM", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Petrophysical", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Okt 2017"}
