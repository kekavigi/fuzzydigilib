However, it is lack of explanation variable as many researchers find its anomaly in explaining market excess return. According to Subrahmanyan (2010) CAPM anomalies are categorized into two type, (i) informal reasoning anomalies such as Fama and French (1993) three-factor model, and (ii) liquidity anomalies such as Amihud (2002) ILLIQ. There has been a debate in liquidity anomalies regarding PIN, probability of informed trading, whether it is priced in the market or not. This research analyzes a new perspective of PIN by decomposing Duarte and Young (2009) AdjPIN and PSOS into good news related, and bad news related, following Brennan et al (2016) framework, and analyzes the behavior of PIN variable value weighted portfolio. The result shows that our proposed model is better than the original Duarte and Young (2009) in equal weighted portfolio with higher R2 and higher GRS test rejection. PSOS B is robust positive significantly affect portfolio excess return. In line with Brennan et al. (2016), investors value bad news private information more than good news private information.", "Daftar File": {"2017 TS PP FAISHAL AHMAD FARROSI 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/113162", "COVER FAISHAL AHMAD FARROSI (NIM : 29015011)": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246094", "2021 TS PP AHMAD FARROSI 1-CHAFTER I.pdf\niu": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246095", "2021 TS PP AHMAD FARROSI 1-CHAFTER II.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246096", "2021 TS PP AHMAD FARROSI 1-CHAFTER III.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246097", "2021 TS PP AHMAD FARROSI 1-CHAFTER IV.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246098", "2021 TS PP AHMAD FARROSI 1-CHAFTER V.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246099", "2021 TS PP AHMAD FARROSI 1-REFERENCE.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246100"}, "Penulis": "FAISHAL AHMAD FARROSI (NIM : 29015011)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Deddy Priatmodjo Koesrindartoto"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Administrasi Bisnis", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Asset Pricing Model, PIN, AdjPIN, PSOS, Portfolio, Excess Return, Private Information Trading", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "8 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
