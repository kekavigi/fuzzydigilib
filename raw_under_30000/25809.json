These aforementioned conditions can trigger liquefaction so that the review about liquefaction potential in this area is necessary. Liquefaction occurs by trigerring condition that makes sediments loose its effective stress and replaced by pore water pressure. Liquefaction potential analysis in this study is done by using SPT data at study area, including susceptibility rating and its initiating factors. Various methods of liquefaction analysis are used to determine safety factor of liquefaction (FSL) based on sediment characteristics. Based on conducted liquefaction analysis, research area has three sediment types, they are alluvial fan sand sediment, lake clay sediment and floodplain sand-clay sediment. Ratio of CRR (Cyclic Resistance Ratio) to CSR (Cyclic Stress Ratio) of earthquake with Mw = 7.2 and Mw = 7.5 shows that research area has liquefaction risk because it has less than one SF (Safety Factor) value. Meanwhile, for the case of earthquake with Mw = 6.6 shows that research area has no liquefaction risk.", "Daftar File": {"2017 TA PP ARNANDA ADITYA BUDHI APTAMA1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/127334", "2017 TA PP ARNANDA ADITYA BUDHI APTAMA1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/127335", "2017 TA PP ARNANDA ADITYA BUDHI APTAMA1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/127336", "2017 TA PP ARNANDA ADITYA BUDHI APTAMA1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/127337", "2017 TA PP ARNANDA ADITYA BUDHI APTAMA1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/127338", "2017 TA PP ARNANDA ADITYA BUDHI APTAMA1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/127339", "2017 TA PP ARNANDA ADITYA BUDHI APTAMA1-BAB 6.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/127340", "2017 TA PP ARNANDA ADITYA BUDHI APTAMA1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/127341"}, "Penulis": "ARNANDA ADITYA BUDHI APTAMA (NIM: 12013063)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Eng.
