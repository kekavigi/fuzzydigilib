Biological, technological and economical studies of white shrimp have been widely studied. Therefore, this study was aimed to monitor the structure comunity of culturable bacteria in water and shrimp cultivation with RAS technology. The study was divided into several stages: (1) Preparation and conditioning of RAS (2) White shrimp cultivation and monitoring of water quality  (3) Sampling of water and shrimp bacteria during 84 days of culture period every two weeks, and (4) Identificaton of culturable bacteria. This study was conducted on three different stocking densities, ie 500 ind/m3, 750 ind/m3, 1000 ind/m3. The process of grow out started when the biofilter on the RAS has been conditioned, ie at the value of NH4+ and NO2- was 0 ppm. The measured water quality parameters include DO, temperature, pH, NH4+, NO2- and NO3- with values of (5.04-8.43 mg/L), (28,10-31,10 oC), (6, 6-8), (0-0,71 mg/L), (0-0,662 mg/L), (0-66,120 mg/L) stilled in range of optimum cultivation. The bacterial species identified in this system include Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Shewanella amazonensis, Aeromonas caviae, Shewanella litorisediminis, Acinetobacter radioresistens, Bowmanella pacifica, Bacillus altitudinis, Microbacterium kitamiense, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Shannon-Wiener diversity index value at stocking density 500 ind/m3, 750 ind/m3, 1000 ind/m3 were respectively 1,577; 1,728; 1,820 in water and 1,113; 1,167; 1,002 in shrimp with medium category. Sorensen similarity index value was >0,5 and did not show any difference between culturable bacteria species communities in the third stocking density. There was a predominant culturable bacteria species in water that is Shewanella litorisediminis with the abundance of >10% each time of sampling. In general, three stocking density has the same community of culturable bacteria with no best result all of them.", "Daftar File": {"2017 TA PP RIZKYANTI AULIA 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/121570"}, "Penulis": "RIZKYANTI AULIA (NIM : 10613019)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Gede Suantika"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Recirculating Aquaculture System, Litopenaeus vannamei, culturable bacteria", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
