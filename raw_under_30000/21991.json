{"Nomor": 21991, "Judul": "INCREASE IN VOLCANIC ACTIVITY DUE TO STATIC STRAIN CHANGE ASSOCIATED WITH TECTONIC EARTHQUAKES", "Abstrak": "The tectonic earthquakes may cause an increase in volcanic activity due to stress change. \n\nVolcano eruption is driven by internal and external forces. The initiating mechanisms of volcanic eruptions commonly include buoyancy, differentiation and vesiculation, injection of hot mafic magma into cooler evolved resident magma. The increase in volcanic activity may be triggered by external factors such as earth tides, daily variations in atmospheric pressure and temperature, sea level changes, and surface load variations, and earthquake. The tectonic earthquakes have been considered as one of the external forces to volcanic activity increase. Volcanic activity and tectonic earthquake may interact at different scale and mechanism. \n\nThis dissertation will discuss about interactions between tectonic strain and increase in activity of some volcanoes in Sumatra, Indonesia, in order to have a better understanding of relationship between tectonics and volcanism. The study on the relationship between tectonic strain change and volcanic activity in this research focuses on static stress triggering, which include volumetric strain value, pattern, and direction of principal strain to examine relation between tectonic strain change and increase in volcanic activity. The research determines major factors or parameters of tectonic earthquake that drive changes in volcanic activity. The methods deduced from this study will be useful to assist in mitigating volcanic eruption. \n\nGlobal CMT solutions of large earthquakes around Talang and Sinabung volcano is used to estimate strain change of the volcano induced by earthquakes and compare to volcanic activity in the views of seismicity and ground deformation during the period from 2004 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2013 2010 and from 2010 to 2013 respectively. The 2007 to 2009 of campaign GPS data around Talang volcano and 2010 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2013 2013 continuous GPS data of Sinabung volcanoes will be used to analyze strain and calculate static stress change. Deformation caused by plate movement or faulting will change the stress in the vicinity and will increase or decrease the stress in the surrounding area. The stress that accumulates in volcanic areas might lead to changes stress in the fault close to the volcano. The analysis will be supported by statistical analysis of seismic data. \n\nThe 2007 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2013 2009 deformation which is analyzed as a time series showed inflation at the southern slope of Talang volcano, defined as an increase in pressure in the body of the volcano. Fault model derived from horizontal displacement of July-August 2009 GPS measurement period shows an oblique fault (right reverse fault) shear zones that cut the top area of Talang volcano. The fault model is consistent with the pattern of epicenter distribution which have southeast \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2013 northwest trend, the focal mechanism of volcanic earthquakes recorded in Talang volcano in the period of 2007 to 2009, and the southeast-northwest trending of Sumatran dextral fault. Those data show that the activity of seismicity and deformation in Talang volcano are dominated by the movement of local structures that are affected by regional tectonic movements of the Sumatran fault. The volumetric strain due to 15 tectonic earthquakes which allows an earthquake can affect Talang volcanic activity suggesting the threshold of volumetric strain is about 5x10-9 strain; both compression and extension, with the distance less than 700km. The distribution of strain in various depths show the effect of strain change in depths to location of magma source to be affected. \n\nThe Sinabung volcano erupted in August and September 2010 and new series of eruptions have started on September 15th, 2013. The 2013 eruption was preceded by increase in seismicity and the ground displacement showed significant change since early July, 2013. The increase in Sinabung volcanic activity is believed triggered by Bireun earthquake on July 2nd, 2013. The direction of principal strain by the earthquake is perpendicular to strike direction of a fault across the Sinabung volcano. \n\nThe value and pattern of the strain on the static triggering and the distance can not be considered as the only factor controlling the earthquake-volcano interaction. Direction of principal strain thus seems to be a good candidate to explain the respond of volcanic activity to earthquake-induced static stress. The orientation of the fault plane could thus be a main factor that may favor the response of a volcano to an earthquake. A simple model for the triggering process when the tectonic earthquakes provoke increase in volcanic activity is proposed. When extensional strain acts on the fault perpendicularly to the plane, failure will be initiated and will be associated with fracturing growth, facilitated dike propagation and eruption.", "Daftar File": {"2015 DIS PP ESTU KRISWATI 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/112903", "2015 DIS PP ESTU KRISWATI 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/112904", "2015 DIS PP ESTU KRISWATI 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/112905", "2015 DIS PP ESTU KRISWATI 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/112906", "2015 DIS PP ESTU KRISWATI 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/112907", "2015 DIS PP ESTU KRISWATI 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/112908", "2015 DIS PP ESTU KRISWATI 1-BAB 6.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/112909", "2015 DIS PP ESTU KRISWATI 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/112910"}, "Penulis": "ESTU KRISWATI (NIM : 35110003)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : \n\nProf. Dr. Ir.
