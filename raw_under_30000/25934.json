{"Nomor": 25934, "Judul": "PATTERNS IN BUILDING SOFTWARE FOR A MIDDLE SIZE LEAGUE ROBOT USING ROBOT OPERATING SYSTEM", "Abstrak": "There are many ways to build the software for a Middle Size League (MSL) robot. A common problem in developing software for any long-term project including MSL is allowing future developers to maintain and continue further research on the project. A solution to this problem is to use an already existing software development framework. In recent years, the Robot Operating System (ROS) has become the 'de facto' standard framework for robotics software development. This thesis will explore the advantages found in using ROS as the framework for building software for a robot. Given the size of the project, this thesis will limit itself with only discussing the software for the robot's locomotion system.  \n\nThe three main advantages that were found by our team in using ROS are data sharing, hardware abstraction, and program concurrency. These advantages allowed the team to build modular software that is more maintainable. Furthermore, there was minimum cost found in using ROS. Using a kinematic model of the locomotion system, when given a linear velocity command, the robot overshoots the command by 10.1%. When given an angular velocity command, the robot undershoots the command by 6.4%. When comparing the target frequency with the actual frequency of the program that ran the locomotion system, it was found that the actual frequency was within 99.645% of the target frequency.", "Daftar File": {"2018 TA PP AULIA WIDYAPUTRA 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/127672"}, "Penulis": "AULIA WIDYAPUTRA (NIM : 13212057)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Tim Pembimbing :  \n\nDr. Kusprasapta Mutijarsa S.T., M.T.  \n\nDr. Widyawardana Adiprawita S.T., M.T.  \n\nDr. Fadhil Hidayat S.Kom., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Middle Size League (MSL), Robot Operating System (ROS), locomotion system, data sharing, hardware abstraction, program concurrency", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti \u00a0\n                                     Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Jul 2018"}
