{"Nomor": 21948, "Judul": "NEW NUMERICAL EQUATION ON CRITICAL PRODUCTION AND OPTIMUM RATE FOR HORIZONTAL WELL IN BOTTOM WATER DRIVE MECHANISM", "Abstrak": "Water coning is a serious problem in oil production operations. Despite the fact of common occurrences of water production from thin oil reservoir, it actually increases the cost of producing or lifting operations and reduces the efficiency of depletion mechanism and overall recovery. After water breakthroughs the wellbore, the water phase will increase and gradually becomes dominant over oil.   \n\nConing behavior in horizontal well is still not fully understood. Lacks of knowledge of reservoir heterogeneity and fluid distribution within the reservoir have led to either over-prediction or under-prediction on parameters   \n\ncontrolling water coning.   \n\nMuskat and Wyckoff (1935) proposed a simple formulation for water coning in vertical well. Based on Muskat definition, water coning problem could be minimized by doing control on critical production rate, that is a   \n\nmaximum production rate, which does not affect cone/crest stability. Some studies have been conducted to analyze   \n\nwater coning behavior in horizontal well such as Chaperon (mathematically; 1983), Abbas (physical and laboratory; 1988), Papatzacos (mathematically; 1991), and Izwardhy (empirically; 2011). However, those research were not taken in integrated factors, so coning analysis in horizontal well still need to be developed in terms of   \n\nsome specific reservoir parameters that have never been used in previous studies.   \n\nThe objective of this study is to analyze water coning behavior and do sensitivity tests of certain parameters   \n\naffecting critical and optimum production rates in horizontal well in bottom water drive systems. This research uses commercial numerical simulator to analyze the sensitivity for each parameters.   \n\nEmpirical equations to calculate critical and optimum production rates have been developed using CMG simulator   \n\nas well as the sensitivity studies of the reservoir parameters.", "Daftar File": {"2013 TA PP PHILIP ALBERT HUTAPEA 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/112731"}, "Penulis": "ENGGAR AMRETACAHYA (NIM. 12209052)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Prof. Ir.
