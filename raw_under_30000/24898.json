{"Nomor": 24898, "Judul": "POWER QUALITY IMPROVEMENT BY USING STATIONARY REFERENCE FRAME BASED DVR FOR MITIGATING UNBALANCED VOLTAGE SAG", "Abstrak": "Power quality problem in distribution system become more serious matter since the \n\nadvancement in industrial equipment which require good power quality to ensure \n\nthe sustainability of the production process. Voltage sag is one of the power quality \n\nproblems that most probably happened caused by either normal or abnormal event \n\nin power system. Dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) can be chosen as a preferred \n\napproach to improve voltage quality at sensitive load locations. This study proposes \n\ntwo control strategies to compensate the balanced and unbalanced voltage sag with \n\nenhance dq frame method with PI control and simplified \u03b1\u03b2 frame method with PR \n\ncontroller. The unbalanced voltage sag condition caused by single line ground fault \n\n(SLGF), which is most probably happened in distribution system, can be \n\ncompensated well by these methods. Additional feature is coming from PR \n\ncontroller in \u03b1\u03b2 frame which plays an important role in performing better voltage \n\ntracking error, compared to PI controller in dq frame as an enhance comparison. \n\nPSIM simulation result has been presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the \n\nproposed method.", "Daftar File": {"2018 TS PP ABDUL QODIR JAELANI  1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/125194"}, "Penulis": "ABDUL QODIR JAELANI (NIM : 23216033)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Tim Pembimbing : \n\nDr. Ir.
