{"Nomor": 24133, "Judul": "THE IMPACT OF URBAN GROWTH ON FOOD SECURITY AND THE ROLE OF PLANNING (CASE STUDY: MOJOKERTO REGENCY INDONESIA)", "Abstrak": "better understanding of the impact of urban growth on agricultural land and food security is necessary for the design of appropriate strategies. Review of the existing of planning on food security is also important to improve the level of food security. Therefore, the aim of this research is to investigate whether a relationship can be found between agricultural land, urban growth and food security and to evaluate the role of planning on food security. The research was conducted in Mojokerto Regency, Indonesia.   \n \n \n\nIn this research, secondary data from three years (2005, 2009 and 2013) were used to analyse food security and vulnerability. The method was based on three dimensions and nine indicators of food security. Land cover maps were generated for each year to support the statistical data. Planning documents were reviewed to obtain information about the extent to which food security had been taken into account in planning. Finally descriptive analysis was used to explain the trends of urban growth, agricultural land, food security and the role of planning.   \n \n \n\nThe result, based on food security and vulnerability composite index (FSVCi), showed an increase in the level of food security in 2005, 2009 and 2013. At the same time, urban area increased and the loss of agricultural land also increased. In addition, planning review showed that all nine indicators of the three food security dimensions were taken into account in the planning but not directly use food security as the aim.   \n \n \n\nThe finding shows that the relationship between agricultural land, urban growth and food security cannot be concluded yet and need further research. At the same time, even though attention about food security has not directly stated in planning but those documents consider all indicators of food security which could have mitigated the adverse effects of land cover change on food security.", "Daftar File": {"2016 TS PP RUSDYAWAN ARIEF S 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/121770", "2016 TS PP RUSDYAWAN ARIEF S 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/121771", "2016 TS PP RUSDYAWAN ARIEF S 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/121772", "2016 TS PP RUSDYAWAN ARIEF S 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/121773", "2016 TS PP RUSDYAWAN ARIEF S 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/121774", "2016 TS PP RUSDYAWAN ARIEF S 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/121775", "2016 TS PP RUSDYAWAN ARIEF S 1-BAB 6.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/121776", "2016 TS PP RUSDYAWAN ARIEF S 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/121777"}, "Penulis": "RUSDYAWAN ARIEF S (ITB: 25413012) (ITC: s6019331)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing :    \n \n \n\nDrs.
