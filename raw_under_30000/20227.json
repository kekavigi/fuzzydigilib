{"Nomor": 20227, "Judul": "3D RESERVOIR MODEL OF THE T RESERVOIR WIRRAH FIELD GIPPSLAND BASIN, AUSTRALIA", "Abstrak": "T reservoir is one of the hydrocarbon reservoirs that are located within the Wirrah field in the Gippsland Basin, Australia. The reservoir has been discovered during the drilling of 3 exploration wells in the Wirrah field in the 1980's. The field has been abandoned since then due to very low price of hydrocarbon which then makes the field become sub-economical to be developed. In the present time the hydrocarbon price soar very rapidly. This makes the development of this field/reservoir become very feasible in the near future. The aim of this research project is to build a 3D reservoir model of the T-reservoir to be the base of future field development plan. The 3D reservoir model was built by combining all the result of reservoir characterization from interpreting available data that was obtain from the State of Victoria Department of Primary Industry and utilizing the geostatistics method. The interpretation of the data shows that the T-reservoir is sand reservoir resulted from the deposition of strandplain deposit in a transitional environment. T-reservoir structure is anticline bounded to the north by reverse fault. From the 3D reservoir model the P10, P50, and P90 volumetric of the reservoir can be predicted which are 4.54 Bcf, 3.06 Bcf and 1.84 Bcf respectively so that appropriate field development plan can be executed to produce the hydrocarbon from this reservoir.", "Daftar File": {"2012 TS PP JOKO SOSIAWAN TRIKUKUH 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/103627", "2012 TS PP JOKO SOSIAWAN TRIKUKUH 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/103628", "2012 TS PP JOKO SOSIAWAN TRIKUKUH 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/103629", "2012 TS PP JOKO SOSIAWAN TRIKUKUH 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/103630", "2012 TS PP JOKO SOSIAWAN TRIKUKUH 1-BAB 4A.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/103631", "2012 TS PP JOKO SOSIAWAN TRIKUKUH 1-BAB 4B.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/103632", "2012 TS PP JOKO SOSIAWAN TRIKUKUH 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/103633", "2012 TS PP JOKO SOSIAWAN TRIKUKUH 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/103634"}, "Penulis": "JOKO SOSIAWAN TRIKUKUH (NIM : 22311009)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Prof. Dr. Che Aziz Ali"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Geofisika - FTTM", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Reservoir T, the hydrocarbon reservoirs, the Wirrah field in the Gippsland Basin, Australia, 3D Reservoir model.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "8 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Okt 2017"}
