{"Nomor": 23837, "Judul": "MEASURING THE PERFORMANCE OF INDONESIA'S DEFENCE ACQUISITION SYSTEM", "Abstrak": "All countries, including Indonesia, have an acquisition or procurement program for developing its armed forces.  The aim of these programs is to maintain and raise the capability of the armed forces in its duty to the defence and security of its nation.  Without proper acquisition, the institutions whose role is the defence and security of the nation will lose its capability in performing those roles, thus risking the country to the threats that could be disastrous to the country and even risk of the annihilation of the country.  Although maintaining and increasing the capability of countries armed forces and other security actors is at the utmost importance, no country will have unlimited resources for the acquisition and support that is needed.  So, it is very important for governments to manage the limited resources they have and still be able to provide the need for procurement and other acquisition activities so that the armed forces and other security institutions have the capability necessary for defending and securing the state and its nation.  This is done through creating an acquisition system that is effective and efficient.The aim of this research is to provide a standard for a defence acquisition system that meets these demands.  Within this paper it will discuss the principles of good governance, with its principles of transparency and accountability, and the principles of Smart Acquisition that is developed in the United Kingdom.  It will try to compare these principles to the conditions in reality.  Although the data collecting of this research is through qualitative means, it does not mean that it can't be quantified.  The performance measurement is done using a modification of the Data Envelopment Analysis and Weighted Ratio Analysis.The result of the research is that although Indonesia has developed a strong strategic guidance for acquisition planning through the General Defence Policy, Presidential Decree no 7/2008, there is a lack within the acquisition process itself.  This can especially be seen with the lack of involvement of the private sector, involvement of all stakeholders within requirement measurement, and partnership with suppliers of equipments.", "Daftar File": {"2008 TS PP RANGGA JANTAN WARGADALAM 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/120481", "2008 TS PP RANGGA JANTAN WARGADALAM 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/120482", "2008 TS PP RANGGA JANTAN WARGADALAM 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/120483", "2008 TS PP RANGGA JANTAN WARGADALAM 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/120484", "2008 TS PP RANGGA JANTAN WARGADALAM 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/120485", "2008 TS PP RANGGA JANTAN WARGADALAM 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/120486", "2008 TS PP RANGGA JANTAN WARGADALAM 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/120487"}, "Penulis": "RANGGA JANTAN WARGADALAM (NIM: 24006028)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. Ir.
