{"Nomor": 21666, "Judul": "ANALYSIS OF TCAS RA WITH NO RISK OF COLLISION IN JAKARTA-FIR FOR DESCENT AGAINST CRUISE FLIGHT PHASE CASES (DECEMBER 2016-FEBRUARY 2017)", "Abstrak": "The growth of air transport has led to an increase in air traffic which greatly heightened the probability of mid-air collision. The airport that suffers the most by congestion of air traffic in Indonesia is Soekarno-Hatta International Airport which is also the location of most airprox (air traffic incident) occurrence.    \n \n \n \n\nTo minimize the probability of air traffic\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s accident and incident, air traffic controllers (ATC), including Soekarno-Hatta International Airport ATC, nowadays use Short-Term Conflict Alert and most commercial aircraft are required to have Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). However, occasionally TCAS gives Resolution Advisory (RA) warning even though the traffic has already been given separation minima based on the regulation and considered safe by the air traffic controller. This event is called TCAS RA with No Risk of Collision,    \n \n \n \n\nThe objective of this thesis is to analyze the TCAS RA cases with no risk of collision data, to analyze the characteristic differences between TCAS and STCA systems, to analyze AIC No.2 Recommendation from Directorate of General Aviation (DGCA), and to review the regulations related. From data provided by National Transportation Safety Committee, in 2016 there are 15.6% TCAS RA cases with no risk of collision from all airprox events in Indonesia that were occurred in Jakarta-FIR.    \n \n \n \n\nThis thesis will provide the vertical speed and closing speed limitation calculation for TCAS and also the analysis of five TCAS RA cases with no risk of collision from Airline A&C\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s FDR data. From the analysis, it is known that there are various causes that caused TCAS RA warning alerted mostly were caused by high vertical speed and ground speed. To reduce the probability of TCAS RA with no risk of collision it is very recommended for the operator to comply to AIC No.2.", "Daftar File": {"2017 TA PP DESTYA MAHARANI RACHMAN 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/111491"}, "Penulis": "DESTYA MAHARANI RACHMAN (NIM : 13613023)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Hisar M.
