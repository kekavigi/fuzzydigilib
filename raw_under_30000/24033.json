{"Nomor": 24033, "Judul": "Biosilika Navicula sp. sebagai Bahan Baku untuk Sintesis Zeolit", "Abstrak": "In Indonesia, natural sources of silica sources such as rice husks, sands, and microalgae are abundance. Navicula sp. is a kind of diatomous microalgae   \n \n\npossessing an unique morphology and nanoporous cell walls that are potential for silica sources to synthesize zeolite. The purpose of the present study was to convert biosilica from Navicula sp. cell wall to zeolite using the hydrothermal method. The scope of this research included the cultivation of microalgae to produce biomass, optimation of algae growth in a various concentration of sodium aluminate in medium, determination of silica content in the Navicula sp cell using the method of thermal gravimetric analysis, isolation of Navicula sp. biosilica using acid treatment and calcination of the biosilica in a furnace at 600 oC, analysis of functional groups of Navicula sp. biosilica with FTIR and identification of morphology and atom content of the biosilica with SEM-EDS. The zeolite was synthesised from a reaction mixture of silica:NaAlO2:NaOH:TEABr:Aqua dm with a molar ratio of 25:1.6:4.4:18:440. The results showed that the biomass of Navicula sp. was harvested at the 7th day with the avarage biomass density obtained of 4.12\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b10.27 g/L and cell density of (8.39\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b10.23)\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u2014106 cells/mL. The result of TGA showed wet cell of Navicula sp. containing 9.57% H2O, 26.66% organic compounds, and 63.77% biosilica. The morphology of Navicula sp. biosilica was boat-like oval with the pore size of ~1.28 \u03bcm. FTIR spectrum of Navicula sp. biosilica showed vibrations of Si\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2013O\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2013Si at wave number of 470, 809, and 1.092 cm\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u20131 and no Al\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2013O vibration was observed indicating aluminate was not required for the cell-wall formation. The difractogram of zeolite crsystals showed that zeolites synthesized from ludox has similarity with beta zeolite, meanwhile zeolite from biosilica was similar to zeolite ZSM-5.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "RISKA SAPITRI (NIM: 10511023)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing :  \n \n\nProf.Zeily Nurachman, D.Sc.  \n \n\nDr.rer.nat Rino R.Mukti"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "microalgae, Navicula sp., biosilika, zeolit, hidrotermal", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
