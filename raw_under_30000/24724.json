{"Nomor": 24724, "Judul": "GAS HYDRATE SEISMIC IDENTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATIONS IN X BASIN, WEST SULAWESI", "Abstrak": "Gas hydrate is solid solution which is formed when gas   \n \n \n\nmolecules were trapped in crystal lattices that is   \n \n \n\nformed by water molecules at low temperature and   \n \n \n\nhigh pressure. So that gas hydrate commonly found in   \n \n \n\npermafrost and deep water ocean along continental   \n \n \n\nmargin. In Indonesia, gas hydrate can be found in deep   \n \n \n\nocean along subduction zone, such as Sunda Arc Basin   \n \n \n\nand X Basin. X Basin is located at western Sulawesi.   \n \n \n\nThe presence of gas hydrate in nature can be   \n \n \n\nrepresented by Bottom Simulating Reflector (BSR) on   \n \n \n\nseismic section. BSR occur if gas hydrate bearing   \n \n \n\nsediment and gas/water bearing sediment below has a   \n \n \n\nnegative contrast acoustic impedance. Those negative   \n \n \n\nvalue is caused by the increasing of P- and S-wave   \n \n \n\nvelocity and density in gas hydrate bearing sediment.   \n \n \n\n3D seismic acquisition has been conducted in X   \n \n \n\nBasin. The data was processed so gas hydrate in this   \n \n \n\nbasin can be identified and characterized. Firstly, the   \n \n \n\npreliminary seismic data processing was conducted to   \n \n \n\nproduce a good quality seismic section/gathers.   \n \n \n\nSecondly, this seismic section/gathers are developed   \n \n \n\nby using advance seismic processing, such as seismic   \n \n \n\nattributes, and AVO methods. Unfortunately, there is   \n \n \n\nno well log data for this study, so the identification and characterization has been done as an estimation   \n \n \n\nwithout an accurate validation.   \n \n \n\nSeismic section/gathers in this study give   \n \n \n\ninformation about the presence of gas hydrate. BSRs   \n \n \n\ncan be seen clearly almost in every along the crossline   \n \n \n\ndirection and they can be used as preliminary   \n \n \n\nidentification. Furthermore, RMS amplitude slice   \n \n \n\nsection and apparent polarity resulted in the same way.   \n \n \n\nThrough the seismic attribute method, gas hydrate   \n \n \n\nbearing sediment velocity can be estimated around   \n \n \n\n2000 m/s with 100 m of thickness.", "Daftar File": {"2012 TS PP WINA FITRIAH 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/124440"}, "Penulis": "WINA FITRIAH (NIM : 22310014)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Awali Priyono"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Geofisika - FTTM", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "BSR, apparent polarity, instantaneous phase, AVO", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Okt 2017"}
