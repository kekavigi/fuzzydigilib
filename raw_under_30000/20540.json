{"Nomor": 20540, "Judul": "A STUDY OF SAND PRODUCTION RATE PREDICTION IN OIL AND GAS RESERVOIRS", "Abstrak": "Sand production, caused by the formation failure due to in-situ stress and fluid flow, is prevalent during production of oil and gas from sandstone reservoirs. It is important to understand sand production from reservoirs since it can be very harmful to the facilities (excessive erosion, plugging, well sand-up, separator fill, etc.). Understanding the causes of sand production in a field helps to accurately predict sand production rates. The prediction of sand production requires bottom-hole load conditions, drawdown, time, etc. This sand prediction thesis model captures both the geomechanical aspects (rock deformation and failure) and the transport aspects (e.g. role of drawdown and watercut) of the sand production problem.  \n \n\nOne very important parameter is formation strength represented by UCS (Unconfined Compressive Strength) that is determined by petrophysical analysis and data. Formation strength leads particular reason of the evolution of intact zone to plastic zone that causes sand is produced to the wellbore. This research study employs particular analytical solutions from van den Hoek and Geilikman\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s methods that are used to predict the sand production rate as function of bottom-hole load condition, drawdown, and time. These methods consider transient fluid flow into the wellbore for radial case, sand producing in the wellbore, and sand lifting to the surface. This study uses numerical approach to determine generalized pressure transient solution and the Stehfest algorithm to solve Laplace space inversion.  \n \n\nResults of this study can predict sand production potential of a produced well through the sand production rates profile over time. It also shows the maximum sand rates and volume, and determines at what time the sand firstly produced. Using a set of a particular field data shows that sand will start produced at 36 month while the maximum sand production rate is 0.0031061 liter/day at 60 month. In the presence of fluid flow, the amount of sand produced is directly related to the flow-induces change in volumetric plastic strain around the wellbore.", "Daftar File": {"2013 TS PP SRI KONSEP HARUM WICAKSONO 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106015", "2013 TS PP SRI KONSEP HARUM WICAKSONO 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106016", "2013 TS PP SRI KONSEP HARUM WICAKSONO 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106017", "2013 TS PP SRI KONSEP HARUM WICAKSONO 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106018", "2013 TS PP SRI KONSEP HARUM WICAKSONO 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106019", "2013 TS PP SRI KONSEP HARUM WICAKSONO 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106020", "2013 TS PP SRI KONSEP HARUM WICAKSONO 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/106021"}, "Penulis": "SRI KONSEP HARUM WICAKSONO (NIM: 22211051)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Ir.
