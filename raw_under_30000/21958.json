Leaving their children care to others caused the parents lose the sight of their child\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s development and education. As a result, many kids nowadays live individualistic and lack of social life. This phenomenon indeed is happening in Jakarta.  \n \n\nAs in Indonesia, the child development and education are not viewed as the crucial issues by their parents. The built environment/architectural space that enhance those have often been overlooked. There are hardly to find a child-friendly space and no proper guideline to design those spaces. Thus, many child spaces in Indonesia are poorly designed without considering the children\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s developmental needs, interests, abilities and learning styles.  \n \n\nIn response to the phenomenon happens in Jakarta which demands architectural spaces that enhance educational process (learning) and experiential learning (play) for children, architectural approaches that will fit in Jakarta to fulfill children needs associated with their growth and development skills will be elaborated through this thesis.", "Daftar File": {"2016 TS PP ERICA IVONNY TEK 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/112753", "2016 TS PP ERICA IVONNY TEK 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/112754", "2016 TS PP ERICA IVONNY TEK 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/112755", "2016 TS PP ERICA IVONNY TEK 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/112756", "2016 TS PP ERICA IVONNY TEK 1-BAB 4A.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/112757", "2016 TS PP ERICA IVONNY TEK 1-BAB 4B.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/112758", "2016 TS PP ERICA IVONNY TEK 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/112759", "2016 TS PP ERICA IVONNY TEK 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/112760"}, "Penulis": "ERICA IVONNY TEK (NIM: 252 14 023)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing :   \n \n\nDr. Ir.
