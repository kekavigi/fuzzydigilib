{"Nomor": 20763, "Judul": "TOWARD A GENDER-BALANCED ORGANIZATION :EXPLORING MASCULINITY AND FEMININITY EMBEDDED IN AN INDONESIAN STATE-OWNED COMPANY", "Abstrak": "An organization that is gender-biased on the inside is arguably incapable of  \n\nproducing gender-equitable outcomes, which often hold back those with gender \n\ndisadvantage to grow in the organization. Understanding whether and how an \n\norganization is \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u201cgendered\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u201d should be seen from its deep structure that underlies the \n\nsystemic factors that set the way of working in the organization. Given the low \n\nnumber of women present in the executive position in PT. MUSIA arguably \n\nindicating that the organization is a masculine organization, the researchers aim to \n\nunderstand how gendered the organization is by exploring the masculinity and \n\nfemininity of the organization seen through three related lenses: the core (expected) \n\nbehaviours, working environment, and performance appraisal. Using a mix of \n\nqualitative and quantitative methods, the researchers used in-depth interview to \n\nexplore employees\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019 interpretation toward the organization\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s core behaviours, \n\nobservation to understand the working environment, and survey to assess the \n\ngender traits embedded in the performance appraisal indicators. Based on the \n\noverall analysis across the three related aspects of the organization, PT. MUSIA is \n\nshown to be a masculine-inclined organization. The outcome of this research is a \n\nproposal for improvement in its system to have a more gender-balanced system for \n\nthe organization.", "Daftar File": {"2017 TA PP ADLYA NABILA  1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/107498", "2017 TS PP ADLYA NABILA 1 - FULL TEXT.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/251855"}, "Penulis": "ADLYA NABILA (NIM 19014129)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["ANDIKA PUTRA PRATAMA, Ph.D"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "gendered organization, masculinity, femininity, core behaviours, working environment, performance appraisal", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Taupik Abidin \u00a0\n                                     Taupik Abidin", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Sep 2017"}
