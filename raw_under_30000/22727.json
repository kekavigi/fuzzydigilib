{"Nomor": 22727, "Judul": "ROCK PHYSICS TEMPLATE APPLICATION ON CARBONATE RESERVOIR", "Abstrak": "A good petroleum system needs a good reservoir to properly accommodate. \n\nThus it needs a good characterization to fully understand its properties, in \n\nwhich one of the method known is by utilizing Rock Physics Template \n\n(RPT). This method attempts to characterize a reservoir in order to predict \n\nthe behavior of the reservoir, such as different porosities and water \n\nsaturation. However, most of RPT technique applications are limited to \n\ngranular rocks and not enough on carbonates. Although carbonates \n\ngenerally have good properties as reservoir rocks, it is proven to be more \n\ndifficult to ascertain. The complex system of carbonates porosities often \n\ngives scatter pattern on the porosity and P-wave relationship. Therefore, this \n\nresearch will attempt to use RPT to model carbonate reservoir. This will be \n\nachieved by using Kuster Toksoz as the basis for carbonate rock modeling \n\nand by the help from Biot-Gassmann equation. The study object of this \n\nthesis is on Baturaja formation that is located in South Sumatra Basin. This \n\nformation is known to be a carbonate reservoir that has produced gas \n\nhydrocarbon. This thesis offers an approach on how to better understand the \n\napplication of RPT on Baturaja formation. Based on the RPT modeling \n\ndone in this research, some specific parameter needs to be obtained in order \n\nto develop a functional RPT model. These parameters are aspect ratio of the \n\nporosities and elastic modulus of the minerals.", "Daftar File": {"2017 TS PP JUDY HILMAN 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/115943"}, "Penulis": "JUDY HILMAN (NIM : 22315011)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Ignatius  Sonny Winardhi, Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Rock Physics Template, Carbonate, Aspect Ratio", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti \u00a0\n                                     Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Sep 2017"}
