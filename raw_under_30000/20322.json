{"Nomor": 20322, "Judul": "2-D MT MODELING ANALYSIS  TO REDUCE OCEANIC COAST EFFECT AND STATIC SHIFT", "Abstrak": "Presence of sea water near the MT measurement sites and shallow inhomogeneities can lead to several problems of accuracy in modeling of magnetotelluric (MT) data. The problem caused by the presence of sea water near measurement sites is distortion in modeling that can influence the inversion result for interpretation. Shallow inhomogeneities can lead to shifting apparent resistivity sounding curve and galvanic distortion of MT data.   \n \n \n\nTo reduce the oceanic effect an initial model is needed with coast geometry and resistivity model fixed to obtain better model than using homogeneous initial model. The inversion result with fixed coast geometry and resistivity model can produce models with better position and distribution of resistivity. TM mode is least affected by static shift effects. The inversion result shows the static effect will be reduced when TM mode is used for inversion and combined with static option in WinGLink Software.", "Daftar File": {"2013 TS PP MUHAMMAD KURNIAWAN ALFADLI 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/104371", "2013 TS PP MUHAMMAD KURNIAWAN ALFADLI 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/104372", "2013 TS PP MUHAMMAD KURNIAWAN ALFADLI 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/104373", "2013 TS PP MUHAMMAD KURNIAWAN ALFADLI 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/104374", "2013 TS PP MUHAMMAD KURNIAWAN ALFADLI 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/104375", "2013 TS PP MUHAMMAD KURNIAWAN ALFADLI 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/104376", "2013 TS PP MUHAMMAD KURNIAWAN ALFADLI 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/104377"}, "Penulis": "MUHAMMAD KURNIAWAN ALFADLI (NIM : 22310302)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Hendra Grandis"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Geofisika - FTTM", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Magnetotelluric, oceanic effect, static shift, modeling", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Okt 2017"}
