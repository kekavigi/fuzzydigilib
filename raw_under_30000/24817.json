Empirical analysis presents that under normal condition, the performance of the bond portfolio with sentiment provides higher return than without sentiment, except for liquidity portfolio with long rebalancing period and Sharpe-Ratio portfolio. Market outstanding portfolio with sentiment for long rebalancing period outperforms the other portfolios and also the index in the long run. Under crisis condition, the performance of bond portfolio with sentiment provides higher return than without sentiment for long rebalancing period, except for Sharpe-Ratio portfolio. For short rebalancing period, sentiment is not effective only for market outstanding portfolio. Sharpe-Ratio portfolio without sentiment for long rebalancing period outperforms the other portfolios.", "Daftar File": {"2017 TS PP YUDIONO OMAR 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/124854", "2020 TS PP YUDIONO OMAR 1 - FULL TEXT.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/247204"}, "Penulis": "YUDIONO OMAR (Student ID : 29014023)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Supervisor : Deddy P.
