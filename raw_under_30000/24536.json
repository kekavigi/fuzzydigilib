{"Nomor": 24536, "Judul": "RESERVOIR SIMULATION OF A NATURALLY FRACTURED SEMI OFFSHORE OIL FIELD FOR OPTIMIZING FUTURE DEVELOPMENT", "Abstrak": "The field (T-field) is a semi offshore oil field where all of the production facility is constructed on the manmade island and wells are drilled from this island by                   \n \n\nland rig. The reservoir n T-field is Miocene Bioclastic Limestone dominated by naturally fractured with area 1650 acres, average porosity 17.5% and water saturation 13% where OWC is estimated at -8544 ftSS and maximum thickness of oil is about 1496 ft. The presence of natural fractured reservoirs is identified from core thin section, sonic log and also well transient test analysis. Since T-field is naturally fracture reservoir, the dual porosity system is used with precaution on better definition of a reservoir characterization in populating the simulation grid to history match the                   \n \n\nactual performance and predict the future performance. Due to limitation of fracture data, the modeling is based on conceptual model where the model assuming that fractures distribution will be strongly controlled by proximity to fault, maximum curvatures and stress model.                   \n \n\nNumerical simulation modeling involving a naturally fractured behavior of the reservoir is proposed for better monitoring and predicting the performance of Tfield as wells as supporting the optimum development of the field. The optimum means the future development that will give the maximum economic return with evaluation of some economic parameters to contractor and government. The economic analysis is run based on the JOB-PSC contract term. The scenarios are related to number of new wells and their types. By exercising some scenarios, the optimum future development is resulted from scenario of additional multilateral well with three branches.                   \n \n\nFuture development with pressure maintenance by water or gas injection is also exercised. These scenarios give lower oil recovery since the early breakthrough of the injected fluids. The presence of fracture gives influence to this early breakthrough.", "Daftar File": {"2009 TS PP TIMUR M.
