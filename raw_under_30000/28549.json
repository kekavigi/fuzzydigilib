Gas injection methods are also reviewed. \n\nCoiled Tubing Drilling (CTD) has reached its popularity in last two decades. In principle, CTD provides hydraulic horsepower which is transfered to the bottomhole. CT itself, in operation, has advantages and disadvantages compared to jointed pipe. CT Unit (CTU) are complete package consists of surface and subsurface equipments. \n\nField \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u201cA\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u201d located in Indonesia will be drilled dual lateral using underbalanced drilling technique. The reservoir has been highly depleted, low reservoir pressure about 1130 psi and high bottom hole temperature about 350oF. This field produced natural gas and condensate which contains 80-100 ppm H2S, 15% CO2, and water. Underbalanced drilling is conducted due to minimize potential problems. From several choices, Coiled Tubing with nitirified mud is selected to perform underbalanced. \n\nCombination of CTD and underbalanced drilling, which is dual lateral drilling, delivers maximum productivity improvement compared to single lateral. This is obtained from well performance study or upflow performance study from existing wells. This study is conducted to estimate productivity improvement for various lateral configurations, liner diameter, and well position \n\nEventually, for Field \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u201cA\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u201d, dual lateral UBD system with 7\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u201d liner and lateral length 1500 ft results the highest PI improvement, which is 3.67 times higher. Drilling fluid used is nitrified mud due to several technical reasons. From five well configurations, CT 2-7/8\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u201d with 6\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u201d hole is the best drilled using Neyrfor-Weir Motor. Recommended liquid rate is from 10 gpm to 25 gpm and gas injection rate is from 1100 scfm to 1725 scfm.", "Daftar File": {"2012 TA PP LAMDAMATRA ARLIYANDO 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/134051"}, "Penulis": "LAMDAMATRA ARLIYANDO (NIM : 12208077)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr-Ing.
