{"Nomor": 21400, "Judul": "ANALISA PROSES BISNIS TERMINAL KARGO EKSISTING BANDARA INTERNASIONAL SOEKARNO HATTA", "Abstrak": "The biggest and busiest airport in Indonesia is Soekarno Hatta International Airport (SHIA) with 58.2 million passengers and 597,807,352 kg of cargo in 2016. Company that manage and do business of airport and airport related service including cargo terminals in SHIA and all airports in Western part of Indonesia is PT. Angkasa Pura II. Since 2013 the capacity of the existing Cargo Terminal SHIA has increased about 700,000 per year. The actual capacity of the existing Cargo Terminal SHIA is around 430,000 tons per year. The excess capacity affected the cargo flow in cargo terminal, such as truck congestion, insufficient Cargo Terminal warehouses, and longer cargo processes. Those problems affected the efficiency in cargo processes.  The objective of this final project is developed and proposes new business process to improve current cargo process in the existing Cargo Terminal SHIA and to support the operation of developed future Cargo Village SHIA for more efficient business process than the existing Cargo Terminal SHIA.  This study will develop and propose new business process for improvement the existing of Cargo Terminal SHIA.  The new business process is also implemented for develop future Cargo Village SHIA. This study will analyze, measure, and improve the current business process of existing Cargo Terminal SHIA by using some methods such as, Lean Supply Chain and Value Stream Mapping (VSM).Those methods will identify, visualize, and eliminate non value added activities or waste in current business process of existing Cargo Terminal SHIA. The current business process of existing Cargo Terminal SHIA consists of export, import, and domestic cargo process flows. This study also conducted root cause analysis to find the problem that caused inefficient business process in current business process of existing Cargo Terminal SHIA. To develop efficient business process in existing Cargo Terminal SHIA, this study conducted benchmarking with best practice cargo terminal worldwide that has efficient business process. The benchmarking results will give input to improvement of business process in existing Cargo Terminal and also give insight to Cargo Village development plan to use them as reference to develop new business processes.  \n\nNon value added activities or waste in outbound and inbound cargo process flows lead to inefficient business process in existing Cargo Terminal SHIA. The lead time and processing time of outbound cargo process are respectively 25.67 minutes and 133 minutes. The international inbound cargo process flow has 40 seconds and 3.02 days of lead time and processing time respectively. By eliminating non value added activities or waste which are contained on cargo process flow in the existing Cargo Terminal, the lead time and processing time will be faster. The lead time and processing time of cargo outbound process will be reduced to 4.5 minutes and 113 minutes respectively. While lead time and processing time of international inbound cargo process is respectively becoming 40 seconds and 1.02 days. This research will help the existing Cargo Terminal has more efficient business process, this study also propose functional and product layouts for future Cargo Village SHIA to complement the new business process.", "Daftar File": {"2017 TA PP BEATRICE FORTUNATA BERINA SUWARLIM 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/110224"}, "Penulis": "BEATRICE FORTUNATA BERINA SUWARLIM  - Nim: 29115582", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
