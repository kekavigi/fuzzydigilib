{"Nomor": 21099, "Judul": "SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS ON DIFFERENT RESERVOIR PARAMETERS TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF POLYMER WATER SHUT OFF TREATMENT IN LAYERED AND HETEROGENOUS RESERVOIR", "Abstrak": "Excessive water production is a threat to the continued economic viability and can lead to premature abandonment of many oil fields, lower production rates, reduction in recoverable reserves and constitutes potential negative environmental impacts. Consequently, mechanical chemical shutoff and other water reduction techniques have been developed and deployed to curb the menace in the hydrocarbon industry. Polymers are frequently used to treat water cut producing wells in an effort to reduce water production by decreasing permeability of reservoir rock matrix so that water production can be delayed. Polymer gel is one of chemical shut off methods that found effective to overcome water channeling problem that comes from anisotropy permeability in reservoir (A. Joseph and J.A Ajienka, 2010). This paper investigated the problem of early water development in layered and heterogenous reservoir and determined the effect of different reservoir parameters on the development of water front movement in the presence of what is considered as a thief zone. A water injection in a line staggered pattern was simulated to analyze the effect of reservoir parameters on water breakthrough time and cumulative oil production. The main purpose of this paper is to predict the effective condition to apply polymer water shut off from sensitivity analysis of water breakthrough time and cumulative oil production to different reservoir parameters, which are thief zone Kv/Kh ratio, thief zone porosity, mobility ratio, and density difference between oil and water.", "Daftar File": {"2013 TA PP ANGGITA VANIA HUTABARAT 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/109051"}, "Penulis": "ANGGITA VANIA HUTABARAT (NIM : 12209086)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Ir.
