{"Nomor": 29347, "Judul": "SATRAIN ANALYSIS OF GUNTUR VOLCANO, WEST JAVA, FROM GPS OBSERVATIONS IN 2014-2016", "Abstrak": "The purposes of this research is analysing time series of GPS observation points to estimate displacement and strains analysis of GPS station alongside with its relation to the activity of Guntur Volcano. Data used in this research are GPS observation data from 2014-2016. Those data are processed in order to obtain its coordinates. Moreover, the GPS observation points are referenced to CGPS BIG in order to remove the effect of Sundaland block motion. The result will be used to calculate displacement. The displacement will be plotted as vector and strain was calculated based on the displacement value . Based on the results, topocentric coordinates of GPS observation points derived from data processing have standard deviation around 4 mm. In addition, the nrms are checked to determine the quality of data processing which is below 0.5 and around 0.2. These precise results are important in order to deliver better results of displacement and strain. The displacement of CTSG, MSGT and SODN, which are located in the body of Guntur volcano, are moving away from the body of volcano. Meanwhile, the displacement of POST, which is located in monitoring base of Guntur volcano, is moving towards west. The body of volcano and the area outside the body of Guntur volcano experienced extention due to the displacement and volcanic activity of the volcano.", "Daftar File": {"TA PP MUHAMMAD SENNA MALIK 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/136014", "2017 TA PP MUHAMMAD SENNA MALIK 1-CHAPTER 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/136015", "2017 TA PP MUHAMMAD SENNA MALIK 1-CHAPTER 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/136016", "2017 TA PP MUHAMMAD SENNA MALIK 1-CHAPTER 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/136017", "2017 TA PP MUHAMMAD SENNA MALIK 1-CHAPTER 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/136018", "TA PP MUHAMMAD SENNA MALIK 1-REFERENCES.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/136019"}, "Penulis": "MUHAMMAD SENNA MALIK (NIM : 15113073)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Supervisor : \n\nDr. Irwan Meilano, S.T., M.Sc.", "Yoga Era Pamitro, S.T., M.Si."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Guntur volcano, GPS, Displacement, Strain", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Alice D", "File": "6 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Sep 2018"}
