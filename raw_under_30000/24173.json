{"Nomor": 24173, "Judul": "INFLOW PERFORMANCE RELATIONSHIPS (IPR) FOR MULTILAYER WELLS", "Abstrak": "The prime aim of oil and gas industry, during reservoir exploration is knowing the \n\nperformance of wells. A method for calculating well performance is critical for achieving \n\nthis aim. The Inflow Performance Relationship (IPR) describes the behavior of the well\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s \n\nflowing pressure and production rate, which is assumed to be proportional. In addition, \n\nthe knowledge of Inflow Performance Relationship will provide essential information for \n\nwell performance evaluation and optimization. Therefore, this study aims at establishing \n\na technique for calculating the total composite inflow performance relationship (IPR) for \n\nmulti-layer wells. For single phase oil flow, production rate is directly proportional to \n\npressure drawdown and therefore the IPR curve is a straight line. Several empirical \n\nrelations have been proposed in the literature to predict the performance of oil wells \n\nproducing with two layers flow conditions. However, these relationships are empirical \n\nand limited in application. \n\nThe use of Vogel\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s model for computation of IPR curve has been widely used. Therefore, \n\nin this study, Vogel\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s model is employed to determine the inflow performance \n\nrelationship of every layer of well. Well data are sythesized with descretion within \n\nreasonable well conditions constituting bottom hole pressure, as well as maximum flow \n\nrate.Sensitivity analysis was also conducted for optimum tubing diameter. Thereafter, \n\nthose parameters were computed to generat drawdown and flowrate data,with which IPR \n\ncurves were plotted using excel. The results show high consistency with vogel\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s model.", "Daftar File": {"2017 TS PP  SALIH MOHAMMED SALIH ALI  1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/121944"}, "Penulis": "SALIH MOHAMMED SALIH ALI (Student ID: 22215702)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : \n\nIr.
