This system can be divided into two types, namely the empty tubes and tubes with interior stiffeners. One of the tube system with interior stiffener is a tube in tube structure. This system is a combination of the exterior tube and interior tube or so-called central core. The strength of the tube in tube structure system is usually dependent on the number, configuration, and location of the central core. The best location of central core is in the middle of the building. However, the number and configuration of central core that can be applied to a building can be more than one possibility.        \n \n\nIn addition, the high rise buildings that used to use the tube structural system mostly located in Chicago, East America. Based on the world seismic map, the state of Chicago is not the path traversed by the Ring of Fire, so the earthquake vulnerability level is not too high. In other words, it can be concluded that the dominant lateral load which retained by the tall buildings are the wind load. To determine the behavior of the tube structure against earthquake loads, the building should be designed to be in the region of the earthquake vulnerability level is high, one of that is Indonesia.        \n \n\nThere are four model structures with a different central core and column configurations. The period of vibration from all models are same, so it can be done a comparison against the efficiency. The parameters that used to compare is the volume of concrete and reinforcement from beam and column elements which to be used in each model structure. The loading structure made by SNI-03-1727-2010 on Minimum Load for Building Design and Other Structures, and the earthquake resistant structural design based on SNI-03-1726-2012 on Procedures of Restrains Earthquake Planning for Building Structures and Non-Building. After that, the static pushover analysis is done with the help of software ETABS 9.7.2 to determine the sequence of formation and the formation of plastic hinge. And then, the evaluation of the four models is done by the performance based design method.        \n \n\nBased on the results analysis, it can be concluded: (1) From all configurations of existing structures (with periods of vibration are intentionally made to resemble), the model structure which has the smallest of total volume material is the fourth configurations, that has four interior tube with area of each tube at 7,5 m \u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u2014 7,5 m. (2) The more number of beam in a model structure, the more that happens the amount of plastic hinge, so that the ductility value of the structure will increase. (3) All models structure have the actual value of the response modification factor (Ractual) that is greater than the response modification factor design (Rdesign), so that the actual nominal shear force (Vnactual) that occurs is smaller than the nominal design shear force (Vndesign). (4) The first plastic hinge on all configurations of existing structures, was formed in the exterior spandrel beams. This means that the exterior of the tube in tube structure system dominates in absorbing lateral forces. (5) The four models of the existing structure has the same performance level (at the level of immediate occupancy). This indicates that all models structure is less efficient in the planning, because it does not match the performance level they should be (life safety for office buildings). (6) From all models of the existing structure, the fourth configuration is the most efficient model structure. This is because, the displacement current performance point was not much different from the other configurations, although the volume of material required is smaller.", "Daftar File": {"2014 TA PP YUNITHA PUTRI FILOMENA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/124917", "2014 TA PP YUNITHA PUTRI FILOMENA 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/124918", "2014 TA PP YUNITHA PUTRI FILOMENA 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/124919", "2014 TA PP YUNITHA PUTRI FILOMENA 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/124920", "2014 TA PP YUNITHA PUTRI FILOMENA 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/124921", "2014 TA PP YUNITHA PUTRI FILOMENA 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/124922", "2014 TA PP YUNITHA PUTRI FILOMENA 1-BAB 6.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/124923", "2014 TA PP YUNITHA PUTRI FILOMENA 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/124924"}, "Penulis": "YUNITHA PUTRI FILOMENA (NIM : 15010145)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Ir.
