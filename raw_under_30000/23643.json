{"Nomor": 23643, "Judul": "THREE PHASE INFLOW PERFORMANCE RELATIONSHIP CURVE FOR TIGHT OIL RESERVOIR", "Abstrak": "Tight oil reservoir which is included as unconventional oil becomes a focus for serious development today. It has very low permeability and makes people do many efforts for getting the maximum production. Hydraulic fracturing is one of solution to make better productivity of tight oil reservoir. The effect of stimulation will change the Inflow Performance Relationship (IPR) due to the changing of reservoir properties, such as permeability. Therefore, the IPR must be corrected and should account fracturing effects. This study covers the analysis of fracturing, and its effect to the IPR correlation for oil, water and liquid phase.    \n \n \n \n\nThis study focuses on the development of 3D, heterogeneous model, and applying hydraulic fracturing design. One of simulator that can provide this phenomenon is CMG. That is why in this study will use CMG as a reservoir simulator. The simulator is used to build a numerical reservoir model and then develop the IPR correlation.    \n \n \n \n\nProposed model accommodates fluid and rock properties from many tight oil reservoirs. With the function of wellbore flowing pressure for certain rate, IPR for three phase tight oil reservoir were built. First, sensitivity analysis against reservoir heterogeneity and fluid properties were performed to observe the effect of each property related to the IPR. Heterogeneity did not give any impact to dimensionless IPR for tight oil reservoir. On the contrary, effect of fluid properties can increase AOF and ascend the IPR curve. From production test data using CMG, it is noted that the hydraulic fracturing affected to the production of tight oil reservoir, IPR needs new improvement to accommodate it. Finally, from production test evaluation, will be introduced the new dimensionless three phase IPR correlation for non fractured and fractured tight oil reservoir.", "Daftar File": {"2014 TS PP OSALIANA BUDIARTO 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/119626", "2014 TS PP OSALIANA BUDIARTO 1-DAFTAR PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/119632"}, "Penulis": "OSALIANA BUDIARTO (NIM : 22212072)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Prof. Ir.
