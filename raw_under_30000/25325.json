{"Nomor": 25325, "Judul": "DEFORMATION STUDY OF ANAK KRAKATAU VOLCANO BY INSAR METHOD", "Abstrak": "Deformation study of volcano activity is one primary aspect in geodynamic monitoring in Earth. This study is located in Anak Krakatau Volcano where once it was a volcano known as Krakatau Volcano. That volcano erupted in 1883 was categorized as eruption scale 6 of 9 according to Volcanic Explositivity Index. \n\nAnak Krakatau born from the caldera of Krakatau eruption. It actives for a decade and its significant activity is in the period 2006-2011. It was monitored by SAR satellite, ALOS-1 which is built and launched by JAXA (Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency). ALOS-1 uses L-band radar. It transmits the electromagnetic wave to earth terrain and generates a raw radar image. The radar image contains phases data and amplitude data which is represented as complex number. Therefore, the generation of inteferogram image from two radar images is solved by complex conjugate cross-multiplying. Inteferogram image contains the total phases of earth phenomena include deformation phases. The deformation of Anak Krakatau is estimated by Differential InSAR with two-pass method. It requires Digital Elevation model to build a synthetic inteferogram for vertical reference purpose. \n\nAnak Krakatau Volcano shows deformation through five years\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019 observation (2006-2011). It is shown by inteferogram images which shows variety of deformation model along observation years. InSAR has a capability to observe a whole island of Anak Krakatau Volcano. This deformation is followed by seismic activity of Deep Volcanic Earthquake (DVE), Shallow Volcanic Earthquake (SVE), Local Tectonic Earthquake (LTE), and Far Tectonic Earthquake (FTE). DVE and SVE are mostly affects Anak Krakatau Volcano where SVE is more dominant than DVE. \n\nInSAR measurement is good enough to measure the deformation of Anak Krakatau. It is quantified by estimated the coherence value in each pixel of Anak Krakatau Volcano. There are more than 60% pixels cover the observation area.", "Daftar File": {"2016 TA PP ALEXANDER DANIEL PRATAMA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/126241", "2016 TA PP ALEXANDER DANIEL PRATAMA 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/126242", "2016 TA PP ALEXANDER DANIEL PRATAMA 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/126243", "2016 TA PP ALEXANDER DANIEL PRATAMA 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/126244", "2016 TA PP ALEXANDER DANIEL PRATAMA 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/126245", "2016 TA PP ALEXANDER DANIEL PRATAMA 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/126246"}, "Penulis": "ALEXANDER DANIEL PRATAMA  (NIM : 15112031)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Tim Pembimbing :  \n\nDr. Ir.
