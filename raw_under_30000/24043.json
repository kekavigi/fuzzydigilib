This results in more work to be done to manage more than one system at a time. For that we need a method to facilitate the management with many standards. The integrated management system enables us to streamline the way or method of an organization operates, aligns all the usual standard requirements and cuts audit and administrative costs versus when it runs independently. Therefore its implementation can have a substantial impact on how to manage organizations with many standards. The selection of appropriate integration methods will enhance the success of the process of integrating management system standards. The method adopted in this study is the adoption of AZ / NZS 4581: 1999 which combines all general and administrative requirements by looking at process linkages and analyzing the suitability of clauses and forming new clauses that will represent the content of integrated clauses. The purpose of this research is to produce the formulation of integration steps, and model of management system design based on ISO / IEC 17065, ISO / IEC 17024 and ISO / IEC 17025 standards. Implementation of the design is applied in BBLM which applies many standards together. Case studies are conducted by designing integrated quality manuals and integrating internal audit activities, external audits and management reviews. The results of this study are expected to be applied by companies that implement many standards simultaneously in order to implement the management system standards become more effective and efficient.", "Daftar File": {"2017 TS PP Rita Normalia 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/121416"}, "Penulis": "RITA NORMALIA - NIM: 23415060", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
