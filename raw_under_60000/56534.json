{"Nomor": 56534, "Judul": "DETERMINATION OF DESIGN FOR TETRAMERIZATION OF DIMERIC MANGANESE SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE FROM STAPHYLOCOCCUS EQUORUM USING IN-SILICO APPROACH", "Abstrak": "The recombinant manganese superoxide dismutase from Staphylococcus equorum (rMnSODSeq)\nhas been modified to improve its stability for use as a therapeutic agent. The enzyme activity\ndepends on the stability of its dimeric form and higher oligomeric form appears to improve the\nenzyme stability. This research was aimed to find the protein design for tetramerization of\nrMnSODSeq. Naturally occurring tetrameric SODs from Mn/FeSOD family were used as candidates\nfor the structural references and were considered as eligible reference based on their structural\nsimilarity with rMnSODSeq and thermostability. The result showed that tetrameric human\nmitochondrial MnSOD (MnSODH) and bacterial MnSOD from Thermus thermophilus (MnSODThe)\nare the best candidates. These two are distinctive due to differences in their monomer structure\nconformation and therefore produce two distinctive tetrameric configurations. The design based\non the MnSODH configuration required modification involving the stretch Leu39-Gln68 in\nrMnSODSeq to introduce a hairpin structure mimicking the structure of MnSODH that involves in\ntetramerization. On the other hand, the design based on the MnSODThe configuration required\nless modification that includes Asp61Ala, Asn134Ala, Asp135Leu, and Lys154Leu to prevent\nclashes and create hydrophobic environment in the tetrameric interface.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Abykhair Muhammad": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/228348"}, "Penulis": "Abykhair Muhammad [10717208]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. apt.
