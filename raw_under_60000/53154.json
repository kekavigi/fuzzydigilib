{"Nomor": 53154, "Judul": "FAST AUTOMATIC STEP SIZE ESTIMATION FOR GRADIENT DESCENT OPTIMIZATION OF IMAGE REGISTRATION", "Abstrak": "Fast automatic image registration is an important\nprerequisite for image-guided clinical procedures. However, due\nto the large number of voxels in an image and the complexity of\nregistration algorithms, this process is often very slow. Stochastic\ngradient descent is a powerful method to iteratively solve the registration\nproblem, but relies for convergence on a proper selection\nof the optimization step size. This selection is difficult to perform\nmanually, since it depends on the input data, similarity measure\nand transformation model. The Adaptive Stochastic Gradient\nDescent (ASGD) method is an automatic approach, but it comes\nat a high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a new\ncomputationally efficient method (fast ASGD) to automatically\ndetermine the step size for gradient descent methods, by considering\nthe observed distribution of the voxel displacements between\niterations. A relation between the step size and the expectation\nand variance of the observed distribution is derived. While ASGD\nhas quadratic complexity with respect to the transformation\nparameters, fast ASGD only has linear complexity. Extensive\nvalidation has been performed on different datasets with different\nmodalities, inter/intra subjects, different similarity measures and\ntransformation models. For all experiments, we obtained similar\naccuracy as ASGD. Moreover, the estimation time of fast ASGD is\nreduced to a very small value, from 40 s to less than 1 s when the\nnumber of parameters is 105, almost 40 times faster. Depending\non the registration settings, the total registration time is reduced\nby a factor of 2.5\u20137 for the experiments in this paper.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yuchuan Qiao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Baldur van Lew, Boudewijn P.
