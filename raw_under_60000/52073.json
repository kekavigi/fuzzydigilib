{"Nomor": 52073, "Judul": "LONGITUDINAL AUTO PILOT DESIGN OF MALE UAV USING LINEAR QUADRATIC REGULATOR", "Abstrak": "Unmanned Aircraft Vehicle (UAV) are controlled remotely, hence the operator\nshould rely on an autopilot system to maintain aircraft flight condition and attitude.\nIn this study a design of longitudinal autopilot for Medium-Altitude Long-\nEndurance (MALE) UAV is discussed, specifically to control speed and altitude of\nthe aircraft. The work starts by linearising a given nonlinear model of the aircraft.\nAn autopilot controller based on linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is developed for\nthe linear aircraft model. The selection of the weighting matrices in the controller\ndesign is performed automatically (randomise) to minimise Root Mean Square\nError (RMSE) between the reference signal and aircraft response. Further, the\ncontroller is improved with the addition of integral action to remove the steady state\nerror. The robustness of the controller is then evaluated for additional unmodelled\nactuator and sensor dynamics as well as dynamic changes for different trim speed.\nThe design controller results without integral action; speed hold and altitude hold a\nRMSE of 25% and 32%. Meanwhile, final controller design with integral action;\nspeed hold and altitude hold a RMSE of 16% and 11%. The controller can handle\nsensor delay better than actuator delay.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Ahda Nafi' Kurrochman": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/218718"}, "Penulis": "Ahda Nafi' Kurrochman [13616117]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ony Arifianto Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "LQR, Longitudinal Autopilot, Speed Hold, Altitude Hold", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Jan 2021"}
