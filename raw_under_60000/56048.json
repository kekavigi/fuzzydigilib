{"Nomor": 56048, "Judul": "APPLICATION OF FLOW PATTERN MAP (FPM) FOR SOLVING LIQUID LOADING PROBLEMS IN WELL AA", "Abstrak": "About two-thirds of well which exist in the world right now classified as a mature well. Mature well usually have\na lot of problems that occurred during production. Mature well are classified as a well which produced as much\nas fifty percent or be produced for more than twenty-five years. Empowerment of mature well can be increasing\nthe efficiency of well productivity.\nDecreasing of productivity are caused by low maintenance of flow pattern in a well. The other problems which\ncommonly happened is decreasing of reservoir pressure of a well, liquid loading, slugging, and highly water cut\npercentage. A lot of production can be used to solve a lot of problems in mature well. This method can increase\nthe productivity from this well and trying to applied by writer to get the optimal result for well productivity.\nIn this study, shows that well AA have a slug flow pattern using flow pattern diagram as a model matching. Gas\ninjection and velocity string are applied to solve the problems for well AA. Obtained about 12 MMSCFD with\ngas injection method to get annular flow pattern and used 3 different size of velocity string which is 1.25 in, 1.5\nin, dan 2.0625 in with churn flow pattern. In well AA, identified that the use of velocity string is the optimum\nmethod considerate by well AA history.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Johanes Marcel Susilo": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/227490"}, "Penulis": "Johanes Marcel Susilo [12217002]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wijoyo Niti Daton, S.T., M.T.", "Steven Chandra, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Liquid Loading, Flow Pattern Map, Gas Injection, Velocity string", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Jun 2021"}
