{"Nomor": 54068, "Judul": "AUTOMATIC FLIGHT COLLISION AVOIDANCE ON UCAV", "Abstrak": "Airborne collision avoidance has been used by numerous aircraft as a collision alert\nand manual pilot commands. This research focuses on developing a collisionavoidance\nsystem that will focus on a non-cooperative approach, where only one of\nthe aircraft performs the avoidance while the other interferes. The aircraft and the\ncollision avoidance algorithm modeling are carried out using MATLAB and\nSimulink, with aircraft motion simulated in real-time. In this research, the UCAV\nmodel is a fighter-type aircraft that is modeled using a series of data to form a\nlinearized model. The initial linearized data tend to be unstable; hence the stability\nis ensured to comply with the standard. Three autopilot modules involved: the bank\nhold, the heading hold, and the collision avoidance algorithm, with gains tuned\nusing PID block. Two collision cases are modeled: slow-paced statics obstacle\navoidance and then extended to the dynamic obstacle a fast-paced to simulate\naircraft before it collides. Collision points are determined using the sense-detectavoid\nprinciple with the predicted collision point determined by a velocity ratio and\na triangular geometry. The non-cooperative aircraft collision avoidance system has\nbeen simulated and able to avoid an obstacle, with different collision scenarios,\nnamely the slower parallel aircraft, at the perpendicular, acute angle, and obtuse\nangle. The aircraft performing shall avoid the interfering airborne objects at very\nfast-paced, to show that the algorithm passed the design.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Ahmad Faris Shahab": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/222034"}, "Penulis": "Ahmad Faris Shahab [13616106]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Rianto Adhy Sasongko, S.T., M.Sc., Ph.D.", "Seno Sahisnu Rawikara, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "automatic aircraft collision avoidance, control, flight control system, flight dynamics.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Mar 2021"}
