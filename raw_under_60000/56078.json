{"Nomor": 56078, "Judul": "TUBING STRENGTH EVALUATION AND FAILURE ASSESSMENT FOR REACTIVATION OF WELL X USING STEAM FLOODING", "Abstrak": "Many old oil wells still exist in Indonesia, some of those wells has been shut in due to several reasons, two of those reasons are: the oil production that declines significantly and weak well integrity so that the well can not withstand obstructions that occur during production. To maintain and boost Indonesia\u2019s oil production, Enhanced Oil Recover (EOR) methods can be applied in mature fields. One of EOR methods that has the most extensive application is steam flooding. Steam flooding is one of EOR methods which the fluid is injected continuously to drive the oil from injector to producer.. This EOR method is a successful method to increase heavy-oil production.\nReactivation of old well into steam flooding well is an excellent way to improve old well performance and also to escalate oil production in mature field. However, the application of steam flooding deals with well integrity problem. Steam flooding well has a very high risk of casing and tubing failure that caused by the loads from burst, collapse, tension, and thermal effect due to the high temperature steam that can decrease the rating of casing or tubing. Hence, this study focuses on evaluating tubing\u2019s strength on the existing well whether the tubing is applicable for steam flooding or must be replaced.\nIn this study, a tubing strength evaluation of well X using steam flooding method will be discussed. Tubing strength evaluation consists of two stage. The first stage is evaluation due to burst, collapse, and tension loads and the other stage is evaluation due to thermal effects of injected steam. Well X has K-55 tubing with 3.5 inch OD, burst rating of 7,947.5 psi, collapse rating of 7,052.9 psi, and tension rating of 160,262 lbf. Based on the evaluation result, this existing K-55 tubing still be able to withstand the loads from burst, collapse, tension, and thermal effects. Hence, the reactivation of Well X using steam flooding can be done without replacing or upgrading the tubing.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Muhammad Hafidz Setiawan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/227530", "2021 TA PP MUHAMMAD HAFIDZ SETIAWAN 1.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/228803"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Hafidz Setiawan [12217032]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wijoyo Niti Daton, S.T., M.T.", "Steven Chandra, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Thermal effect, steam flooding, EOR, tubing strength, tubing failure", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Jun 2021"}
