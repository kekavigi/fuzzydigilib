{"Nomor": 54770, "Judul": "HYDRAULIC FRACTURE MODELING OF HORIZONTAL WELL IN SHALE GAS FORMATION", "Abstrak": "Shale gas reservoir is a reservoir which has a low permeability compared to other reservoirs. This makes the gas is not able to flow easily from the reservoir to the wellbore. Because of it, the gas production in shale gas reservoirs is not profitable if done in a conventional manner.\nIn this day, there are so many technologies and new methods have been found in dealing with problems in shale gas reservoirs, such as directional drilling, horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is one of the well stimulation methods which is good enough for low-permeability reservoir problem, because this method is able to create fractures that increase the value of matirx permeability significantly so that the gas production will increased. This also happened with horizontal wells, because this method can improve the drainage area to be greater than vertical wells. In case of increasing the production economicaly and efficiently, it appears the combination of both methods, named hydraulic fracturing on horizontal wells. This study will evaluate the improvement of gas production in shale gas reservoirs by using hydraulic fracturing in horizontal well in different case, longitudinal fracture and transversal fracture. This study will show a comparison that could indicate which fracture method could give the greater gas production incremental.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Brestoff Alexandre Siregar": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/224636"}, "Penulis": "Brestoff Alexandre Siregar [12210069]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
