{"Nomor": 54590, "Judul": "CLASSIFICATION OF MEDICAL IMAGES IN THE BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE BY JOINTLY USING DEEP AND HANDCRAFTED VISUAL FEATURES", "Abstrak": "The classification of medical images and illustrations\nfrom the biomedical literature is important for automated\nliterature review, retrieval, andmining. Although deep\nlearning is effective for large-scale image classification, it\nmay not be the optimal choice for this task as there is only\na small training dataset. We propose a combined deep and\nhandcrafted visual feature (CDHVF) based algorithm that\nuses features learned by three fine-tuned and pretrained\ndeep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and two handcrafted\ndescriptors in a joint approach. We evaluated the\nCDHVF algorithm on the ImageCLEF 2016 Subfigure Classification\ndataset and it achieved an accuracy of 85.47%,\nwhich is higher than the best performance of other purely\nvisual approaches listed in the challenge leaderboard. Our\nresults indicate that handcrafted features complement the\nimage representation learned by DCNNs on small training\ndatasets and improve accuracy in certain medical image\nclassification problems.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jianpeng Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yong Xia, Yutong Xie, Michael Fulham, and David Dagan Feng"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Medical image classification, deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), back-propagation neural network (BPNN), ensemble learning.", "Sumber": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "05 Apr 2021"}
