{"Nomor": 51396, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT OF A ONE AXIS THRUST VECTORING CONTROL SYSTEM DEMONSTRATOR WITH ELECTRIC DUCTED FAN", "Abstrak": "In this 21st century, space explorations are now joined by private companies, such\nas SpaceX, which not only focused in conducting the space mission, but also to do\nit economically. Therefore, many reusable launcher vehicles (LVs) is being\ndeveloped, which requires sophisticated control system to support its high-level\nmaneuvers, such as the flip-over maneuver. Thrust Vectoring Control (TVC)\nbecomes a solution for such control, since it has faster responses and it is robust to\nthe flight environment, compared to conventional aerodynamic control. As the\ndevelopment of this technology takes a lot of experiments and may cost a lot,\nhardware in the loop simulator, or a demonstrator, can help in the learning and the\ndevelopment process.\nThis research purpose is to design and build an indoor TVC demonstrator, using\nElectric Ducted Fan (EDF) as the thruster, that is capable of simulating the thrust\ncontrol of a flight vehicle with high maneuverability, such as an LV. The system is\nlimited with only one degree of freedom, the pitch rotational axis, to be focused\nmore on the demonstrator hardware and control requirements. The research is done\nby doing a literature study, designing, manufacturing, and conducting several\nexperiments of the system stabilization by measuring the deviation angle based on\nthe thrust input. To simulate any instability, the system\u2019s center of gravity (CG) is\nshifted 1.66 cm from the rotation axis, and hence provide a constant disturbance. A\nFlight Controller (FC) is used as the control mechanisms to stabilize pitch attitude.\nThe demonstrator is then built and tested, and capable to stabilize itself to a certain\nextent using PID control algorithm. The demonstrator performs well in stabilizing\nthe pitch, achievable with at least 50% of Thrust. Several steady state oscillations,\nhowever, are observed possibly due to the air recirculation and the CG offset. This\nresult indicates the need to improve the hardware design. Nevertheless, the\ndemonstrator provides a descent foundation for future research of TVC.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Naufal Muhammad Farras [13616104]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Yazdi Ibrahim Jenie, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Control, EDF, Hardware-in-the-loop, Launch Vehicle, TVC", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Sep 2020"}
