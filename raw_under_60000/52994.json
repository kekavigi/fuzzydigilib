{"Nomor": 52994, "Judul": "COVID-19 INFECTION: ORIGIN, TRANSMISSION, AND CHARACTERISTICS OF HUMAN CORONAVIRUSES", "Abstrak": "The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a highly transmittable and pathogenic viral infection caused by\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which emerged in Wuhan, China and\nspread around the world. Genomic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is phylogenetically related to severeacute respiratory syndrome-like (SARS-like) bat viruses, therefore bats could be the possible primaryreservoir. The intermediate source of origin and transfer to humans is not known, however, the rapidhuman to human transfer has been confirmed widely. There is no clinically approved antiviral drug orvaccine available to be used against COVID-19. However, few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs have beenevaluated against COVID-19 in clinical trials, resulted in clinical recovery. In the current review, we summarizeand comparatively analyze the emergence and pathogenicity of COVID-19 infection and previoushuman coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratorysyndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). We also discuss the approaches for developing effective vaccinesand therapeutic combinations to cope with this viral outbreak.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Adnan Shereen [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Suliman Khan, Abeer Kazmi, Nadia Bashir, Rabeea Siddique."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Coron viruses, COVID-19, Origin, Outbreak, Spread.", "Sumber": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2090123220300540", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Feb 2021"}
