{"Nomor": 57848, "Judul": "IMPROVING ENERGY TRANSITION IN INDONESIAN INDUSTRIAL SECTOR THROUGH  POLICY TRANSFER APPROACH", "Abstrak": "The industrial sector is one of the largest energy consumers in Indonesia. Thus, it\nis important to manage the industry\u2019s energy system towards low carbon sources to\naccelerate the energy transition process. Since Indonesia\u2019s industrial development\nplan is still largely dependent on fossil fuels, existing policies are considered\ninsufficient to handle the energy transition challenges. Policy learning from other\ncountries with significant experience in this domain may help Indonesia improve\nthe transition process through policy transfer. This study aims to provide policy\nrecommendations that could improve energy transition in the industrial sector in\nIndonesia by identifying barriers and enabling factors in the transition process. In\ndoing so, a policy analysis was performed from official policy documents, while\nempirical data to strengthen the findings was gathered through 8 semi-structured\ninterviews with policymakers and industrial practitioners from Indonesia and the\nUnited Kingdom. Findings demonstrate that policy transfer helps search for the\npotential of policy improvement in the industry\u2019s energy transition. Accordingly,\nthe study focuses on how the policy transfer process could benefit energy transition\nin Indonesia\u2019s industrial sector by exploring examples with policy transfer potential\nfrom the UK's energy policy. The results reveal some barriers related to the policy\ntransfer implementation, prominently the financial barrier. Some recommendations\nfor policymakers on how to deal with those barriers are suggested in conclusion.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Yuli Puspita Sari": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/231456", "BAB 1 Yuli Puspita Sari": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/231766", "BAB 2 Yuli Puspita Sari": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/231767", "BAB 3 Yuli Puspita Sari": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/231768", "BAB 4 Yuli Puspita Sari": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/231769", "BAB 5 Yuli Puspita Sari": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/231770", "BAB 6 Yuli Puspita Sari": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/231771", "PUSTAKA Yuli Puspita Sari": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/231772", "2021 TS PP YULI PUSPITA SARI_LAMPIRAN.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/231773"}, "Penulis": "Yuli Puspita Sari [25419034]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
