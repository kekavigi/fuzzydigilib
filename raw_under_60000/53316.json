{"Nomor": 53316, "Judul": "APPLICATION OF THE 4-D XCAT PHANTOMS IN BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND BEYOND", "Abstrak": "The four-dimensional (4-D) eXtended CArdiac-\nTorso (XCAT) series of phantoms was developed to provide\naccurate computerized models of the human anatomy and\nphysiology. The XCAT series encompasses a vast population\nof phantoms of varying ages from newborn to adult,\neach including parameterized models for the cardiac and\nrespiratory motions. With great flexibility in the XCAT\u2019s\ndesign, any number of body sizes, different anatomies,\ncardiac or respiratorymotions or patterns, patient positions\nand orientations, and spatial resolutions can be simulated.\nAs such, the XCAT phantoms are gaining a wide use in\nbiomedical imaging research. There they can provide a virtual\npatient base from which to quantitatively evaluate and\nimprove imaging instrumentation, data acquisition, techniques,\nand image reconstruction and processingmethods\nwhich can lead to improvedimage quality andmore accurate\nclinical diagnoses. The phantoms have also found great\nuse in radiation dosimetry, radiation therapy,medical device\ndesign, and even the security and defense industry. This\nreview paper highlights some specific areas in which the\nXCAT phantoms have found use within biomedical imaging\nand other fields. From these examples, we illustrate the\nincreasingly important role that computerized phantoms\nand computer simulation are playing in the research community.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "W.
