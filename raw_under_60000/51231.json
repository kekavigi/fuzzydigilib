{"Nomor": 51231, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT OF SPLIT-HOPKINSON SHEAR BAR FIXTURE FOR PUNCH AND DOUBLE- NOTCH TECHNIQUES", "Abstrak": "In the field of advance mechanical engineering, a need for better understanding of material properties in impact loading conditions become inevitable. That is why the development of material testing apparatus, designed to attain material properties in impact loading conditions, become necessary.\nSplit-Hopkinson shear bar (SHSB) is a device used to acquire material responses under impact shearing load. Beside a modification in a specimen geometry, a hollow transmission bar is also needed for punch and double-notch technique. In this research, Author tries to design a fixture so that SHSB punch and double-notch can be conducted with a conventional solid transmission bar.\nFinite element analysis will be conducted to study the effect of installing a fixture to the apparatus. The finite element analysis will then be validated experimentally and theoretically. The apparatus used for the study is based on the apparatus located in Swiburne University of Technology while the material selected for the specimen is 6061-T651 Aluminum.\nThis research concluded that: (a) the main design parameters for punch fixture are the total mass of fixture-transmission bar system and the fixture-transmission bar diameter ratio, (b) a further modification of SHSB punch apparatus is required in order for the fixture to work properly, (c) the main design parameters for double-notch fixture are the length of the fixture and the transmission wall diameter, (d) the proposed double-notch fixture design is DN3.6.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Arya Dipajaya Nugraha [13116132]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["M.
