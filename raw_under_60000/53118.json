In this\npaper, 4-D vector flow imaging for intracardiac flow assessment\nis demonstrated using a clinical ultrasound (US)\nsystem and a matrix array transducer, without the use of\ncontrast agent. Two acquisition schemes were developed,\none for full volumetric coverage of the left ventricle (LA) at\n50 vps and a 3-D thick-slice setup with continuous frame\nacquisition (4000 vps), both utilizing ECG-gating. The\n3-D vector velocity estimates were obtained using a novel\nmethod combining phase and envelope information. In vitro\nvalidation in a rotating tissue-mimicking phantom revealed\nvelocity estimates in compliance with the ground truth,\nwith a linear regression slope of 0.80, 0.77, and 1.03 for the\nx, y, and z velocity components, and with standard\ndeviations of 2.53, 3.19, and 0.95 cm/s, respectively. In vivo\nmeasurements in a healthy LV showed good agreement\nwith PC-MRI. Quantitative analysis of energy loss (EL) and\nkinetic energy (KE) further showed similar trends, with\npeak KE at 1.5 and 2.4 mJ during systole and 3.6 and 3.1 mJ\nfor diastole for US and PC-MRI. Similar for EL, 0.15\u20130.2 and\n0.7 mW was found during systole and 0.6 and 0.7 mW\nduring diastole, for US and PC-MRI, respectively. Overall,\na potential for US as a future modality for 4D cardiac vector\nflow imaging was demonstrated, which will be further\nevaluated in clinical studies.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Morten Smedsrud Wigen [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Solveig Fadnes , Alfonso Rodriguez-Molares , Tore Bj\u00e5stad , Marius Eriksen, Knut Haakon Stens\u00e6th, Asbj\u00f8rn St\u00f8ylen, and Lasse Lovstakken"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Blood flow imaging, intracardiac flow imaging, plane wave imaging, vector flow imaging, 4D ultrasound.", "Sumber": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Feb 2021"}
