{"Nomor": 56058, "Judul": "A NEW PROPOSED MODIFIED ALI MODEL FOR PRODUCTION FORECASTING IN CONVENTIONAL RESERVOIRS", "Abstrak": "The Arps Model is only applicable for boundary-dominated flow regimes in conventional reservoirs. However, sometimes an anomaly occurs in using the Arps Model, which results in a value of b which is greater than unity. This could be caused by several problems, such as that the boundary-dominated flow regime has not been reached yet and layered reservoirs. This anomaly will cause errors in analyzing the production rate profile. However, in this study, it was found that there was an anomaly in the value of b when using the Arps Model. But on the other hand, the model was quite accurate in matching the trend of the production rate. Therefore, in this study, the Modified Ali Model is proposed to analyze the production rate profile without considering the flow regime. And this model will produce an accurate estimate as long as the trend of the analyzed production rate is declining and is produced at a constant flowing pressure. This model is specialized to the case of a conventional reservoir.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Jefta Pratama Purba": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/227500", "2021 TA PP  JEFTA PRATAMA PURBA 1.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/228809"}, "Penulis": "Jefta Pratama Purba [12217014]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Amega Yasutra, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Modified Ali Model, Boundary-dominated Flow Regime, Conventional Reservoirs", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Jun 2021"}
