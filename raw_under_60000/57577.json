However, when compared to the needs of tilapia, its production is not sufficient for its needs. Thus, efforts are needed to increase production, but there are many limitations in a business. One of them is tilapia cultivation in Cibunar Village, Sumedang Regency, which has to face several obstacles: the low skill level of fish entrepreneurs, low production efficiency levels, long value chains, business feasibility not yet known by cultivators, and the role of institutions that have not been running effectively. Therefore, a sustainable strategy is needed to assist tilapia farmers in dealing with all limitations and changes in the business environment by strengthening the role of institutions.
