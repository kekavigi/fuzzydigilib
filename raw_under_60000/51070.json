{"Nomor": 51070, "Judul": "A CLUSTER-BASED METHOD FOR IMPROVING WATER DEPTH ESTIMATION FROM SATELLITE DERIVED BATHYMETRY", "Abstrak": "Several basic inversion algorithms have been proposed to estimate water depth from optical remote sensing imagery. According to the previous study, the accuracy approximately measures in 2 m for depth up to 10 m by means of the Global Bathymetric Inversion Method. In this presented research, an effort to improve the accuracy of the bathymetric model derived from optical satellite imagery is discussed. The improvement is done based on the so-called Cluster-Based Method applied to the analytical and log-ratio methods. The Cluster-Based Method partitions the working area by classifying the error between the known depth and the predicted one. The data for the known and predicted depths are acquired from the in-situ survey and the Sentinel-2 imagery. By using the Cluster-Based Method, the accuracy improved to 1.26 m for the cluster-based using analytical method and 1.32 m for the log-ratio method up to 15 m depth.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Litany Meliala": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214024"}, "Penulis": "Litany Meliala [25119007]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Poerbandono, S.T., M.M.", "Teguh Purnama Sidiq, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Geodesi dan Geomatika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Ilmu dan Teknologi Kebumian", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Satellite, Bathymetry, Analytical-Method, Log-Ratio Method, Cluster-Based Method.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Sep 2020"}
