{"Nomor": 54579, "Judul": "LEARNING JOINT-SPARSE CODES FOR CALIBRATION-FREE PARALLEL MR IMAGING", "Abstrak": "The integration of compressed sensing and\nparallel imaging (CS-PI) has shown an increased popularity\nin recent years to accelerate magnetic resonance (MR)\nimaging. Among them, calibration-free techniques have\npresented encouraging performances due to its capability\nin robustly handling the sensitivity information. Unfortunately,\nexisting calibration-freemethods have only explored\njoint-sparsity with direct analysis transform projections.\nTo further exploit joint-sparsity and improve reconstruction\naccuracy, this paper proposes to Learn joINt-sparse coDes\nfor caliBration-free parallEl mR imaGing (LINDBERG) by\nmodeling the parallel MR imaging problem as an 2\u2013F\u20132,1\nminimization objective with an 2 norm constraining data\nfidelity, Frobenius norm enforcing sparse representation\nerror and the 2,1 mixed norm triggering joint sparsity\nacrossmultichannels. A corresponding algorithm has been\ndeveloped to alternatively update the sparse representation,\nsensitivity encoded images and K-space data. Then,\nthe final image is produced as the square root of sum\nof squares of all channel images. Experimental results on\nboth physical phantom and in vivo data sets show that the\nproposedmethod is comparable and even superior to stateof-\nthe-art CS-PI reconstruction approaches. Specifically,\nLINDBERG has presented strong capability in suppressing\nnoise and artifacts while reconstructing MR images from\nhighly undersampled multichannel measurements.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Shanshan Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sha Tan, Yuan Gao, Qiegen Liu, Leslie Ying, Taohui Xiao, Yuanyuan Liu, Xin Liu, Hairong Zheng, and Dong Liang, Senior Member, IEEE"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Parallel imaging, adaptive sparse coding, joint sparsity, MR image reconstruction.", "Sumber": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Apr 2021"}
