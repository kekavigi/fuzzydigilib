{"Nomor": 57788, "Judul": "A PROXY MODEL TO PREDICT OPTIMUM PERFORATION OF CONING PROBLEM IN VERTICAL WELL", "Abstrak": "The need for oil and gas drives the optimization of oil recovery in all reservoirs to the fullest. However, several\nproduction constraints resulted in non-optimal oil production from the reservoir, one of the causes was coning.\nConing is a production problem in which gas cap gas or bottom water infiltrates the perforation zone in the nearwellbore\narea and reduces oil production. Coning is a rate-sensitive phenomenon generally associated with high\nproducing rates. This phenomenon occurs when the pressure forces drawing fluids toward the wellbore overcome\nthe natural buoyancy forces that segregate gas and water from oil.\nThere are several strategies to predict the coning problem in terms of critical oil rate with analytical, empirical,\nand numerical approaches. Generally, a simulation with a numerical approach is used for reservoir modeling. In\naddition, there is an approach with a statistical method through a proxy model which is considered simpler. A\nproxy model is a type of machine learning built on large amounts of experimental data. The proxy model is\nbecoming more widely used because it can simplify very complex processes with reasonable accuracy. The proxy\nmodel is used in the form of a response surface to speed up interpretation and optimization methods. In this study,\nby using a proxy approach to the model, the authors overcome the problem coning by sensitivity to perforation\nand some other effect parameters.\nThe results of this study after testing the case on the validation reservoir with gas and water coning problems, the\nproxy model can predict the optimum perforation length to get the maximum cumulative oil production at water\nbreakthrough quickly and easily with reliable results.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Ahmad Rafly Ahsan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/231331"}, "Penulis": "Ahmad Rafly Ahsan [12217096]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Amega Yasutra, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Coning, Proxy Model, Perforation, Cumulative Oil Production.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Agu 2021"}
