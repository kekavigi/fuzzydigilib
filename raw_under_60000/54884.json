{"Nomor": 54884, "Judul": "SINGLE IMAGE SUPER-RESOLUTION VIA MULTIPLE MIXTURE PRIOR MODELS", "Abstrak": "Example learning-based single image superresolution\n(SR) is a promising method for reconstructing a highresolution\n(HR) image from a single-input low-resolution (LR)\nimage. Lots of popular SR approaches are more likely either timeor\nspace-intensive, which limit their practical applications. Hence,\nsome research has focused on a subspace view and delivered stateof-\nthe-art results. In this paper, we utilize an effective way with\nmixture prior models to transform the large nonlinear feature\nspace of LR images into a group of linear subspaces in the\ntraining phase. In particular, we first partition image patches\ninto several groups by a novel selective patch processing method\nbased on difference curvature of LR patches, and then learning\nthe mixture prior models in each group. Moreover, different prior\ndistributions have various effectiveness in SR, and in this case,\nwe find that student-t prior shows stronger performance than\nthe well-known Gaussian prior. In the testing phase, we adopt\nthe learned multiple mixture prior models to map the input LR\nfeatures into the appropriate subspace, and finally reconstruct\nthe corresponding HR image in a novel mixed matching way.\nExperimental results indicate that the proposed approach is both\nquantitatively and qualitatively superior to some state-of-the-art\nSR methods.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yuanfei Huang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jie Li, Xinbo Gao, Lihuo He, Wen Lu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Student-t mixture models, selective patch processing, difference curvature, mixed matching.", "Sumber": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING, VOL. 27, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2018", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Jun 2021"}
