One of the reasons for this increase is due to an increase in demand for cement, which is the main building block for a building. Carbon dioxide is produced in cement plants from several processes including calcination which breaks down limestone into CaO and carbon dioxide as well as from burning conventional fossil fuels. A minor emission is also caused by material transportation from the supplier.\nOn the other hand, nowadays, hydrogen is studied and developed as a promising secondary fuel. This happens because it can be converted from various sources and also contains a high heating value, although it cannot transmit information like electricity. When applied holistically in an energy ecosystem, hydrogen has a potential equivalent to electricity. The main idea in this study is how to reduce this carbon dioxide emission from the cement plant. One proposed idea is by substituting the fuel from coal to hydrogen which is a carbon-free fuel. Although hydrogen has a higher calorific value than coal, hydrogen energy is rarely applied in the industrial realm due to storage and distribution technology problems. Ammonia is proposed as a solution that solved both of those problem.\nA simulation using Aspen Plus is done by comparing clinker production using hydrogen and coal. Some of the notable results are, a decrease in about 46% percent carbon dioxide emission achieved and ammonia decomposition temperature the variables that most influence plant productivity. However, hydrogen-fueled cement production system yields 28% less productivity compared to the coal-fueled one. In addition, since this proposed system have 24% difference in term of volumetric flowrate, some adjustments such as hybrid combustion is proposed with composition of 53% coal and 47% of hydrogen", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Axl Sabilirasyad Cezeliano": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/212981"}, "Penulis": "Axl Sabilirasyad Cezeliano [13116113]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
