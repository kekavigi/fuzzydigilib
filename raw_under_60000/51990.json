{"Nomor": 51990, "Judul": "EFFECTS OF COMPOUND ADDED WITH CO2 INJECTION IN LOWERING MINIMUM MISCIBILITY PRESSURE AT \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdL\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd FIELD", "Abstrak": "CO2 injection is one of the most promising EOR technique and it is important to conduct the gas injection at\nmiscible condition to reach maximum recovery efficiency. But miscible injection is not applicable in some\nfields in Indonesia due to high temperature that leads to high minimum miscibility pressure (MMP). This high\nvalue of MMP sometimes also exceeds its fracture pressure make it impossible to be conducted.\nThis study focuses on lowering MMP in \u201cL\u201d Field by adding compounds along with CO2. This investigation\nconsiders compounds from five functional groups which are alcohol, amine, ketone, aldehyde and ether with\nrange compound amount of 10%, 20% and 30% mole and the whole simulation to estimate MMP was run using\nWINPROP 2015 by cell to cell method.\nIt is found that the more amount of compound added, the more MMP reduction will be achieved. The most\neffective compound in lowering MMP in \u201cL\u201d field does not only depend on the type of compound, but also the\namount of compound added. At 10% mole, the most effective compound is propylamine which can reduce\nMMP up to 20.15%. Meanwhile at 20% mole of compound, methanol, propylamine and diethyl ether reduce\nMMP up to 31%. Methanol and Propylamine are the best effective compounds at 30% mole that give 42.6%\nMMP reduction.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ovilia Wenas [12214054]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
