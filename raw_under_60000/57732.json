{"Nomor": 57732, "Judul": "QUANTITATIVE RISK ASSESSMENT OF A PIPELINE", "Abstrak": "The statistics of pipeline usage has now recently increased both in urban and rural area. Pipelines have emerged to be the best solve the imbalance demand and supply of natural gases and petroleum. However, pipelines have high risk in operation especially in urban areas. Pipeline failure may result in two forms, toxic and flammable releases. Failure in pipeline may also cause a huge impact to its surroundings, such as loss of lives, property damages and economic losses. Hence, risk assessment is needed to overcome and tackle risks from pipeline failure. Quantitative Risk Assessment is one of the many methods that have been used when assessing risks from pipeline failures.\nRisks from pipeline failure can be categorized into two types of risks which are individual risk and societal risk. Results of risks from this assessment is obtained by the calculation of Probability of Failure and Consequences of Failure. References referred for this assessment is based on PD 8010-3:2009-A1-2013 for Probability of Failure and research papers of Jo and Ahn for the Consequences of Failure calculations. After risks are obtained from the assessment, various risks mitigation methods are recommended to the pipeline. Risk mitigations methods are to lower or eliminate the level of risks present in the pipeline.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Bryan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/231217"}, "Penulis": "Bryan [13117229]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["M.
