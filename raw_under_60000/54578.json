{"Nomor": 54578, "Judul": "ANATOMICAL-FUNCTIONAL IMAGE FUSION BY INFORMATION OF INTEREST IN LOCAL LAPLACIAN FILTERING DOMAIN", "Abstrak": "A novel method for performing anatomical magnetic\nresonance imaging-functional (positron emission tomography\nor single photon emission computed tomography) image\nfusion is presented. The method merges specific feature information\nfrom input image signals of a single or multiple medical\nimaging modalities into a single fused image, while preserving\nmore information and generating less distortion. The proposed\nmethod uses a local Laplacian filtering-based technique realized\nthrough a novel multi-scale system architecture. First, the input\nimages are generated in a multi-scale image representation and\nare processed using local Laplacian filtering. Second, at each\nscale, the decomposed images are combined to produce fused\napproximate images using a local energy maximum scheme\nand produce the fused residual images using an information\nof interest-based scheme. Finally, a fused image is obtained\nusing a reconstruction process that is analogous to that of\nconventional Laplacian pyramid transform. Experimental results\ncomputed using individual multi-scale analysis-based decomposition\nschemes or fusion rules clearly demonstrate the superiority\nof the proposed method through subjective observation as well as\nobjective metrics. Furthermore, the proposed method can obtain\nbetter performance, compared with the state-of-the-art fusion\nmethods.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jiao Du [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Weisheng Li, and Bin Xiao"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Image fusion, multi-scale decomposition, interest-based rule.", "Sumber": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Apr 2021"}
