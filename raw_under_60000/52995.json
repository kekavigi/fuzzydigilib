{"Nomor": 52995, "Judul": "APPARENT ULTRA-HIGH -VALUE DIFFUSION-WEIGHTED IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION VIA HIDDEN CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELDS", "Abstrak": "A promising, recently explored, alternative to\nultra-high -value diffusion weighted imaging (UHB-DWI) is apparent\nultra-high -value diffusion-weighted image reconstruction\n(AUHB-DWR), where a computational model is used to assist in\nthe reconstruction of apparent DW images at ultra-high -values.\nFirstly, we present a novel approach to AUHB-DWR that aims\nto improve image quality. We formulate the reconstruction of an\napparent DW image as a hidden conditional random field (HCRF)\nin which tissue model diffusion parameters act as hidden states in\nthis random field. The second contribution of this paper is a new\ngeneration of fully connected conditional random fields, called the\nhidden stochastically fully connected conditional random fields\n(HSFCRF) that allows for efficient inference with significantly\nreduced computational complexity via stochastic clique structures.\nThe proposed AUHB-DWR algorithms, HCRF and HSFCRF,\nare evaluated quantitatively in nine different patient cases using\nFisher's criteria, probability of error, and coefficient of variation\nmetrics to validate its effectiveness for the purpose of improving\nintensity delineation between expert identified suspected cancerous\nand healthy tissue within the prostate gland. The proposed\nmethods are also examined using a prostate phantom, where the\napparent ultra-high -value DW images reconstructed using the\ntested AUHB-DWR methods are compared with real captured\nUHB-DWI. The results illustrate that the proposed AUHB-DWR\nmethods has improved reconstruction quality and improved intensity\ndelineation compared with existing AUHB-DWR approaches.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mohammad Javad Shafiee [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Shahid A.
