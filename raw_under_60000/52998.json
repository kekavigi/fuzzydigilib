{"Nomor": 52998, "Judul": "IMPROVING OPTOACOUSTIC IMAGE QUALITY VIA GEOMETRIC PIXEL SUPER-RESOLUTION APPROACH", "Abstrak": "High fidelity optoacoustic (photoacoustic) tomography\nrequires dense spatial sampling of optoacoustic signals using\npoint acoustic detectors. However, in practice, spatial resolution\nof the images is often limited by limited sampling either due to\ncoarse multi-element arrays or time in raster scan measurements.\nHerein, we investigate a method that integrates information from\nmultiple optoacoustic images acquired at sub-diffraction steps into\none high resolution image by means of an iterative registration algorithm.\nExperimental validations performed in target phantoms\nand ex vivo tissue samples confirm that the suggested approach\nrenders significant improvements in terms of optoacoustic image\nresolution and quality without introducing significant alterations\ninto the signal acquisition hardware or inversion algorithms.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hailong He [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Graduate Student Member, IEEE, Subhamoy Mandal, Graduate Student Member, IEEE, Andreas Buehler, X.
