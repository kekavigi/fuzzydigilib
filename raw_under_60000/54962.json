{"Nomor": 54962, "Judul": "HIPPOCAMPUS SEGMENTATION BASED ON ITERATIVE LOCAL LINEAR MAPPING WITH REPRESENTATIVE AND LOCAL STRUCTURE-PRESERVED FEATURE EMBEDDING", "Abstrak": "Hippocampus segmentation plays a significant\nrole in mental disease diagnoses, such as Alzheimer\u2019s\ndisease, epilepsy, and so on. Patch-based multi-atlas segmentation\n(PBMAS) approach is a popular method for hippocampus\nsegmentation and has achieved a promising\nresult. However, the PBMAS approach needs high computation\ncost due to registration and the segmentation\naccuracy is subject to the registration accuracy. In this\npaper, we propose a novel method based on iterative local\nlinear mapping (ILLM) with the representative and local\nstructure-preserved feature embedding to achieve accurate\nand robust hippocampus segmentation with no need for\nregistration. In the proposed approach, semi-supervised\ndeep autoencoder (SSDA) exploits unsupervised deep\nautoencoder and local structure-preserved manifold regularization\nto nonlinearly transform the extracted magnetic\nresonance (MR) patch toembedded featuremanifold,whose\nadjacent relationship is similar to the signed distance\nmap (SDM) patch manifold. Local linear mapping is used\nto preliminarily predict SDM patch corresponding to the MR\npatch. Subsequently, threshold segmentation generates a\npreliminary segmentation. The ILLM refines the segmentation\nresult iteratively by ensuring the local constraints of\nembedded feature manifold and SDM patch manifold using\na space-constrained dictionary update. Thus, a refined\nsegmentation is obtained with no need for registration.\nThe experiments on 135 subjects from ADNI dataset show\nthat the proposed approach is superior to the state-of-theart\nPBMAS and classification-based approaches with mean\nDice similarity coefficients of 0.8852 \u00b1 0.0203 and 0.8783 \u00b1\n0.0251 for bilateral hippocampus segmentation of 1.5T and\n3.0T datasets, respectively.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Shumao Pang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zhentai Lu, Jun Jiang, Lei Zhao, Liyan Lin, Xueli Li, Tao Lian , Meiyan Huang, Wei Yang , and Qianjin Feng"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Deep learning, multi-atlas segmentation, iterative local linear mapping, manifold regularization.", "Sumber": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING, VOL. 38, NO. 10, OCTOBER 2019", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Jun 2021"}
