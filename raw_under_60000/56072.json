{"Nomor": 56072, "Judul": "NEW APPROACHES TO DETERMINE HYPERBOLIC DECLINE PARAMETERS BASED ON SPIVEY\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdS METHODS", "Abstrak": "Production forecast of a geothermal reservoir is important since future performance will be used as a basis to determine make-up well requirement and remaining reserve assessment. The prominent method to perform production forecast is the decline curve analysis based on the Arps method. One of the challenges in using the Arps method is determining the hyperbolic exponent value, b, at the type of hyperbolic decline. This paper aimed to offer two new approaches to find a hyperbolic exponent using Spivey\u2019s methods which are based on binomial and Taylor expansion. Spivey\u2019s methods have not been widely used in geothermal production decline analysis, so it is an opportunity to apply them. These new approaches use iteration and matrix operations such as multiplication, transpose, and inverse. Besides the hyperbolic exponent, the initial decline rate and initial flow rate values are also the outcomes of these new approaches. Developed in a Spreadsheet, the calculation becomes more manageable and more practical. These new approaches are recommended to be used in another geothermal field especially when the production data is smoothly declined.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Prasetya Siregar": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/227513"}, "Penulis": "Prasetya Siregar [12217023]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Heru Berian Pratama, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Decline Curve Analysis, Spivey Method, Arps Method, Production Forecast, Hyperbolic Decline Curve.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Jun 2021"}
