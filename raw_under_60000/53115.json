{"Nomor": 53115, "Judul": "SIMILARITY MEASURE-BASED POSSIBILISTIC FCM WITH LABEL INFORMATION FOR BRAIN MRI SEGMENTATION", "Abstrak": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is extensively\napplied in clinical practice. Segmentation of the MRI brain image\nis significant to the detection of brain abnormalities. However,\nowing to the coexistence of intensity inhomogeneity and noise,\ndividing the MRI brain image into different clusters precisely\nhas become an arduous task. In this paper, an improved possibilistic\nfuzzy c-means (FCM) method based on a similarity\nmeasure is proposed to improve the segmentation performance\nfor MRI brain images. By introducing the new similarity measure,\nthe proposed method is more effective for clustering the\ndata with nonspherical distribution. Besides that, the new similarity\nmeasure could alleviate the \u201ccluster-size sensitivity\u201d problem\nthat most FCM-based methods suffer from. Simultaneously, the\nproposed method could preserve image details as well as suppress\nimage noises via the use of local label information. Experiments\nconducted on both synthetic and clinical images show that the\nproposed method is very effective, providing mitigation to the\ncluster-size sensitivity problem, resistance to noisy images, and\napplicability to data with more complex distribution.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xiangzhi Bai [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yuxuan Zhang, Haonan Liu , and Zhiguo Chen"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Label information, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain image, possibilistic fuzzy c-means (PFCM), segmentation, similarity measure.", "Sumber": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Feb 2021"}
