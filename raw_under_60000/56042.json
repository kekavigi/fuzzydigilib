{"Nomor": 56042, "Judul": "STUDY OF NON-PRODUCTIVE TIME (NPT) IN AN INDONESIAN VAPOR-DOMINATED GEOTHERMAL WELL", "Abstrak": "Drilling cost of well take up to 50% of the total project cost for a geothermal power plant. The longer it takes to\ndrill a well, the more expensive the well becomes. Therefore, it is crucial to optimize the time spent in drilling to\noptimize the cost of a well. To achieve it, identification and analysis of the non-productive time (NPT) incurred\nwhile drilling a well is necessary.\nThis study discusses an Indonesian vapor-dominated geothermal exploration well that failed to reach the final\ntrajectory with the last status remaining idle. A review of drilling operations was carried out in this study by\ncomparing and visualizing well plans with actual operations. However, there was a more non-productive time\n(NPT) found than productive time (PT). The results of the identification and analysis state that almost all causes\nof NPT are borehole problems.\nSeveral recommendations from related literature for pre-drilling and post-drilling operation are also proposed at\nthe end of this paper. These recommendations can be applied to improve future wells drilling operation and hence\nsaving on costs.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Dorro Elgratiaus Lumban Gaol": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/227479", "2021 TA PP DORRO ELGRATIAUS LUMBAN GAOL 1.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/228804"}, "Penulis": "Dorro Elgratiaus Lumban Gaol [12217030]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dimas Taha Maulana, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Drilling, Cost, Non-Productive Time.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Jun 2021"}
