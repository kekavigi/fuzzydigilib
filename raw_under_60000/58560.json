From three objectives mentioned earlier, usable means the hole or producing formation is not irreparably damaged (N.J. Adams, 1985). This objective makes the drilling fluid becomes one of the important topics in the various aspects of well planning.\nFrom the various kinds of additives used in the drilling fluid selection, barite (BaSO4) is the most commonly used weighting agent because of its low cost and high purity. The use of barite in the drilling mud is to increase the mud density and furthermore to control hydrostatic pressure. Because of these benefits, barite is usually used to kill a kick where proper planning should be done in order to determine the necessary quantity of barite in minimizing solid invasion that eventually can lead to formation damage or tecnhically known as skin. In practice, the presence of skin can be repaired by stimulation, either acidizing or hydraulic fracturing. However, in case of high skin, stimulation is somtimes considered less effective, so other methods such as twin well, sidetracking, and multilateral well can be applied with engineering and economics considerations.\nThis study will present the one of other methods by adopting the concept of twin well planning, where drilling new well is done to avoid skin area of previous well. The results of this study are the identification and analysis of the previous drilling operation which caused the high skin formation and proper design of twin well, along with its etimation of economics, as an alternative solution to solve the problem.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Randy Hasudungan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/232127"}, "Penulis": "Randy Hasudungan [12210048]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
