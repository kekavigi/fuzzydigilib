Success story of LSWI experiments in enhancing oil recovery for the past two decades have led to\nnumerous evolving ideas regarding the combination of LSWI with other Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) methods,\nsuch as polymer injection. LSWI and polymer injection are two different but potentially complementary EOR\ntechniques. LSWI improves pore-scale displacement efficiency by changing the wettability of the reservoir rocks\ntoward more water-wet. Polymer injection improves fractional flow and sweep efficiency by improving the\nmobility ratio for the displacement.\nThis study discusses the primary mechanism plus potential benefit of adding polymer substances into LSWI on\nthe suspended well, along with the sensitivity analysis on several key parameters that would affect the simulation\nresult that will be carried out at the structure \"B\" of the \"S\" Field in Indonesia. In order to accomplish these main\nobjectives, evaluation of the field characteristic and more literature studies on how low salinity water and polymer\ninjection work jointly together must be taken into account. A simulation study is performed using the CMG\nGEMTM and CMG STARSTM software with a compositional fluid model. The analysis then is carried out based\non oil production and the distribution of oil saturation results obtained.\nThe simulation result proves that there is certainly more increase in cumulative oil production by the end of the\nproject, which has been determined for as long as 15 years, using a combined low salinity water-polymer injection\nthan that uses only high or low salinity water injection. This increase is partly due to the improved oil sweep\nefficiency, as the addition of polymers can mobilize part of the oil detached by the low-salinity brine, which\notherwise would have been trapped. Design of optimized operational parameters results in the best scenario of\n13.18% additional gain of oil recovery by injecting the solution with: 1800 ppm of water salinity, polymer\nconcentration of 10 wt%, and 600 bbl/day of injection rate. The combination of LSWI and polymer injection is\nsuggested as a promising recovery method for further research and implementation.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Anisa Nugrahaningtyas": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/227596", "2021 TA PP ANISA NUGRAHANINGTYAS 1.pdf5?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/228761"}, "Penulis": "Anisa Nugrahaningtyas [12217085]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
