{"Nomor": 54845, "Judul": "PROXIMATE ANALYSIS AND DETERMINATION OF LEAD IN SELECTED COMMERCIAL BRANDS OF INSTANT NOODLES", "Abstrak": "Noodles are one of the staple foods consumed in many Asian countries. Instant noodles have\nbecome internationally recognized food, and worldwide consumption is on the rise. Given the rising\nconsumption of instant noodles, production of this item with wheat flour has potential to improve\nnutrient intakes in Asia. The increasing consumption of noodles has led to concerted efforts to\nexplore the feasibility of using instant noodles as a vehicle for micronutrient fortification. The aim\nof this study has been to investigate and give an insight on the varying levels of major ingredients\nof instant noodles, presenting as a mean for potential modification of the nutrition label to be an\neffective food vehicle for dietary intake. Proximate and heavy metal analysis of six instant noodles\nsamples was carried out using standard analytical methods. The proximate analysis showed the\npresence of moisture content 2.15% - 7.80%, ash content 1.00% - 1.80%, fat content 11.00% -\n19.40%, crude protein content 5.51% - 12.20%, crude fibre content 2.00% - 5.85% and carbohydrate\ncontent 57.75% - 77.74%. The heavy metal (Pb) in four samples occurred at levels relatively above\nthe minimum tolerable limit of WHO (2003). Hence, caution should be taken in the successive\nconsumption of these noodles to avoid diseases associated with the over time accumulation of\nthese heavy metals especially in samples where they appeared in relatively high amount.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Ameet Kaur Jasvinder Singh": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/224786"}, "Penulis": "Ameet Kaur Jasvinder Singh [10713763]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. apt.
