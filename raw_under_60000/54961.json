{"Nomor": 54961, "Judul": "MOTION CORRECTION IN OPTICAL RESOLUTION PHOTOACOUSTIC MICROSCOPY", "Abstrak": "In this paper,we are proposing a novelmotion\ncorrection algorithm for high-resolution OR-PAM imaging.\nOur algorithm combines a modified demons-based tracking\napproach with a newly developed multi-scale vascular\nfeature matching method to track motion between adjacent\nB-scan images without needing any reference object.\nWe first applied this algorithm to correct motion artifacts\nwithin one three-dimensional (3D) data segment of rat iris\nobtained with OR-PAM imaging. We then extended the\napplication of this algorithm to correct motions to obtain\nvasculature imaging in the whole mouse back. In here,\nwe stitched five adjacent 3D data segments (large fieldof-\nview) obtained while changing the focus of OR-PAM\ndifferently for each subarea. The results showed that the\nmotion artifacts of both large blood vessels and microvessels\ncould be accurately corrected in both cases.Compared \nto the manually stitching method and the traditional SIFT\nalgorithm, the algorithm proposed in this paper has better\nperformance in stitching adjacent data segments. The high\naccuracy of the motion correction algorithm makes it valuable\nin OR-PAM for high-resolution imaging of large animals\nand for quantitative functional imaging.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Huangxuan Zhao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ningbo Chen , Tan Li, Jianhui Zhang, Riqiang Lin, Xiaojing Gong, Liang Song, Zhicheng Liu, Chengbo Liu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "High resolution imaging, large field-ofview, motion correction, optical resolution photoacoustic microscopy, stitching.", "Sumber": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING, VOL. 38, NO. 9, SEPTEMBER 2019", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Jun 2021"}
