{"Nomor": 57860, "Judul": "MODELING OF \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdMV\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd TYPE SWAB CUP PACKER AS ONE DIRECTIONAL VALVE", "Abstrak": "This study is conducted in order to model the use of the swab cup packer to control the flow so as to avoid cross flow between two productive layers of formation. Crossflow between layers can reduce the reservoir's ability to flow fluids. The theoretical basis used in modeling the cup packer as a one direction valve is the Tesla valve theory.\nThe method used in this study is simulation modeling. This study focuses on the reverse flow, in this case the upward flow in the swab cup packer. The research method begins by building a 3D model of the swab cup packer, which will then be used as input in the fluid flow simulation. Simulations were carried out at several different inlet pressure values but at constant outlet pressure values. Simulations were carried out on two different geometries, fluid flow in the annulus with a swab cup packer, and fluid flow in the annulus without a swab cup packer. The simulation results are then analyzed by comparing the flowrate values obtained from each case.\nThis study is the first study to model the swab cup packer as a one-directional valve. The results showed that the swab cup packer succeed to block the flow with greater difference in inlet and outlet pressures than the flow at the annulus without using a swab cup packer. This indicates that the flow in the swab cup packer provides greater energy loss. The simulation results show that the swab cup packer can restrict the fluid flow rate in the annulus by an average of 56.7% when compared to the fluid flow in the annulus without using a swab cup packer with the same inlet pressure and outlet pressure conditions. This is due to the fin on the swab cup packer causing the flow medium to expand suddenly, so that the fluid loses energy.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Willy B.M.
