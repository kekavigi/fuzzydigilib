{"Nomor": 56101, "Judul": "IMPROVING RESERVES THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF MACHINE LEARNING TO RAPIDLY IDENTIFY AND INTERPRET LOW RESISTIVITY/LOW CONTRAST ZONES IN THE GUMAI FORMATION", "Abstrak": "The oil and gas industry was already under immense pressure following the 2014 oil price crash. The outbreak of\nCOVID-19 exacerbates the already egregious conditions by dropping demand in an unprecedented manner.\nNevertheless, due to its role as one of the biggest affordable energy suppliers, its existence will still be paramount\nfor decades to come. With decreasing profit margins in the E&P business, optimizing existing fields may be the\nbest strategy moving forward. One of the alternatives is identifying and developing low resistivity/low contrast\n(LRLC) reservoirs which can significantly increase reserves and production with minimum outlay. However,\nsince these zones are hard to distinguish through conventional log analysis, they are often bypassed. Luckily, it\nhas been shown that machine learning algorithms can improve efficiency and help solve many problems in the\npetroleum industry.\nA novel systematic workflow, augmented with machine learning, was developed to rapidly identify and interpret\npotential LRLC zones to tackle this problem. LRLC zones can be defined as commercial hydrocarbon producing\nintervals without the useful contrast in measured resistivity with shale and/or water-bearing zones. The occurrence\nof LRLC zones may be caused by laminated shale-sand sequences, conductive minerals, fine-grained sands, and\nmicroporosity. In all those cases, significant amounts of hydrocarbons have been reported to be produced.\nFirst, a thorough analysis of the major causes of LRLC zones and their respective manifestations in the logging\ncurves was conducted. Unsupervised learning algorithms were then used to cluster the log data based on their\nsimilarities. Consequently, potential LRLC zones can be identified efficiently. Combined with all available data\n(e.g., mud logs, core analyses, etc.), the cause(s) of the LRLC pays could be identified, and water saturations could\nbe computed more accurately. The developed workflow was then applied to 15 wells in the Gumai formation for\nvalidation. Comparisons with the results obtained from conventional log analysis, done by a third party, showed\nthat the developed program could identify all LRLC zones, including potential zones still bypassed by the\nconventional analysis. This workflow will help log analysts to rapidly identify and interpret LRLC zones, which\ncould significantly increase efficiency, reduce risks, drive profits, and create value in stringent times.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Winfield Hansen": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/227582"}, "Penulis": "Winfield Hansen [12217065]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ardhi Hakim Lumban Gaol, S.T., M.T., M.Si., Ph.D.", "Steven Chandra, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "low resistivity/low contrast reservoirs, machine learning, marginal field development", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Jun 2021"}
