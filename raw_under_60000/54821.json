{"Nomor": 54821, "Judul": "PERFORMANCE PREDICTION GUIDELINE FOR CO2 FLOODING IN INDONESIA USING EMPIRICAL EQUATION", "Abstrak": "This paper describe the use of correlation develop by NPC ( National Petroleum Council ) and U.S. DOE ( Departement Of Energy ) 1 to predict the incremental recovery under CO2 flooding after constructing a guideline from literature and expert technical judgement. The guideline including data assumption, EOR method screening and Performance Prediction. Sub surface data evaluation (SSDE)2was conducted for hundreds of oil field in Indonesia to judge for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) recommendation, 29 field was chosen from the result of second reference for the purpose of this study. EOR screening method then use to estimate if a field which evaluated per reservoir/zone is suitable for CO2 flooding. Total Remaining Oil In Place (ROIP) of 6928.43 MMSTB is evaluated under CO2 flooding mechanism and recovery efficiency found to be around 35%. Sensitivity analysis for Ev and SCO2 shown that 0.1 changes in both parameter value resulted in increasing 3.835% incremental recovery factor for Ev alteration and decreasing 4.395% incremental recovery factor for SCO2 alteration. It is important to remember that the result of this study is a first review screening that use field project experience to determine the incremental recovery, simulation and pilot test required to estimate more accurate result. This first review screening is a powerful tool for law maker such as goverment or house of representative to construct strategic policy regarding oil and gas future plan.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Fajar Caesar Ramadhan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/224757"}, "Penulis": "Fajar Caesar Ramadhan [12211047]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
