{"Nomor": 52032, "Judul": "HETEROSCEDASTIC GAUSSIAN PROCESS REGRESSION USING NEAREST NEIGHBOR POINT ESTIMATES", "Abstrak": "In exploring engineering design based on physical experiments/stochastic simulators,\nnoise might have significant effects on the observed sample that the use of\ndeterministic surrogate model is not inadequate since its inability to distinguish\nthe true function and the noise. Gaussian process (GP) is one type of surrogate\nmodels that have been extensively used in practice to handle noisy problems. In\nits standard procedure, the standard homoscedastic GP learn the noisy samples\nby assuming the noise level is uniform across the input spaces. This variant of\nGP however is not appropriate when the variance of the noise is varying in the\ninput spaces, i.e., heteroscedastic. Various heteroscedastic GP (HGP) models\nhave been developed to extend the GP model in learning heteroscedastic problems.\nThis study focuses on this HGP model that does not require any additional\nreplication, which has advantages in terms of experimental cost. One of the\nlatest approaches to this variant of HGP model is called Improved Most Likely\nHeteroscedastic GP (IMLHGP) that have already showed good performances in\nmodeling heteroscedastic problems. IMLHGP, as the state-of-the-art, also has\na very attractive computational efficiency in training the model. However, the\nIMLHGP model is found to require high number of training samples as the model\nis observed to perform poorly when the number of training samples is rather low.\nThis requirement is definitely unfavorable when the experimental cost is already\nexpensive, such as in aerospace problems. In reducing the training sample size\nrequirement, this thesis proposes a modified HGP model based on the IMLHGP\nby augmenting an extra distance-based nonparametric regression to tackle the\nwrongly interpolating noise level predictions that frequently appears in IMLHGP when the number of training samples is small. This proposed model called Nearest\nNeighbor Point Estimates HGP (NNPEHGP) is tested on several heteroscedastic\nproblems, consisting of two mathematical functions, two real-world experimental\ndatasets, two real-world analytical problems, and a stochastic simulator. The results\nshow the superiority of NNPEHGP to the IMLHGP in terms of predictive\naccuracy and robustness, especially when the number of training samples is low.\nIt is also found that NNPEHGP is much more stable in learning high dimensional\nheteroscedastic problems.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Muhammad Daffa Robani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/217658", "COVER Muhammad Daffa Robani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/232603", "PUSTAKA Muhammad Daffa Robani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/232609"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Daffa Robani [23619020]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Lavi Rizki Zuhal", "Pramudita Satria Palar, S.T., M.T., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "Gaussian processes surrogate model, heteroscedastic", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "8 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Jan 2021"}
