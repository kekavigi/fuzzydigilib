{"Nomor": 51411, "Judul": "STUDY OF RAPID HEAT TREATMENT EFFECT USING INDUCTION HEATING ON MICROSTUCTURAL EVOLUTION AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF AISI 4340 STEEL", "Abstrak": "Steel is a metal with a wide range of applications and variations. From daily home\nappliances into airplane spare parts cannot be separated from steel. One type of steel\nis medium carbon steel. This steel has 0.3-0.6 % carbon, which has good\nmechanical properties and its performance can be increased by heat treatment. One\nof medium carbon steel that is widely used in airplanes, manufacturing industries,\nand defense industry is AISI 4340 steel series. AISI 4340 steel series has good\ntoughness and its mechanical properties will improve significantly with proper heat\ntreatments. Common heat treatment such as conventional heat treatment is not\nenough to increase the strength of AISI 4340. Nowadays, a lot of manufacturing\ncompanies use induction heating to heat the specimen. Induction heating dispenses\nrapid, contactless, and efficient heating of conductive materials such as steel. This\nstudy will investigate the effect of rapid heating using induction heating on the\naustenitization temperature, microstructure, and mechanical properties of AISI\n4340.\nFirst, an assortment of published research papers, books and other sources of\ninformation related to rapid heating rate, heat treatment, induction heating, and\nAISI 4340 steel. Other supporting information for the author also gathered. Next,\nirrelevant research result is eliminated. Then, discussion and analysis of collected\ninformation done to answer the literature review objective. The analysis will\nprovide an understanding of the rapid heating effect on microstructural evolution\nand mechanical properties of AISI 4340 steel. Finally, the conclusion and\nsuggestion were obtained from the conducted literature review.\nThe rapid heat treatment of AISI 4340 steel will result in a slight grain refinement\non the final microstructure of as-received specimens due to the site for austenite\nnucleation is limited. A finer grain size will be obtained if the prior microstructural\neffect of the specimen is eliminated by pre-treatment such as conventional heat\ntreatment quenching (CHQ), spheroidizing, and cold working. By eliminating the\nprior microstructural effect, multiple nucleation sites will be formed which results\nin finer grain size. The mechanical properties of the treated specimens show an\nincrease in yield strength and tensile strength but slightly decrease the total\nelongation. The improvement in strength is due to the finer grain of the observed\nspecimen and other possibilities, for example, an increase in the fraction of\nmartensite and bainite and an increase in pearlite fraction followed by the decrease\nin ferrite fraction. Rapid heating of AISI 4340 also increases the austenitization\ncritical temperature, in other words, the higher temperature is required for the\naustenite nucleation.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Mancho Resvana": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214826"}, "Penulis": "Mancho Resvana [12516035]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr.Eng.
