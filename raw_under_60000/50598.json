{"Nomor": 50598, "Judul": "MINIMIZING DYNAMIC LOADING RESONANCE OF E-TRIKE BATTERY PACK SUBJECTED TO ROAD PROFILE LOADS", "Abstrak": "E-trike is the electric vehicle to transport goods for medium range. The battery pack design should provide safety to the E-trike. One of the main problems for batteries is the deformations of the components due to vibrational loads which are mainly from engines, road profiles, and environment. Load from road profiles is the most significant load from vibrations loads.\nThis thesis discusses road profile displacements for every road class, Quarter Car Model (QCM), modal analysis, and harmonic analysis of the battery pack. Resonance occurs when the frequency of the load is coincidence with the natural frequencies of the battery pack. Modal analysis is used to find the natural frequencies of the battery pack on several modes of vibrations. The selection of the possible modes is from the deformations shapes and the values of the natural frequencies within 0 Hz until 500 Hz. ISO 8608 becomes the standard in generating road profiles for different road classes. Simulink of the Quarter Car Model (QCM) produce the output of the load from the road profiles. The load from the road profiles is used as the input in the Ansys 16.0 Harmonic Analysis. The output is the deformation frequency response for the bottom and rear side of the battery pack. Location of the resonance frequencies is examined to increase durability of the battery pack.\nIn conclusion, damping mechanism is the suitable technology to decrease the major amplitude of the deformations from road profile loadings at about 54% from the previous model. The lower deformations of the battery pack component reduce the possible accident of the battery pack from vibrational loadings.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Farkhan Abdillah [13116079]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Bentang Arief Budiman, S.T., M.Eng.", "Poetro Lebdo Sambegoro, M.Sc., Ph.D.", "Dr. Ir.
