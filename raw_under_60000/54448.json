There are several ways to\nsolve that bottleneck problem, in example increase the pipe diameter or make a pararel pipe section next to\nbottleneck pipe. Several factors that may caused the bottleneck problem are the frictional force that too big, pipe\ninternal diameter too small compare to fluid debit, and the pipe elevation is too steep etc.\nProblem that going to be discussed in this paper is how to detect bottleneck problem using presure\ndrop at several segment of pipe in field \u201cM\u201d. This problem has been discussed by the writer\u2019s* previous project\nthat using IPM version 7.5 software. From the software simulation result show that bottleneck doesn\u2019t occured\nin pipeline network in field \u201cM\u201d, but this result not trusted enough. Therefore, in this paper will be analyzed the\npressure changing on each length unit to prove wheter bottleneck occured or not. Several solution also created to\nsolved that bottleneck problem.", "Daftar File": {"2011 TA PP MUHAMMAD UBAIDILLAH 1-ABSTRAk.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/222760"}, "Penulis": "Mohammad Ubaidillah [12207001]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
