{"Nomor": 57198, "Judul": "MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION OF CENTRIFUGAL COMPRESSOR IMPELLER USING GAUSSIAN PROCESS REGRESSION", "Abstrak": "Centrifugal compressor is widely used and applied to turbomachinery for industrial\nand aerospace purposes. Nowadays, compressors are demanded to have high perfor-\nmance so they will produce fewer emissions or lighter engines with the same output\npower or thrust. To achieve an excellent performance of the centrifugal compres-\nsor, there are two important parameters that we need to notice, which are pressure\nratio and eciency. However, improving one of these parameters sometimes will\nreduce the performance of the other parameter. Thus, this study will focus on\nmulti-objective optimization to improve the overall performance of the impeller of\nthe SRV2-O centrifugal compressor by deforming its impeller. Using Bayesian op-\ntimization and NSGA-II assisted by surrogate model, the impeller, which has been\nparameterized using control point of Bezier curve, will be optimized by two and ten\nvariables (control point) optimization. The optimization processes have successfully\nobtained several solutions called Pareto front. One solution is chosen as the opti-\nmized solution, this solution improves the pressure ratio by 1.14% and eciency by\n2.67%. Moreover, this design reduces the strength of the shock wave at the leading\nedge and delays the \now separation closer to the trailing edge. The sensitivity anal-\nysis is conducted to gain important knowledge about the physics of the \now and\nits relation to the input variables. Theta angle control points near the inlet are the\nmost responsible variables for this optimization.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Bariq Badruttamam Nasution": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/229854"}, "Penulis": "Bariq Badruttamam Nasution [13617020]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Lavi Rizki Zuhal", "Pramudita Satria Palar, S.T., M.T., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Centrifugal compressor, impeller, multi-objective optimization, sensitivity analysis, shockwaves,  ow separation", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Jul 2021"}
