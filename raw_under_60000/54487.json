{"Nomor": 54487, "Judul": "STUDY OF SECONDARY METABOLITES FROM MARINE-DERIVED FUNGI AND ACTINOBACTERIA WITH CYTOTOXIC ACTIVITY AGAINST COLORECTAL CANCER CELL LINES", "Abstrak": "olorectal cancer is a disease pertinent due to its prevalence, with notable presence in\npopulations of developed countries. There are several challenges in conventional\npharmacological treatments utilizing chemotherapy that needs to be addressed. The severity of\nits adverse effects means that this therapy is not optimized in improving the quality of life of\nthe elderly as the target subpopulation that often suffers from colorectal cancer, while there\nalso exists resistance against chemotherapeutic agents that incapacitate their effectiveness.\nTherefore, this review observed the contemporary literature for the past ten years regarding\nsecondary metabolites sourced from marine-derived fungi and actinobacteria as novel\nalternatives for cytotoxic agents against colorectal cancer cell lines. There are observed 51\ncompounds from the last decade explored, in which compounds of varied strengths from the\nmarine fungi genus Aspergillus sp., Penicillium sp., Neosartorya sp., Dichotomomyces sp.,\nParadendryphiella sp. and Westerdykella sp. as well as the actinobacteria genus Streptomyces\nsp. and Nocardiopsis sp. are observed. In terms of groupings based on chemicals, categories of\nchemicals found included peptides (diketopiperazines, other cyclic peptides, lipopeptidyl\nbenzophenones, lipopeptides), alkaloids (indoles, cytochalasans, cytochalasins, and a tyrosine\nderivative), heterocyclic aromatics (one each for the groups piperazine, pyrazine and furan),\nbianthrones, anthranillic acid derivatives, ?-amino acid derivatives, and macrolides.\nFurthermore, regarding marine microorganisms, this study also summarizes and analyzes\nmethods for microbial isolation and cultivation, alongside the separation techniques for their\ndesired metabolites and the cytotoxic assays and analyses performed. From 31 metabolites\nsourced from the marine fungi and 20 sourced from the marine actinobacteria, evaluated and\ndetermined through their respective anticancer potencies in IC50 values, tested against the cell\nlines HCT116, HT29, HCT15, RKO, Caco2, and SW480. With such method, very strong\nactivities were noted for secondary metabolites sourced from Aspergillus sp., Penicillium sp.,\nParadendryphiella sp. and the actinobacteria Streptomyces sp. Meanwhile, indole alkaloids\nand diketopiperazines make up the majority of the compounds, as 9 and 8 metabolites\nrespectively. Higher potencies existing in several compounds from those groups were reasoned\nthrough the presence of halogen-based functional groups and sulphide groups in indoles and\ndiketopiperazines, respectively.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Ikram Ammar Abrian": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/222910"}, "Penulis": "Ikram Ammar Abrian [11616107]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["apt.
