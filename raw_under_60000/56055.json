{"Nomor": 56055, "Judul": "THE IMPLEMENTATION OF COMPOSITIONAL EQUATION OF STATE FOR PRODUCED CONDENSED WATER CHARACTERIZATION IN DRY GAS RESERVOIR OF WELL-X", "Abstrak": "This study presents a current issue happens in one of many dry gas reservoirs in Indonesia. The mismatch of produced water prediction due to condensed water ignorance leads the necessity of further understanding of phase behavior and fluid properties. PVT analysis was carried out through Peng-Robinson equation of state (EOS) in a commercial software. Furthermore, water content estimation was reviewed under several parameters, including pressure, temperature, and fluid compositions (CO2 and N2). The software-generated graphs represent pretty good results which are in accordance with the previous literature. The details emphasize the leverage of those variables and the causative factors. Based on the study results: (1) the changes in system conditions caused by pressure, temperature, and composition will affect the water content; (2) as the pressure increases under the isothermal condition, the water content and WGR will gradually decrease at certain level; (3) on the contrary, the increase in temperature under isobaric condition will be in line with water content and WGR; (4) CO2 existence improves water vapor solubility hence the water content will be higher along with the increase of its concentration; (5) N2 existence minimizes water content due to degradation of water vaporization and dissolved water vapor in gas.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Cinndy Claudia": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/227497"}, "Penulis": "Cinndy Claudia [12217010]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Rani Kurnia, S.Si., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "water content, pressure, temperature, CO2, N2", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Jun 2021"}
