The non-caloric properties of this compound are used\nbroadly as a dietary-sweetener for diabetic patients. The isolation method of this\ncompound has been developed but encountered an obstacle when laboratory\nmethod is apply in industrial scale production. In the present study, isolation of\nstevioside from etanolic Stevia rebaudiana (Bertoni) leaves extract was developed\nusing a polymethacrylate macroporous resin. Study static adsorption/desorption\ndan adsorption isothermic of resin had been conducted by shaking stevioside\nsolution dan resin mix in Erlenmeyer at room temperature. Some solution sample\nwas collected from the mix then determined the stevioside content using highperformance liquid chromatography. The adsorption ratio dan capacity of the resin\nto stevioside are 152.21 mg/g dry resin dan 71.91% on a stevioside solution with\npurity of >60%, respectively. On the extract solution, the adsorption ratio dan\ncapacity of the resin to stevioside showed 191.57 mg/g dry resin dan 65.07%,\nrespectively. Kinetic data for both solutions obeyed the pseudo-second-order\nkinetic model. Adsorption isothermic data of extract solution showed a good\ncorrelation coefficient of Langmuir equation with dimensionless separation factor\n(RL) obtained 0.140. The value of RL was in the range of 0 < RL < 1 that concluded\nthe adsorption of stevioside in the polymethacrylate resin is favorable. The\nadsorption stevioside into the resin occured easily due to the 1/n value in the\nFreundlich equation is between 0.1 dan 0.5 (0.1802). Column packed with resin to\nperform dynamic adsorpstion dan desorption tests of stevioside into resin.\nPurification of stevioside using polymethacrilate macroporous resin with gradient\nelution using etanol (0-70% (v/v)), the content of stevioside increased from 26.10%\nto 83.82% (w/w).", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Ariranur Haniffadli": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/221402"}, "Penulis": "Ariranur Haniffadli [20718301]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Elfahmi, S.Si., M.Si.", "Dr. Rika Hartati, S.Si., M.Si."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Farmasi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Farmasi", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "stevioside, adsorption, resin, macroporous, polymethacrilate", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Mar 2021"}
