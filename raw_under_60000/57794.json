{"Nomor": 57794, "Judul": "WELL INTEGRITY STUDY FOR CO2 WAG APPLICATION IN MATURE FIELD X, SOUTH SUMATRA AREA FOR THE FULFILLMENT AS CO2 SEQUESTRATION SINK", "Abstrak": "The most of today's global oil production comes from mature fields. Oil companies and governments are both concerned about increasing oil recovery from aging resources. To maintain oil production, the mature field have to apply the Enhanced Oil Recovery method. CO2 water-alternating-gas (WAG) injection is an enhanced oil recovery method designed to improve sweep efficiency during CO2 injection with the injected water to control the mobility of CO2.\nThis study will discuss possible corrosion during CO2 and water injection and the casing load calculation along with the production tubing during the injection phase. The following study also performed a suitable material selection for the best performance injection. This research was conducted by evaluating casing integrity for simulate CO2 water-alternating-gas (WAG) to be applied in the X-well in the Y-field, South Sumatra, Indonesia. Corrosion prediction were performed using Electronic Corrosion Engineer (ECE\u00ae) corrosion model and for the strength of tubing which included burst, collapse, and tension of production casing was assessed using Microsoft Excel.\nThis study concluded that for the casing load calculation results in 600 psi of burst pressure, collapse pressure of 2,555.64 psi, and tension of 190,528 lbf. All of these results are still following the K-55 production casing rating. While injecting CO2, the maximum corrosion rate occurs. It has a maximum corrosion rate of 2.02 mm/year and a minimum corrosion rate of 0.36 mm/year. With this value, it is above NORSOK Standard M-001 which is 2 mm/year and needs to be evaluated to prevent the rate to remain stable and not decrease in the following years. To prevent the effect of maximum corrosion rate, the casing material must use a SM13CR (Martensitic Stainless Steel) which is not sour service material.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Muchammad Raykhan Naufal [12217082]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prasandi Abdul Aziz, S.Si., M.T.", "Steven Chandra, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "CO2 Water-Alternating-Gas (WAG), Corrosion, Casing Load", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Agu 2021"}
