It is important to plan the right restoration tooth material to avoid any\ninfection or leakage happened on the tooth. Before this final project conducted and written,\na research on ETT with zirconium endocrown and overlay was already conducted. The\nresearch [1] concluded that a zirconium endocrown of a first molar ETT can withstand a\n720N vertical load and the critical concentrated force on the model will remains on the CEJ\npart of the remaining tooth. CEJ or Cemento-enamel junction is the area of union of the\ncementum and enamel at the cervical region of tooth. It represents the limit between the\ncrown and root surface.\nThe current research was done by performing computational simulation using the\nfinite element analysis tools. Two types of load were simulated: a 720N vertical load with\nthe direction parallel to the tooth\u2019s length axis and a 200N load with 45? angle from the\ntooth\u2019s length axis. The model used are an endodontically treated tooth (ETT) with onlay\nrestoration and an ETT with endocrown restoration. In this research, two types of luting\ncement will be used: Variolink Esthetic LC and RelyX Ultimate, while using a ceromer\ncalled ceramage for the crown restoration. The simulation shows the effect of luting cement application to Endodontically\nTreated Teeth based on the crown restoration. In the case of ETT with CEC and onlay\nrestoration, it is shown that RelyX Ultimate strengthens both dentine and enamel of ETT in\ncomparison to Variolink E application For ETT with endocrown restoration, Variolink\nprotects the dentine and enamel of ETT better in comparison to dentine and enamel of ETT\nwith RelyX Ultimate luting cement. This conclusion is taken for the dentine and enamel of\nthese parts experiences smaller stresses compared to the comparison dentine and enamel.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Daniella Esmeralda Sitanggang": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/221602"}, "Penulis": "Daniella Esmeralda Sitanggang [13116207]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Satrio Wicaksono ST, M.Eng., Ph.D.", "Prof. Dr. Ir.
