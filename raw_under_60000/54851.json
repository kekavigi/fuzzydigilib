{"Nomor": 54851, "Judul": "NUMERICAL METHOD FOR POLLUTANT TRANSPORT", "Abstrak": "Pollutant transport phenomenon has been a concerning problem in our efforts\nto preserve the environment. Mathematically, this phenomenon is usually portrayed\nby the advection diffusion equation which is derived from Fick\u2019s first law and the\ncontinuation equation. In this study, the mathematical model is observed in one and\ntwo dimensions which is then solved using four different numerical methods. We\nuse the 2nd, 4th and 6th order Forward Time Centered Space and Forward Time\nBackwards Space Centered Space to solve the mathematical methods. Later, this\nstudy further examines the methods by determining the stability conditions,\nconsistency and the order of accuracy by using the Von Neumann stability analysis\nand Taylor series. To follow that, we confirm each method and its properties by\ncomparing the numerical results with an existing analytical problems and solutions.\nFrom those experiments, we can conclude that every method is able to represent the\nanalytical solution. However, in each dimension and each method possesses\ndifferent stability conditions and orders of accuracy. In obtaining this result, we\nbelieve that this study could illustrate the pollutant transport phenomenon.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK LAVINCA SUHAIMI.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/224800"}, "Penulis": "Lavinca Suhaimi [10117050]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ikha Magdalena, S.Si., M.Si"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Matematika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Pollutant transport, Advection diffusion equation, Finite difference schemes, Stability conditions", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Dwi Ary Fuziastuti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Jun 2021"}
