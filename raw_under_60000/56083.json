Indonesia itself is one of the largest world\u2019s ????????2 emitters and\nIndonesia already committed itself to the Paris Agreement in the emission reduction mission. Carbon Capture\nStorage (CCS) can be considered as one of the solutions to reduce carbon dioxide emission. To conduct this\nsolution safely and to know technical uncertainty and possibility will be caused by the event, several processes\nneed to be done, start from the preliminary study (feasibility study) to the pilot-scale project. In this study,\nScreening and engineering evaluation are carried out to analyze the feasibility of field \u201cX\u201d for the ????????2\nSequestration project. Several processes will be done in this study, start from literature study, field geological\nscreening, ????????2 storage capacity estimation, and ????????2 containment analysis. ECLIPSE 2010 simulation is used to\nsimulate the project. From the result and discussion, Field \u201cX\u201d has been considered as feasible for future carbon\ncapture sequestration project with an estimated capacity of 182350 MMSCF with good containment for 10 years\nof project.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Muhammad Harry Wijaya": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/227544"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Harry Wijaya [12217041]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Dedy Irawan, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Carbon Capture Storage, Screening, Engineering evaluation, Feasibility Study,", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Jun 2021"}
