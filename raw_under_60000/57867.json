There have been many ESPs applications in fields with low-medium\nenthalpy reservoirs and Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) fields that have proven successful in foreign\ncountries such as the United States and Honduras. Meanwhile in Indonesia, ESP technology has never been\napplied because Indonesia is still focused on geothermal field exploration and field development projects with\nhigh-enthalpy reservoirs. This study will focus on the ESP installation in the \u201cX\u201d Geothermal Field. The objectives\nof this study is to analyze and evaluate the completion test and production test data to understand the condition of\nthe existing wells in the field, determine the optimum ESP design to be implemented in the well, and provide\nrecommendations to improve the economic and field side with low-medium enthalpy reservoirs.\nUnderstanding the characteristics and estimation of well production capability is the initial stage for the\ndevelopment of feasibility studies for ESP applications in wells on \u201cX\u201d Geothermal Field. The calculation in\ndetermining the most optimum ESP design is done by determining the depth of the pump, the pump suction\npressure, the total distance required for the pump to lift the geothermal fluid, and last, selecting the type of pump.\nThe calculation results show that the well in the \"X\" Geothermal Field can be implemented by ESP with designs\nsuch as the depth of the pump at 740 m, the production capacity of 25.03 kg/s, the distance required for the pump\nto lift the geothermal fluid of 2,578.1 ft, the efficiency of 73%, there are 48 total stages required, and the power\nrequired to power the ESP is 223.71 kW.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Titis Swari Wigati": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/231479"}, "Penulis": "Titis Swari Wigati [12217035]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dimas Taha Maulana, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "geothermal field, low enthalpy, Electric Submersible Pump (ESP)", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Agu 2021"}
