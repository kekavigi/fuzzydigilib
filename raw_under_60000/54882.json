{"Nomor": 54882, "Judul": "3-D RECONSTRUCTION IN CANONICAL CO-ORDINATE SPACE FROM ARBITRARILY ORIENTED 2-D IMAGES", "Abstrak": "Limited capture range, and the requirement\nto provide high quality initialization for optimization-based\n2-D/3-D image registration methods, can significantly\ndegrade the performance of 3-D image reconstruction and\nmotion compensation pipelines. Challenging clinical imaging\nscenarios, which contain significant subject motion,\nsuch as fetal in-utero imaging, complicate the 3-D image and\nvolume reconstruction process. In this paper, we present\na learning-based image registration method capable of\npredicting 3-D rigid transformations of arbitrarily oriented\n2-D image slices, with respect to a learned canonical atlas\nco-ordinate system. Only image slice intensity information\nis used to perform registration and canonical alignment,\nno spatial transform initialization is required. To find\nimage transformations, we utilize a convolutional neural\nnetwork architecture to learn the regression function capable\nof mapping 2-D image slices to a 3-D canonical atlas\nspace. We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of our\napproach quantitatively on simulated magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI), fetal brain imagery with synthetic motion\nand further demonstrate qualitative results on real fetal\nMRI data where our method is integrated into a full reconstruction\nand motion compensation pipeline. Our learning\nbased registration achieves an average spatial prediction\nerror of 7 mm on simulated data and produces qualitatively\nimproved reconstructions for heavily moving fetuses with\ngestational ages of approximately 20 weeks. Our model\nprovides a general and computationally efficient solution to\nthe 2-D/3-D registration initialization problem and is suitable\nfor real-time scenarios.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Benjamin Hou [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Bishesh Khanal , Amir Alansary , Steven McDonagh, Alice Davidson, Mary Rutherford , Jo V.
