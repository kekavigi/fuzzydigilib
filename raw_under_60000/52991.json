{"Nomor": 52991, "Judul": "PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT OF NATURAL POZZOLAN ROLLER COMPACTED CONCRETE PAVEMENTS", "Abstrak": "Concrete pavement is cost effective and beneficial because of its sustainability and durability.\nThe maintenance and renovation periods for such pavement compared to other pavements are\nrelatively long; however, a significant issue with pavements, especially roller compacted concrete\npavements (RCCP), is salt scaling which occurs due to saline solutions such as deicer salts. In the\npresent work, the performance of RCC containing a natural pozzolan called Trass, as a supplementary\ncementitious material, and an air-entraining agent for salt scaling was investigated.\nMechanical and durability tests were performed on specimens containing a water to binder ratio\nof 0.32, with and without Trass, and an air-entraining agent. It was concluded that, Trass could\nnot improve the compressive and tensile strengths, however, the permeability was improved.\nMoreover, the amount of mass loss due to salt scaling was not decreased. In all concrete mixtures,\nusing a suitable amount of an air-entraining agent to maintain a total air content of 4.5\u20135% was\nfound to be necessary for producing RCC containing Trass.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "S.A.
