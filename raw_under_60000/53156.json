{"Nomor": 53156, "Judul": "MULTI-SCALE PATCH-BASED IMAGE RESTORATION", "Abstrak": "Many image restoration algorithms in recent years\nare based on patch processing. The core idea is to decompose\nthe target image into fully overlapping patches, restore each of\nthem separately, and then merge the results by a plain averaging.\nThis concept has been demonstrated to be highly effective, leading\noften times to the state-of-the-art results in denoising, inpainting,\ndeblurring, segmentation, and other applications. While the\nabove is indeed effective, this approach has one major flaw:\nthe prior is imposed on intermediate (patch) results, rather\nthan on the final outcome, and this is typically manifested by\nvisual artifacts. The expected patch log likelihood (EPLL) method\nby Zoran and Weiss was conceived for addressing this very\nproblem. Their algorithm imposes the prior on the patches of\nthe final image, which in turn leads to an iterative restoration of\ndiminishing effect. In this paper, we propose to further extend\nand improve the EPLL by considering a multi-scale prior. Our\nalgorithm imposes the very same prior on different scale patches\nextracted from the target image. While all the treated patches\nare of the same size, their footprint in the destination image\nvaries due to subsampling. Our scheme comes to alleviate another\nshortcoming existing in patch-based restoration algorithms\u2014the\nfact that a local (patch-based) prior is serving as a model for a\nglobal stochastic phenomenon. We motivate the use of the multiscale\nEPLL by restricting ourselves to the simple Gaussian case,\ncomparing the aforementioned algorithms and showing a clear\nadvantage to the proposed method. We then demonstrate our\nalgorithm in the context of image denoising, deblurring, and\nsuper-resolution, showing an improvement in performance both\nvisually and quantitatively.", "Daftar File": {"2016 JRNL PP Vardan Papyan - 1.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/220389"}, "Penulis": "Vardan Papyan  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Michael Elad"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Image restoration, expected patch log likelihood (EPLL), Gaussian mixture model, multi-scale, denoising, deblurring, super-resolution.", "Sumber": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Mar 2021"}
