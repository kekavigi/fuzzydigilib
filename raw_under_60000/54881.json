{"Nomor": 54881, "Judul": "HISTOPATHOLOGICAL WHOLE SLIDE IMAGE ANALYSIS USING CONTEXT-BASED CBIR", "Abstrak": "Histopathological image classification (HIC)\nand content-based histopathological image retrieval\n(CBHIR) are two promising applications for the\nhistopathological whole slide image (WSI) analysis. HIC\ncan efficiently predict the type of lesion involved in\na histopathological image. In general, HIC can aid\npathologists in locating high-risk cancer regions from a\nWSI by providing a cancerous probability map for the WSI.\nIn contrast, CBHIR was developed to allow searches for\nregions with similar content for a region of interest (ROI)\nfrom a database consisting of historical cases. Sets of\ncases with similar content are accessible to pathologists,\nwhich can provide more valuable references for diagnosis.\nA drawback of the recent CBHIR framework is that a\nquery ROI needs to be manually selected from a WSI.\nAn automatic CBHIR approach for a WSI-wise analysis\nneeds to be developed. In this paper, we propose a novel\naided-diagnosis framework of breast cancer using whole\nslide images, which shares the advantages of both HIC and\nCBHIR. In our framework, CBHIR is automatically processed\nthroughout the WSI, based on which a probability map\nregarding the malignancy of breast tumors is calculated.\nThrough the probability map, the malignant regions in\nWSIs can be easily recognized. Furthermore, the retrieval\nresults corresponding to each sub-region of the WSIs are\nrecorded during the automatic analysis and are available\nto pathologists during their diagnosis. Our method was\nvalidated on fully annotated WSI data sets of breast tumors.\nThe experimental results certify the effectiveness of the\nproposed method.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yushan Zheng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zhiguo Jiang, Haopeng Zhang, Fengying Xie , Yibing Ma, Huaqiang Shi, and Yu Zhao"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Whole slide image analysis, CBIR, breast cancer, contextual information.", "Sumber": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING, VOL. 37, NO. 7, JULY 2018", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Jun 2021"}
