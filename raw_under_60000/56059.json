{"Nomor": 56059, "Judul": "ENGINEERING EVALUATION FOR CO2 SEQUESTRATION AT THE \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdX\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd FIELD", "Abstrak": "environmental challenges of the 21st century. Because of the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the\nglobal average surface temperature has risen. One way to reduce CO2 emissions by storing CO2 deep below the\nearth's surface or deep into the oceans and therefore avoiding the greenhouse effect.\nThis study focuses on screening depleted gas reservoir which is conducted at \u201cX\u201d Field, East Java, Indonesia\nfor CO2 storage. The reservoir is characterized as a limestone reservoir. The carbon storage field screening criteria\nwere developed by Bachu (2003) with improvements by Kaldi and Gibson-Poole (2008) and IPCC (Benson et al.,\n2005). A simulation study was also performed to evaluate the storage capacity of CO2 that can be retained in the\nfield by simulation using Eclipse 2010. The Simulations were run in several scenarios.\nThe results of this study indicate that the \"X\u201d Field is suitable for the application as CO2 storage in the future.\nThe statement can be concluded because the \u201cX\u201d Field can pass 7 of 8 criteria consisting of 4 main criteria and 3\nof 4 essential criteria. One of the main criteria is that the reservoir seal is declared safe based on the table presented\nby Kaldi, which is then strengthened by looking at the movement of CO2 based on the plume evolution in the\nreservoir. The simulation result produces cumulative injection which is then converted into storage capacity.\nAccording to the findings of the sensitivity analysis, the most appropriate storage capacity is 457.65 BSCF.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Endy Tri Octavianto": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/227501"}, "Penulis": "Endy Tri Octavianto [12217015]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Dedy Irawan, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "CO2, Storage Capacity, Seal Integrity, Plume Evolution", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Jun 2021"}
