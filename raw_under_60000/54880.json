{"Nomor": 54880, "Judul": "TARGETED MOTION ESTIMATION AND REDUCTION (TAMER): DATA CONSISTENCY BASED MOTION MITIGATION FOR MRI USING A REDUCED MODEL JOINT OPTIMIZATION", "Abstrak": "We introduce a data consistency based\nretrospective motion correction method, TArgeted Motion\nEstimation and Reduction (TAMER), to correct for patient\nmotion in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Specifically,\na motion free image and motion trajectory are jointly estimated\nby minimizing the data consistency error of a SENSE\nforwardmodel including rigid-body subjectmotion. In order\nto efficiently solve this large non-linear optimization problem,\nwe employ reduced modeling in the parallel imaging\nformulation by assessing only a subset of target voxels at\neach step of the motion search. With this strategy we are\nable to effectively capture the tight coupling between the\nimage voxel values andmotion parameters.We demonstrate\nin simulations TAMER\u2019s ability to find similar search directions\ncompared to a fullmodel,with an average error of 22%,\nvs. 73% error when using previously proposed alternating\nmethods. The reduced model decreased the computation\ntime 17\u00d7 fold compared to a full image volume evaluation.\nIn phantom experiments, our method successfully mitigates\nboth translation and rotation artifacts, reducing image\nRMSE compared to a motion-free gold standard from 21%\nto 14% in a translating phantom, and from 17% to 10% in\na rotating phantom. Qualitative image improvements are\nseen in human imaging of moving subjects compared to\nconventional reconstruction. Finally, we compare in vivo\nimage results of our method to the state-of-the-art.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Melissa W. Haskell  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Stephen F.
