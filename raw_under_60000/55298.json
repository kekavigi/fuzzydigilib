{"Nomor": 55298, "Judul": "THE STUDY OF M84 JET COLLIMATION PROFILE USING THE VERY LONG BASELINE ARRAY (VLBA) DATA", "Abstrak": "Extragalactic jets are high-energy astrophysical phenomena that are found in\nthe radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN). The jet is a collimated \now of\nplasma that propagates at nearly the speed of light. The AGN jet is emanated\nfrom the center of the galaxy, and ultimately powered by the accretion onto\nthe supermassive black hole (SMBH) and propagates through the intergalactic\nmedium beyond its host galaxies. The jet can expand until kilo-parsecs\n(kpc) to Mpc. Relativistic astrophysical jets are seen not only in the radio\ngalaxies and quasars but also in supernovae and smaller black hole systems\nlike microquasars. This thesis will be focused on the jet from a radio galaxy.\nThe study of relativistic jets has been a great eort from multi-messenger\nastronomy. How the jet is produced, accelerated, and collimated is one of\nthe most important but dicult questions in astronomy, and over the past\ndecades, extensive studies have been made from theory/simulations to observations.\nTo better understand the formation of relativistic jets from SMBH,\nVery Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) is especially a powerful observational\ntechnique since one can directly resolve the jet formation scales near\nSMBH at very high angular resolution.\nIn this thesis, we study the collimation prole of the jets in the nearby radio\ngalaxy M84 using Very Long Baseline Array observations and Very Large Array\ndata. We revealed a detailed collimation prole of the M84 jet over distances\nfrom  103 rs to 108 rs. We found that the jet geometry shows a transition from\na semi-parabolic shape to a conical/hyperbolic shape at a distance of  104\nSchwarzschild radii (rs). We further compared the obtained M84 jet prole\nwith M87 whose jet collimation prole is well established in the literature. We\nfound that the M84 jet is less collimated than the M87 jet with a parabolic\npower-law index of a = 0:72 and a = 0:56, respectively. The collimation break\noccurs about one order smaller than the Bondi radius at  3:8  105 rs. This\ncase is dierent from the M87 jet where the collimation break was found near\nthe Bondi radius. The closer transition of the jet is to the SMBH means that\nthe jet is not well collimated. This may be caused by the low accretion rate,\nlow jet power, and the low intergalactic medium in the environment of M84.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Elika Prameswari": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/225706"}, "Penulis": "Elika Prameswari [10317040]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Taufiq Hidajat, DEA"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Astronomi", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Jet collimation, M84, radio galaxy", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "16 Jun 2021"}
