The \nefficiency of productivity increase depends on the quality of the hydraulic fracturing design, thus selecting the \nbest design is crucial. This study presents an integrated hydraulic fracturing design that maximizes well \nproduction and long-term economics using an enhanced design methodology. In this study, an integrated design \nmethodology is used to select the most efficient fracture design using numerical simulation. The fracture is \nsimulated by considering the available data. Then, the fracture-profile developed is processed further to \nforecast the deliverability increase and so the economics, by performing sensitivity analysis on several design \nparameters, the design that yield the most reliable fracture profile while giving the highest profit-to-expenditure \nratio is chosen, and later calibrated by using pressure-response data obained during the hydraulic fracturing \ntreatment. Presented case study shows the integrated design methodology is capable and successfully improve \nthe design selection that results in highest quality increase with given conditions. \nThis study suggests that performing an enhanced design method is a crucial part of selecting the hydraulic \nfracturing design to maximize the performance and the economics of the wells. The advantage of the enhanced \nmethodology is in the improved simulation and forecasting accuracy that results in overall increase in the \ndesign performance.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Muhammad Ihsan Aljabbar": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/223981"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Ihsan Aljabbar [12212068]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Silvya Dewi Rahmawati, S.Si., M.Si., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "production enhancement, hydraulic fracturing, design optimization, gas reservoir, economics", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "16 Apr 2021"}
