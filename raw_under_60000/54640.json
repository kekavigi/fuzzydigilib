Beside being used as fuel, natural gas is also utilized as raw material for petrochemical industries to produce several derivatve products. Natural gas can also be compressed or altered to liquid phase by decreasing the temperature below its condensing point in order to deliver it to the customer without constructing a new costly pipeline. There are some gas utilization routes that makes economical reviewis needed to guide the investors in deciding the most profitable project which can be developed.\nIn this study, the steps to determine the most economically optimum route in utilizing the produced gas from \u201dW\u201d Field are discussed and done using GasRoutesCalculator software that does the forward calculation method. The price of the final product is also analyzed to screen the product that can be sold below the market price so it can be profitably offered to the buyer. Economical parameter such as NPV is then used to decide the most profitable route to be developed. Sensitivity studies are being done to determine the IRR of the choosen gas utilization route. Other parameters such as CAPEX, OPEX, and the gas purchasing price are also reviewed to see their impact to the NPV dan final product price.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Anggara Putra Bagustama": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/224032"}, "Penulis": "Anggara Putra Bagustama [12212069]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
