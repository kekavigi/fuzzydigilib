{"Nomor": 54619, "Judul": "PTSSIM, A NEW SOFTWARE FOR GEOTHERMAL WELL FEEDZONE  SIMULATION", "Abstrak": "Determining the location of feedzone(s) and its contribution to the well is very important for designing the production facilities to be installed. PTSSIM is a new software developed in Visual Studio 2015 using Visual Basic language that help engineer in simulating the characteristic of feedzone(s) in geothermal well. It is intended to model fluid flow contributed from feedzone(s) in a geothermal well by solving pressure and temperature profile of liquid, vapor, and two-phase water against measured data from production or shut-in logging. PTSSIM is used to perform top-down PTS production and shut-in logging simulations for vertical wells by defining the wellhead and the parameters of feedzone(s) and well-geometry specifications. This software enables a graphical user interface, deliver output curve predictions using discharge test simulations and the parameterrs feedzone(s) and also give options of two correlations related to two-phase flow to be used for simulation. Validation of PTSSIM was conducted by simulating observed PTS data and by comparing simulation result from PTSSIM against simulation result from previous study.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Yuzar Aryadi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/223955"}, "Penulis": "Yuzar Aryadi [12212080]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr.Eng.
