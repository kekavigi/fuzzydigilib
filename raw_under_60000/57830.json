{"Nomor": 57830, "Judul": "MANUFACTURE AND TESTING OF SIX BAR LINKAGE BIONIC HAND WITH ADJUSTABLE SOCKET FOR TRANSRADIAL AMPUTEE", "Abstrak": "Over 21 million people in Indonesia experience some form of disability. Reduced limb function is one of the common types of physical disability. This includes people with a physical impairment or reduced mobility which may include the hand. The bionic hand serves as a solution to substitute the function of the hand. The Biomechanics Research Team (BRT) ITB has conducted bionic hand research since 2017. In previous research, a bionic hand with 7 selected grasp patterns with a customized socket for a transradial amputee has been successfully made. However, urgent improvement of the socket should be made along with a thorough analysis on the performance of the device.\nManufacture of the device is done based on the design concept made from the constructed design requirement and objectives. The six-bar linkage bionic hand with surface electromyography as the muscle signal detector equipped with an adjustable socket to fit for a specified range of dimension of arm has been tested for a transradial amputee and has reached a technology readiness level of 6. This research is aimed to serve as an initial stage in mass production of an affordable bionic hand with adjustable socket in Indonesia.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Zithri Sitepu": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/231634"}, "Penulis": "Zithri Sitepu [13117232]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
