{"Nomor": 56117, "Judul": "INFILL WELL LOCATION SELECTION USING PRODUCTIVE OIL ZONE DATA ANALYSIS WITH MACHINE LEARNING", "Abstrak": "It has been known that infill drilling can increase oil and gas recovery by accelerating oil and gas production\nbecause most reservoirs in the real world are not homogeneous. With the increase in energy demand and the rise\nin oil and natural gas prices, more and more oil fields around the world are undergoing infill drilling. For most\nconventional oil reservoirs, numerical simulation can successfully predict and extract valuable information about\nthe optimal location of a new well. However, due to the particularity of the reservoir, the numerical simulation\nresults in some cases were not successful.\nMachine learning (ML) has received attention recently because it does not require a specific physical model, but\nif there is enough data, it can provide good estimates. Due to its feature, ML has strong applicability in Field X.\nThe method used in this study allows operators to identify the best location for infill drilling to optimize well\nplacement and additionally helps operators benefit from their previously gathered knowledge in a cost-effective\nway.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Ramatilla Wicky Prima Putri": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/227597"}, "Penulis": "Ramatilla Wicky Prima Putri [12217086]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Dedy Irawan, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Infill Well, Machine Learning, Voronoi diagram, Reservoir engineering.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Jun 2021"}
