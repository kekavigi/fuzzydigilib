{"Nomor": 50908, "Judul": "ANALYSIS OF BUILD BACK BETTER (BBB) FRAMEWORK IMPLEMENTATION FOCUS ON RISK REDUCTION ASPECT FOR HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION AT DUYU URBAN VILLAGE, PALU CITY, CENTRAL SULAWESI PROVINCE", "Abstrak": "Building Back Better (BBB) is a complete recovery framework which has aim to\nrebuild community, environment, and infrastructure better than previous in order to\ndiminish the vulnerability that exist earlier. Study by Sandeeka Mannakara in 2014\ncreates framework for BBB during post-disaster situation in reconstruction and\nrecovery consists of three main categories 1) Risk Reduction; 2) Community\nRecovery; and 3) Implementation. My research will focus on risk reduction with\nthe improvement on structural design and land-use planning principle. These two\nprinciples are crucial due to its role as tools for creating better livelihood for\ncommunity while government has full responsibility in regulating them.\nIndonesia, as member of Sendai Framework Risk Reduction has mandatory to\nundertake and develop BBB framework as post Disaster Risk Management.\nConsequently, government of Indonesia integrated this concept into Disaster\nPrevention Masterplan (Rencana Induk Penanggulangan Bencana/ RIPB 2015-\n2045) with mission Indonesia Resilient to Disaster for Supporting Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals. However, there is no detail guideline for applying and\nmeasuring this framework into action since it is a new concept in Indonesia while\nalso government still not have multi-hazard assessment for risk reduction.\nThe occurrence of 7.5 magnitude earthquake and tsunami in Central Sulawesi on\n28 September 2018 resulting 2,045 fatalities, 20,679 injuries, and 67,310 houses\ndamaged with Palu city as the most affected area. In line with RIPB, national\nauthority established Central Sulawesi rehabilitation and reconstruction masterplan\nby adopting build back better and safer concept. This research has an objective to\nanalyze the implementation of BBB framework focus on risk reduction aspect for\nhousing reconstruction process in Duyu urban village, Palu post disaster area using\nscale and index method, overlay analysis, and comparative study analysis.iv\nThe result shows that the implementation of risk reduction as part of build back\nbetter framework for housing reconstruction in Duyu, Palu post disaster area fall\ninto moderate level even though some indicators still poorly implemented. While\nfor the spatial planning in Duyu, unfortunately this area stand on disaster prone zone\nmoderate level (ZRB2) with high soil vulnerability. This result indicates Duyu\nhousing reconstruction process has gone through analysis and consideration for risk\nreduction practice that involves five variables (building codes and regulation; cost\nand time; quality; risk based zone; and resettlement) by adopting build back better\nframework in order to create resilience community towards future disaster.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Ayu Erlinna": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/213700", "BAB 1 Ayu Erlinna": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/213701", "BAB 2 Ayu Erlinna": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/213702", "BAB 3 Ayu Erlinna": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/213703", "BAB 4 Ayu Erlinna": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/213704", "BAB 5 Ayu Erlinna": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/213705", "BAB 6 Ayu Erlinna": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/213706", "DAFTAR Ayu Erlinna": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/213707", "2020 TS PP AYU ERLINNA_LAMPIRAN.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/213708"}, "Penulis": "Ayu Erlinna [25418024]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
