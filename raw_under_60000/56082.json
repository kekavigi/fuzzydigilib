Sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in depleted oil and gas reservoirs is an\nimmediate, cost-effective option to reduce CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. The development model of CO2\nsequestration is the element implemented in the contract. Therefore, it is necessary to perform evaluation and\nresearch to make CO2 sequestration technically and economically feasible.\nFor the technical aspect analysis, a reservoir simulation is executed in a depleted gas field for 30 years of\nCO2 injection. This simulation study is completed using a 3-D compositional simulator \"ECLIPSE 300\" to forecast\nthe performance of CO2 storage capacity. In addition, several injection rate sensitivity was conducted to find\ninjection rate effects on the storage capacity and financial performance. The economic analysis takes into account\nfactors such as storage and transportation cost. The analysis of the economic model contract for CO2 sequestration\nrefers to the existing oil and gas contract model in Indonesia, which is Production Sharing Contract (PSC) Cost\nrecovery and Modification of PSC Gross Split. The modification of PSC to evaluate the economic CO2\nsequestration project is preferred since it is more acceptable for the government and investors.\nBased on technical analysis, a series of injection rate sensitivity explained the best scenario for CO2\nsequestration. The scenario 60 MMSCFD injection rate was chosen as the best scenario because of its 16 years\nplateau time. This scenario continues with the economic calculation and study sensitivity for several fiscal\nparameters to find the most profitable model contract for CO2 sequestration in the depleted gas reservoir. The\nCost Recovery model provides better economic returns for contractors. Economic sensitivity shows that several\nparameters such as CO2 price, amount of CO2 injection, and CAPEX have a considerable influence on the\neconomy.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Kharisma Asri Yasmin": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/227542", "2021 TA PP KHARISMA ASRI YASMIN 1.pdf]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/229044"}, "Penulis": "Kharisma Asri Yasmin [12217039]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Dedy Irawan, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "CO2 sequestration, Net Zero-Emission, PSC Model Modification", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Jun 2021"}
