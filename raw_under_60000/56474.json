{"Nomor": 56474, "Judul": "USER INTERFACE (UI) DESIGN FOR MACHINING PROCESS PLANNING", "Abstrak": "Globalization that has occurred in the past few years, has bring significant impact in\ntechnological development. Many countries competing each other to strengthen their\neconomic power and use advanced technology to enlarge the market scope and therefore they\ncan get more profits. Manufacturing plays a huge role in the case of improving the economic\npower, it is also known as the key element in the wealth of nations. Therefore, a country or\ncompany that possess advanced technology implement in their manufacturing system has the\nbigger chance to win the competition. A Machining Process Planning User Interface system,\nwith features that can provide automatically the type of machine tool, cutting tool, and cutting\ncondition based on the selected machining process type, also the system that are able to\nestimate the cutting time of a machining process, was build and hoping this will help to\nachieve these goals.\nThe design process of the Machining Process Planning User Interface begins with the\ndesign requirement and objective of this user interface program. Then study literature\nregarding the process planning approaches, machining processes, machine tools, cutting tools\nand cutting parameters. Then proceed with collecting data for types of machining process,\ntypes of machine tools, types of cutting tools, type of materials, and suitable cutting\nconditions. After all the data required are collected, the user interface for machining process\nplanning build using web application method, with the help of Django web framework.\nThe designed user interface is completed and successfully achieved the specified\nobjective. The system able to provide features that can automatically select the type of the\nmachine tool, cutting tool, and provide suitable cutting conditions also estimate the cutting\ntime.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Rahadian Yusuf Prakoso": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/228437"}, "Penulis": "Rahadian Yusuf Prakoso [13116203]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
