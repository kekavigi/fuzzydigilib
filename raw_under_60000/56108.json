{"Nomor": 56108, "Judul": "ANALYSIS OF INTERFACIAL TENSION CHANGES IN ADDITION OF NANO-SILICA FOR SURFACTANT INJECTION USING SYNTHETIC OIL", "Abstrak": "Chemical enhanced oil recovery methods are applied to change both fluid and rock characteristics therefore, oil can be produced. Surfactant injection is the most common chemical enhanced oil recovery technique due to mobilizing trapped residual oil in porous media. Currently, nanotechnology has been applied in oil and gas industry, especially EOR methods. However, less research on the utilization of nanoparticles for surfactant injection was reported. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the influences of nano-silica on interfacial tension changes for surfactant injection using synthetic oil. Nano-silica and surfactant were performed to enhance oil recovery by conducting phase behavior test and interfacial tension measurement. The results showed that addition of nano-silica for surfactant injection has ability to decrease interfacial tension. The outcomes of this study can be used as a laboratory study and hence may be applicable for the future prospect in oil field.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Zenitzya Virgia": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/227588"}, "Penulis": "Zenitzya Virgia [12217073]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Rani Kurnia, S.Si., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "enhanced oil recovery, surfactant, nano-silica, phase behavior, interfacial tension", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Jun 2021"}
