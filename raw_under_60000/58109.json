{"Nomor": 58109, "Judul": "INVESTIGATION OF INTERACTIONS BETWEEN TWO MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES AND SARS VIRUS WITH A LABEL-FREE PROTEIN ARRAY", "Abstrak": "The investigation of interactions between two\nkinds of monoclonal antibodies and SARS virus with a labelfree\nprotein array technique were presented in this paper. The\nperformance consists of three parts: a surface modification for\nligand immobilization/surface, a protein array fabrication with\nan integrated microfluidic system for patterning, packaging\nand liquid handling, and a protein array reader of imaging\nellipsometer. This revealed the technique could be used as an\nimmunoassay for qualitative and quantitative detection as well\nas kinetic analysis of biomolecule interaction.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "C.
