{"Nomor": 57321, "Judul": "MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF ORGANICALLY CROSS-LINKED POLYMER GELATION TIME TO EOR APPLICATION", "Abstrak": "Increasing of demand in oil products definitely causes an improvement in oil depletion method\nincludes the using of chemical EOR (Enhance Oil Recovery) for instance polymer injection to\nwater shut-off treatment. A recent EOR technology has reported that the utilization of\norganically cross-linked polymer can be synthesized and revealing more stable and stronger\nbonding rather than commercially well-known heavy metal cross linking agent like Cr(III).\nHeavy metal bonds the polymer structure with a coordinative-covalent bond which is not\nstrongly linked. Less strong bond reflects a possibility of released polymer bonding which leads\nto an environmentally harmful state since it is composed by a heavy metal. Considering the\nused concentration of each reactant, it reveals by adding only 0.2% to 3.0% of weight can obtain\na reasonable gelation time. By using previous experimental data from Sengupta et al. (2011), a\nhandy-mathematical model is then analytically developed and proposed to study the\nphenomenon of gelation time to polymer system consisted of polyacrylamide, hexamethylene\ntetramine and hydroquinone at pH = 8.0. Basic theory is developed based on reaction rate\nequation and Arrhenius\u2019 Law. Through a multivariable regression method which is done with\nhelp of computer, a proposed model deals with a good agreement in its R-square value (?\n0.93361) and by comparing the theoretical and experimental gelation time. This equation can\nthen be beneficial to adjust a desired polymer system behavior and be a profile modification\njob in the oil field according to enhanced oil recovery application. It also predicts the duration\nof polymer solution should be being injected to the reservoir, when a well can be produced after\ntreatment and how much substance to be spent. Thus, modification and prediction through this\nformula can finally contribute to optimize such as price and time of a green water shut-off\ntreatment.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Farizal Hakiki [12210024]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Pudjo Sukarno"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Mathematical model, Gelation time, Organic polymer, Chemical EOR, WSO", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Agu 2021"}
