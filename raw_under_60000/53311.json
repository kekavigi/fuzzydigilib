{"Nomor": 53311, "Judul": "BREAST HISTOPATHOLOGICAL IMAGE RETRIEVAL BASED ON LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION", "Abstrak": "In the field of pathology, whole slide image\n(WSI) has become the major carrier of visual and diagnostic\ninformation. Content-based image retrieval among\nWSIs can aid the diagnosis of an unknown pathological image\nby finding its similar regions in WSIs with diagnostic\ninformation. However, the huge size and complex content\nof WSI pose several challenges for retrieval. In this paper,\nwe propose an unsupervised, accurate, and fast retrieval\nmethod for a breast histopathological image. Specifically,\nthe method presents a local statistical feature of nuclei for\nmorphology and distribution of nuclei, and employs the Gabor\nfeature to describe the texture information. The latent\nDirichlet allocation model is utilized for high-level semantic\nmining. Locality-sensitive hashing is used to speed up the\nsearch. Experiments on a WSI database with more than 8000\nimages from 15 types of breast histopathology demonstrate\nthat our method achieves about 0.9 retrieval precision as\nwell as promising efficiency. Based on the proposed framework,\nwe are developing a search engine for an online digital\nslide browsing and retrieval platform, which can be applied\nin computer-aided diagnosis, pathology education, and WSI\narchiving and management.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yibing Ma [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zhiguo Jiang, Member, IEEE, Haopeng Zhang, Member, IEEE, Fengying Xie, Yushan Zheng, Huaqiang Shi, and Yu Zhao"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Index Terms\u2014Content-based image retrieval (CBIR), latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), local statistical feature of nuclei (LSFN), whole slide image (WSI).", "Sumber": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "03 Mar 2021"}
