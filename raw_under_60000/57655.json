Mapan has a service called Mapan Arisan that provides a five months installment for members through our Mitra Usaha Mapan that will create an Arisan group. Each member can choose the household product in our catalog then they will pay the installment each month to the Mitra Usaha Mapan that create the group. Mitra Usaha Mapan will send the money to our system through GoPay.\nDuring pandemic situations we see that the purchasing power of our members is decreasing due to their financial limitations. However, we also see that there are several competitors that have similar systems like Mapan Arisan, which has started rising in Indonesia and can acquire members. This final project aims to analyze Mapan's position in the market, also behavior of our Mitra and members so we can generate strategies for Mapan\u2019s business and marketing especially to adapt in pandemic situations.\n\nIn exploring the business issue, we use both primary and secondary data. Beside some literature, we also get information from Mapan\u2019s research team regarding the internal data that is mostly gathered by quantitative approach. To get more comprehensive insight, in this research we focus on using a qualitative approach, then we have conducted sixteen interviews that include eight Mitra and eight members across Java and Bali. \nThrough the analysis that we have, we see there are several things that must be developed by Mapan related with product option and installment period to compete with current Arisan\u2019s player. Mapan also needs to fix their promotion method and content to help Mitra promote Arisan to their members. In order to handle this issue, we propose three solution points for Mapan; competing through strong differentiation, handling agent with more solution-based value, and effective marketing communication through promotion.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Gabriela Cornelia Londa": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/262069", "BAB 1 Gabriela Cornelia Londa": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/262070", "BAB 2 Gabriela Cornelia Londa": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/262071", "BAB 3 Gabriela Cornelia Londa": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/262072", "BAB 4 Gabriela Cornelia Londa": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/262073", "PUSTAKA Gabriela Cornelia Londa": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/262074"}, "Penulis": "Gabriela Cornelia Londa [29319428]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Jacob Silas Mussry"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Administrasi Bisnis", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Perilaku Konsumen, Inisiatif Pemasaran, Situasi Pandemi.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Roosalina Vanina Viyazza", "File": "6 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Agu 2021"}
