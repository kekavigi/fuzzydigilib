One of the\nfamous genus plants that have been used as herb immunomodulator is Echinacea. Echinacea\npurpurea, Echinacea pallida, and Echinacea angustifolia are the species which known has\nimmunomodulator activity. E. purpurea is the most commonly used commercially that has proven\nthe activity of this species. Otherwise, E. pallida has the least studied especially in the activity and\ntoxicity. Cannabinoid receptors are the receptors that can bind to E. pallida compound to give\nphysiological activity. In silico was used as the preliminary method to predict the interaction and\nalso the toxicity of E. pallida compound with Cannabinoid receptor 1. Therefore, this research\naimed to predict and analyze the binding energy and interaction of E. pallida as immunomodulator\nvia docking and predict the possible toxicity. The crystal structure of CB1 and AM11542 native\nligand was obtained from Protein Data Bank with PDB ID is 5XRA. This crystal structure was\nredocked using Autodock 4.2.3. Thirty compounds of E. pallida and Endocannabinoid as comparison\ncompound were prepared using GaussView 5.0 and Gaussian 09W software. Then, the docking\nprocesses were conducted for test ligand and comparison compound using Autodock 4.2.3 with\ngrid box size (63x63x63) and central of coordinate was (-43.617, 164.787, 306.921). The toxicity\npredication of E. pallida compound was done using VEGA 1.1.5 Beta 22 software. Based on the\nresults, Cyanidin 3-(6\u201d-malonylglucoside) (-40.92 kJ/mol), 4,5-O-Dicaffeoylquinic acid (-42.43\nkJl/mol), Verbascoside (-42.84 kJ/mol), 3,5-O-Dicaffeoylquinic acid (-45.77 kJ/mol), and Echinacin (-\n51.51 kJ/mol) were the strongest test compound bind with CB1R with the lowest binding energy.\nHowever, Echinacin were predicted to have carcinogenic and hepatotoxicity activity and contribute\nto ecotoxicity. Thus, further research on safe concentration for human as well as for the\nenvironment needed to be done.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Ade Yulina Mursyidah Saad": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/213446"}, "Penulis": "Ade Yulina Mursyidah Saad [11616106]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Benny Permana, S.Si., M.Si., Ph.D.", "Dr. apt.
