{"Nomor": 57873, "Judul": "CRM APPLICATION FOR INVESTIGATION STUDY OF VISCOSITY DIFFERENCE EFFECT IN KOVAL MODEL ANALYSIS OF POLYMER INJECTION", "Abstrak": "There are many ways to increase oil recovery in old fields, one of which is using the EOR method. Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) is one way to increase oil production yields by injecting a fluid into the injection well into the reservoir to push oil into the production well. In this study, reservoir simulations were made using polymer injection as the EOR fluid. Furthermore, the viscosity of the polymer is varied to see how the effect of the resulting oil production. This simulation is carried out using the Capacitance Resistance Model (CRM) method where this method is easy to do and requires a short time to perform the simulation. Furthermore, to determine the oil flow rate, the oil fraction model was used. The oil fraction model used is the Koval Model. The Koval model was chosen because it can be applied to various water saturation conditions by taking into account the heterogeneity of the reservoir layer permeability and also the effect of viscosity. Therefore this study was made to show the relationship between the Coval Model and the viscosity of the injected polymer and also to compare it with waterflood injection.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK M.
