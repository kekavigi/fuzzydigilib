{"Nomor": 53768, "Judul": "FLOW MODELING ON A MULTI-PHASED MULTI FEED ZONE GEOTHERMAL WELL USING HARRISON-FREESTON METHOD", "Abstrak": "An idle production well is produced from two different characteristic multi-feed zones (steam and water), has been in operation for several years to supply steam to one of the geothermal plants. The well with multi-feed zone has been experiencing an irregular competing phenomenon, in which this phenomenon is causing the wellhead pressure and productivity resulting in an inconstant/vary value. At the same time, the flow control valves are set to constant.\nThe competing phenomenon is affected by an inconstant change of pressure-between reservoir-wellbore, where the steam feed zone underlying at the upper part of the brine part, causing the brine to be slower on early production, since the steam\u2019s zone is above the brine\u2019. After a duration of time, the wellbore pressure becomes lesser by the time goes on, causing the well to begin to produce from the water feed zone and blocks the steam feed zone instead, and so on competing for each feed zones.\nTo understand more of this irregular phenomenon, a design and evaluation of the fluid flow in the well has to firstly be done, desiring an analytic view of the flow within well production by adjusting the sensitivity of the wellbore production side, based on the deliverability output curve and chart depths thought the wellbore. The sensitivity adjustment is done on several parameters, such as the variety of productivity index of each feed zones, changes in reservoir pressure and temperature in feed zones according to the well data, and varies of enthalpy irregularly produced. Then, the result of the model can be judged for the optimum solutions, or responses for optimizing the studies on the competing phenomenon.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Farid Mulki Antoni": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/221415"}, "Penulis": "Farid Mulki Antoni [12216086]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dimas Taha Maulana, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "competing phenomenon, multi-feed zones, deliverability curve", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Mar 2021"}
