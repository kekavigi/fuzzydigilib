The company is curently running  its latest project to enter\nthe business in the field of Augmented Reality (AR) and AI-Powered Virtual Assistant\n(Chatbot) as technology that is becoming a trend in the industrial era 4.0.

Not only technology-based research,\nbusiness research is also carried out in an effort to meet consumer needs and be able to\ndetermine the right market share. However, the Digital Service Division (DDS),\nespecially those located in the Bandung operational area, is experiencing problems.\nNamely, the project objective was not achieved which at the end of 2019 would launch a\nprototype. This is due to the lack of competence of the talents who are working on this\nproject, and Telkom DDS also does not have a specific framework related to the\ncompetencies needed in the effort to complete AR and Chatbot projects.\nThe purpose of this research is to formulate an appropriate competency model related to\nthe Augmented Reality and Chatbot projects currently being worked on by the Telkom\nDigital Service Division. Furthermore, the proposed competency model will form the\nbasis for Human Resources planning for Telkom Bandung's Ditial Service Division in its\nefforts to work on this project. The research method used is qualitative through interviews\nand direct observation within the company, and quantitative by taking data through a\nquestionnaire of 30 respondents. Validity and reliability tests are used to determine\nwhether the question item is appropriate to be used as a dimension in developing a\ncompetency model or not.\nBy creating a competency model, the Digital Service Division of Telkom Bandung can\nfind out what competencies their talents must have in relation to working on AR and\nChatbot projects. Furthermore, the competency model can be used as a basis for\nrecruitment, training and development programs, as well as assessment for talents within\nthe company.", "Daftar File": {"2020_TS_PP_Pujianto Chandra _1-Abstrak.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/213092"}, "Penulis": "Pujianto Chandra [29118451]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Andika Putra Pratama, M.S.M., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Magister Bisnis dan Administrasi - Teknologi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Subjek": "General management", "Kata Kunci": "modal insani, layanan digital", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yose Ali Rahman", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Sep 2020"}
