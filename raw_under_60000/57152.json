{"Nomor": 57152, "Judul": "DESAIN VAKSIN MULTI-EPITOP BAKTERI CHLAMYDIA TRACHOMATIS SEROVAR D DARI PROTEIN MEMBRAN LUAR MENGGUNAKAN PENDEKATAN REVERSE VACCINOLOGY", "Abstrak": "Chlamydia trachomatis is a Gram-negative intracellular obligate bacteria known to be the leading\ncauses of sexually transmitted diseases in the world. Chlamydial infections could lead to serious\nhealth complications such as pelvic inflammation, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility.\nUnfortunately, most infections are usually asymptomatic and there have been found various\nantibiotic resistance cases. Vaccination is deemed as one of the best approaches to reduce\nchlamydial infection prevalence rather than screening or treatment with antibiotics. Up until now,\nno chlamydial vaccine is available. On the other hand, C. trachomatis outer membranes have been\nknown to induce immune reaction. Therefore, in this study an attempt is made to design a vaccine\nfrom outer membrane using reverse vaccinology approach. Protein sequences collected from\nNCBI, and then followed with Multiple Sequence Alignment to determine epitope fragment\ncandidates. CTL, HTL, and B cell epitope identification were done using different servers namely\nNetCTL v1.2, NetMHCII v2.3, and iBCE-EL, respectively. 3D structure of the vaccine candidate\nwas predicted using trRosetta server, refined using GalaxyRefine server, and validated using Zscore,\nERRAT score, and Ramachandran plot analysis. Molecular docking analysis between\nvaccine and TLR-1/2 and TLR-4 as well as between epitope and MHC molecules were done using\nClusPro 2.0 server and GalaxyPepDock server, respectively. Finally, codon optimization and\ninsertion into plasmid to make sure an efficient cloning and expression were done using JCat server\nand SnapGene application, respectively. Based on in silico analysis, a 270aa multi-epitope vaccine\ncandidate was successfully designed and constructed. The vaccine consists of 9 CTL epitopes, and\n2 HTL and B cell epitopes. Vaccine\u2019s 3D structure was validated as good based on Ramachandran\nfavoured score, Z-score, and ERRAT score all fall between the accepted range which were 95%,\n-6.73, and 80.75, respectively. Molecular docking analysis showed that interaction between\nvaccine candidate and TLR molecules and between epitopes and MHC molecules can all occur\nspontaneously (energetically feasible). Lastly, codon sequence optimization and insertion into\nplasmid showed that vaccine could be expressed using E. coli K12 and CAI score 1. Vaccine\ncandidate identified in this study has shown to be a potential vaccine to induce specific, both B\ncell and T cells, immune reaction to prevent chlamydial infection and its quality can be evaluated\nin the future in clinical as well as pre-clincal studies.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Felix Hojaya": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/229758"}, "Penulis": "Felix Hojaya [10417010]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Azzania Fibriani, S.Si., M.Si., Ph.D.", "Husna Nugrahapraja, S.Si., M.Si., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Mikrobiologi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Ilmu dan Teknologi Hayati", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "B cell epitope, Chlamydia trachomatis, multi-epitope vaccine, reverse vaccinology, T cell epitope.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Jul 2021"}
