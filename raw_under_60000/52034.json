{"Nomor": 52034, "Judul": "SOLID DYNAMICS SIMULATION USING TOTAL LAGRANGIAN FORMULATION WITH SPH AND DC PSE", "Abstrak": "Discretization correction particle strength exchange or DC PSE is a particlebased\ndiscretization operator. In the last few years, DC PSE not only implemented\nin fluids dynamics but also in structure simulation. In this thesis,\nDC PSE will be used in solid dynamics simulation replacing SPH that already\ndone by (Wiragunarsa, 2019) in 2019.\nPractically, there is a stabilisation issue when DC PSE is used to solve momentum\nequation, therefore, momentum equation has to solved using SPH and\nDC PSE only used to solve deformation gradient tensor equation. However,\nthe existence of DC PSE has a good effect on the simulation compared to only\nusing standard SPH, it can be seen from both kernel testing.\nIn this thesis, the simulation code that has been made, is used to performs\nsimulation in two dimensional and three dimensional cases, which will be compared\nto analytical result and another previous simulation results. The simulated\ncases include geometrically nonlinear bending analysis (Lin et al., 2015),\nfree vibration (Inman and Singh, 1994), and twist angle of rectangular column\nwith torsion load (Young, Budynas, Sadegh, et al., 2002). .", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Ahmad Humaedi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/217660", "COVER Ahmad Humaedi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/232610", "BAB 6 Ahmad Humaedi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/232616", "PUSTAKA Ahmad Humaedi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/232617"}, "Penulis": "Ahmad Humaedi [23618022]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Lavi Rizki Zuhal"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "DC PSE, SPH, Solid dynamics simulation", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "9 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Jan 2021"}
