{"Nomor": 54877, "Judul": "PREDICTING CT IMAGE FROM MRI DATA THROUGH FEATURE MATCHING WITH LEARNED NONLINEAR LOCAL DESCRIPTORS", "Abstrak": "Attenuation correction for positron-emission\ntomography (PET)/magnetic resonance(MR) hybridimaging\nsystems and dose planning for MR-based radiation therapy\nremain challenging due to insufficient high-energy photon\nattenuation information. We present a novel approach that\nuses the learned nonlinear local descriptors and feature\nmatching to predict pseudo computed tomography (pCT)\nimages from T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) data. The nonlinear local descriptors\nare obtained by projecting the linear descriptors into the\nnonlinear high-dimensional space using an explicit feature\nmap and low-rank approximation with supervised manifold\nregularization. The nearest neighbors of each local descriptor\nin the input MR images are searched in a constrained\nspatial range of the MR images among the training dataset.\nThen the pCT patches are estimated through-nearest neighbor\nregression. The proposed method for pCT prediction\nis quantitatively analyzed on a dataset consisting of paired\nbrain MRI and CT images from 13 subjects. Our method\ngenerates pCT images with a mean absolute error (MAE)\nof 75.25 \u00b1 18.05 Hounsfield units, a peak signal-to-noise\nratio of 30.87 \u00b1 1.15 dB, a relative MAE of 1.56 \u00b1 0.5% in\nPET attenuation correction, and a dose relative structure\nvolume difference of 0.055 \u00b1 0.107% in D98%, as compared\nwith true CT. The experimental results also show that our\nmethod outperforms four state-of-the-art methods.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Wei Yang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Liming Zhong, Yang Chen , Liyan Lin, Zhentai Lu, Shupeng Liu, Yao Wu, Qianjin Feng"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "prediction, nonlinear descriptor, lowrank approximation, KNN regression, PET attenuation correction.", "Sumber": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING, VOL. 37, NO. 4, APRIL 2018", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Jun 2021"}
