{"Nomor": 53740, "Judul": "PARETO OPTIMAL TRACING APPROACH FOR ROBUST MULTI-OBJECTIVE STRUCTURAL TOPOLOGY OPTIMIZATION", "Abstrak": "This thesis presents a robust multi-objective approach for structural topology optimization.\nPerformance and stability of a design are two conflicting objectives,\nhence, sometimes it is preferable to treat them as multiple objectives to gain important\ninsights regarding various optimal topologies. The optimization problem\nis formulated as a simultaneous minimization of expectation and standard deviation\nof compliance in the presence of uncertainties in loading direction or loading\nmagnitude. It is imperative to obtain a good representation of the Pareto front\nwith as few finite element simulations as possible. This thesis proposes the combination\nof topology optimization with Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) and\nPareto Optimal Tracing (POT) to seek diverse Pareto optimal solutions efficiently.\nThree test cases, i.e., cantilever beam, simply supported beam and distributed\nload on carrier plate problem are used to test efficacy of the proposed method\nand the results are compared to the deterministic optimization. In distributed\nload problem, a new challange arises to deal with large number of random variables\nand therefore Gaussian random field is constructued by a Karhunen-Loeve\nExpansion paremeterization to reduce the random variables dimension. Thus,\nthe impact of the PCE to reduce the number of realizations and POT to reduce\nthe number of iterations are studied on the estimation of the Pareto front with\nvarious combinations of weights assigned to the expectation and the standard deviation.\nIn addition, several non-dominating robust solutions are also validated\nusing Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS). Results show that robust topology optimization\nwith POT and PCE yielded better and more diverse topologies than the\nconventional approach, which restart the search from the baseline design.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Nathan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/221385"}, "Penulis": "Nathan [23619014]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Lavi Rizki Zuhal", "Pramudita Satria Palar, S.T., M.T., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "karhunen-loeve expansion, monte carlo simulations, pareto optimal tracing, polynomial chaos expansion, topology optimization", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Mar 2021"}
