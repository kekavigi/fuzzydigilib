{"Nomor": 57863, "Judul": "THE INFLUENCE OF CONFINEMENT EFFECT ON INITIAL GAS IN PLACE ESTIMATION & RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF BARNETT SHALE GAS RESERVOIR", "Abstrak": "Shale gas, as the one of unconventional gas reservoir, plays a critical role for fulfilling the fast rate of gas\nconsumption demand in the future, that values up to 1.4% increasing per year. However, both caracteristic and\nproduction method of this reservoir shows a particular complexity by itself to be analysed and extracted. It needs\nfurther study to help identifying the characteristic more comprehensively so that avoiding the mis-intepretation\nand mis-prediction at the end of the day that can lead to wrong determination on techno-economic analysis of\nshale gas development project. One of the unique of shale gas reservoir characteristic is about nano-pore system\nwhich leads to unique phase behaviour under confinement effect. Therefore, the effects of nano-pores on the\ncritical properties of the confined gas in the Barnett Shale will be investigated. This study focuses on analysis of\nfluid reservoir properties and phase envelope or critical properties shifting due to the confinement effect of several\nnano-pore sizes that are 2 nm, 4 nm, 6 nm, 8 nm, 15 nm, and 30 nm. Therefore, 7 models consist of 6 confinement\nand 1 unconfinement cases are built by the use of Peng-Robinson equation of the state (EOS). These models will\nbe as the fluid models for the input of reservoir simulation process through CMG- GEM simulator. Finally, after\nbuilding the reservoir models, many simulation runs were carried out in order to study the impact of the pore\nconfinement on the gas reservoir\u2019s performance. This study also focuses on different values calculation of shale\ngas reserve estimation by the use of Monte-Carlo method, based on the result of fluid reservoir properties analysis\nin different pore size. Monte Carlo\u2019s variables are set to be normal distribution except the gas formation volume\nfactor, that follows particular distribution of pore size distribution model on Barnett shale gas reservoir. Both\nstudies results that several gas properties such as gas formation volume factor, gas deviation factor, gas viscosity,\nand gas density show deflection along the pressure profile, compared to the conventional one on the same\ncompositional model. This deflection heads to little different of gas reservoir performance, such as different values\nup to 5 % on recovery factor and 2 % on cumulative gas production and also gives significant differences enough\nof gas initial in place estimation which is up to 11 % between conventional and the unconventional one. These\nresults show direct implications in determining the gas-in-place and assessing the production potential of a shale\ngas reservoir under various confinement scenario.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Anwar Santoso": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/231475"}, "Penulis": "Anwar Santoso [12217026]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
