{"Nomor": 54501, "Judul": "EXHAUST EMISSIONS FROM IN-USE MOTORCYCLES", "Abstrak": "The goal of the thesis was to characterize the emissions of regulated and basic unregulated pollutants from two in-use motorcycles. For each motorcycle, coast-down data were obtained on a suitable test track to determine the road losses, a chassis dynamometer was set to mimic the aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance and other losses, and an exhaust sampling system was installed to allow measurement of exhaust flow, concentrations of gaseous pollutants and key properties of particulate matter such as total particle number or particle size distribution.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Antonin Voldrich": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/222940", "COVER Antonin Voldrich": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/257089", "BAB 1 Antonin Voldrich": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/257090", "BAB 2 Antonin Voldrich": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/257091", "BAB 3 Antonin Voldrich": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/257092", "BAB 4 Antonin Voldrich": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/257093", "BAB 5 Antonin Voldrich": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/257094", "BAB 6 Antonin Voldrich": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/257095", "BAB 7 Antonin Voldrich": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/257096", "PUSTAKA Antonin Voldrich": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/257097"}, "Penulis": "Antonin Voldrich [23118708]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Satrio Wicaksono, S.T., M.Eng., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Mesin", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Emissions, motorcycles, pollutants, emissions testing, chassis dynamometer, coast-down testing, L-category vehicles, exhaust gas analysis", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "10 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Mar 2021"}
