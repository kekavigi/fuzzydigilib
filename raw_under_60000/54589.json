{"Nomor": 54589, "Judul": "EXACT CALCULATION OF NOISE MAPS AND G-FACTOR IN GRAPPA USING A K-SPACE ANALYSIS", "Abstrak": "Characterization of the noise distribution in\nmagnetic resonance images has multiple applications,\nincluding quality assurance and protocol optimization.\nNoise characterization is particularly important in the\npresence of parallel imaging acceleration with multi-coil\nacquisitions, where the noise distribution can contain\nsevere spatial heterogeneities. If the parallel imaging reconstruction\nis a linear process, an accurate noise analysis\ncan be carried out by taking into account the correlations\nbetween all the samples involved. However, for k-spacebased\ntechniques such as generalized autocalibrating partially\nparallel acquisition (GRAPPA), the exact analysis has\nbeen consideredcomputationallyprohibitive due to the very\nlarge size of the noise covariance matrices required to\ncharacterize the noise propagation from k-space to image\nspace. Previously proposed methods avoid this computational\nburden by formulating the GRAPPA reconstruction as\na pixel-wise linear operation performed in the image space.\nHowever, these methods are not exact in the presence of\nnon-uniform sampling of k-space (e.g., containing a calibration\nregion). For this reason, in this paper, we develop\nan accurate characterization of the noise distribution for\nself-calibrated parallel imaging in the presence of arbitrary\nCartesian sampling patterns. By exploiting the symmetries\nand separability in the noise propagation process, the proposed\nmethod is computationally efficient and does not\nrequire large matrices. Under the assumption of a fixed\nreconstruction kernel, this method provides the precise\ndistribution of the noise variance for each coil\u2019s image.\nThese coil-by-coil noise maps are subsequently combined\naccording to the coil combination approach used in image\nreconstruction, and therefore can be appliedwith both complex\ncoilcombination and root-sum-of-squaresapproaches.\nIn this paper, we present the proposed noise characterization\nmethod and compare it to previous techniques using\nMonte Carlo simulations as well as phantom acquisitions.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "I\u00f1aki Rabanillo [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Santiago Aja-Fern\u00e1ndez, Carlos Alberola-L\u00f3pez, and Diego Hernando"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Magnetic resonance imaging, noise estimation, non-stationarity noise, GRAPPA, parallel imaging, g-factor.", "Sumber": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "05 Apr 2021"}
