However, the high temperature of the reservoir in\nIndonesia causes high MMP which makes it more difficult to achieve miscible injection. One way to reduce\nMMP is by adding co-solvent to the injected CO2 with controlled composition. This study will focus on CO2\ninjection having Acetone as the co-solvent which implemented in \u201cB\u201d Structure at \u201cS\u201d Field.\nIn this study, there are two objectives. They are identifying the optimum composition of CO2-Acetone in\nreducing MMP and designing the production strategy of CO2-Acetone mixture injection in \"B\" Structure at \"S\"\nField to obtain the highest recovery faktor. A sensitivity study of the optimum composition of CO2-Acetone is\ndone to observe the effect of Acetone in reducing MMP. The sensitivity study is simulated using CMG\nWinpropTM. Various development scenarios are generated with the optimum composition as the composition of\ngas injected. The development scenarios are simulated using CMG GEMTM. From the simulation results, the\nperformance of the reservoir which generates the highest recovery could be identified.\nFrom the simulation result, Acetone is proven to reduce MMP in CO2-Acetone mixture injection. The optimum\ncomposition of CO2-Acetone in reducing MMP is 89% CO2 + 11% Acetone. The optimum composition could\nreduce MMP from 3859.56 psi to 2280.39 psi. By lowering MMP, miscible injection is possible to be done\nwithout exceeding fracture pressure. The fracture pressure is estimated to be 2800 psi. The simulation result\nshows that CO2-Acetone mixture injection could improve recovery factor up to 9% without infill well and 14%\nwith infill well.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Dicky Cuandi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/227563"}, "Penulis": "Dicky Cuandi [12217051]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
