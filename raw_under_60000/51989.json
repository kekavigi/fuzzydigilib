Indonesia?s oil production has been constantly decreasing since 1995 and has been dominated by primary and secondary recovery techniques, while tertiary recovery techniques have rarely been used. Although, Indonesia has tried the first trial of using the tertiary recovery techniques of CO2 injection at \u201cM\u201d field. Generally, oil / gas fields in Indonesia have the reservoir characteristics with low pressure and high temperature especially \u201cM\u201d field has the characteristic of light oil along with some challenges in optimizing oil recovery by CO2 injection method. These are the main focuses in this study.\nThis study discusses how the mechanisms occur to reach the optimum condition of proposing further CO2 injection with huff and puff method at M-14 well in \u201cM\u201d field based on the evaluation of the pilot project has been done earlier so that it is expected to become a pioneer of CO2 injection in fields with similar characteristics especially in Indonesia and can be applied in field scale in \u201cM\u201d field later. In achieving these objectives, evaluation of previous pilots should be undertaken such as subsurface and injection well evaluation, validation of existing models (CMG GEM commercial simulator of homogeneous, cylindrical, single well model) with history matching, lessons learned from pilot project already done for future CO2 injection on the \"M\" field and simulation study with several case scenarios by huff and puff method.\nThe result of the simulation study shows that the optimum condition to propose the amount of CO2 to be injected with the assumption of 2000 tons is the proposed scenario of injection rate of 10 tons / day with the injection time for 198 days and the soaking time of 270 days in 1 cycle. This optimum condition will result in an increase of cumulative oil production of 6528 STB or an increase in recovery factor of 11.4% and the use of CO2 to increase each barrel of its oil by 5,453 MSCF / STB. On the other hand, when compared to the results of simulation studies with pilot project that have been done also showed that the increase in cumulative oil production is greater by changing the rate of injection and cycle based on the optimum condition obtained. Therefore, the CO2 injection method shows encouraging results in increasing the oil recovery.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Rido [12214031]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
