{"Nomor": 56280, "Judul": "THERMAL BEHAVIOUR AND THE COMBUSTION KINETICS OF HYBRID COALS BASED ON ITS THERMOGRAVIMETRIC ANALYSIS", "Abstrak": "In 2019, Indonesia produced 616 Mt of coal. However, most of the coal types in Indonesia\nconsists of lower rank coal which, when burned produces a large amount of carbon\ndioxide and produces less energy compared to higher rank coal. Hybrid coal technology\naims to upgrade these lower rank coals and reduce the CO2 emissions. This because the\namount of carbon absorbed by the biomass during its growth is equal to the carbon\nproduced during its combustion hence what is known as a carbon neutral combustion.\nCo-combustion is one of the technological options for coal-biomass blends to produce\nheat. The design and adaptation of the technology used for co-combustion of hybrid coal\nis required and an understanding of the phenomena involved the stages of the thermal\nevents.\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is used to determine the thermal behavior of the\nhybrid coal. This method is widely used in the industry due to it being simple and\nrelatively cheap. Thermogravimetry (TG) and derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) curves\nare the results of thermogravimetric analysis. Both curves represents the weight loss and\nweight loss rates as a function of time and temperature of the hybrid coal. Isoconversional\nmethod (model-free) and model-fitting methods are used to determine the\nkinetic parameters such as, activation energy (Ea) and pre-exponential factor (A). On the\nother hand, the decomposition process of biomass and coal are influenced by its\nmacromolecular structure. The stages of the decomposition are divided into two or three\nsteps depends on the heating rate and the mix used. Biomass used in this sample are\nrubberwood and pinewood. Meanwhile the low rank coal used are lignite and subbituminous.\nThe results based on the model-free approach, samples contain lignite has an\nEa value between 57.25-310.98 kJ/mol, whereas the mixture of sub-bituminous has an Ea\nvalue range of 40.67-226.86 kJ/mol. It is indicated the hybrid coal has suitable for the\ncombustion process.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Evan Vivaldy Andalan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/227795"}, "Penulis": "Evan Vivaldy Andalan [13017113]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
