{"Nomor": 51546, "Judul": "LITERATURE REVIEW OF AN ANTIDIABETIC ACTIVITY OF SEVERAL MEDICINAL PLANTS OF FABACEAE, FROM IN VIVO AND IN VITRO STUDY", "Abstrak": "In the latest research, the diabetes prevalence in 2019 is estimated to be 9.3%, affecting 463 million people, and these worldwide diabetic patients are mounting from 10.2% (578 million) in 2030 to 10.9% (700 million) in 2045. This global disease gives a concern in herbal antidiabetic remedies due to the side effects, high secondary failure rates and the cost of conventional synthetic antidiabetic medications. Consequently, these negative effects of conventional antidiabetic drugs have become an idea to use traditional plants as antidiabetic treatment. The purpose of this research is to explore the potential antidiabetic activity in different plant parts of Abrus precatorius, Clitoria ternatea, Parkia speciosa, and Tamarindus indica extracts and to evaluate the effect of chemical constituents of the plants on antidiabetic activity by reviewing the previous studies. This manuscript is reviewed preclinical data from the selected Fabaceae plant species. The literature survey was done from various sources and the searches were carried out using electronic databases such as Google Scholar and PubMed. The article selection was based on inclusion criteria such as publication in the year 1990-2019, available as free full-text paper and abstracts, written in English, involved the use of extracts from various plant parts, involved an analysis of antidiabetic activity and study method using in vivo and in vitro. All the plant extracts were validated by several studies on their antidiabetic effect on animals (in vivo). All extracts showed potent ?-glucosidase inhibitory activity. In general, the finding is varied according to the type of solvents and parts of the plant used. The antidiabetic properties were related to the presence of flavonoid and flavonol; saponin; terpenoid such as lupenone and taraxerol; alkaloid such as trigonelline; tannin and phlobatannin; and steroids including the subgroup of sterol, sterol lipid such as stigmast-4-ene-3,6-dione, phytosterols such as ?-Sitosterol and stigmasterol in the plant. It was observed that Abrus precatorius, Clitoria ternatea, Parkia speciosa, and Tamarindus indica have a potential to be developed more as antidiabetic from natural products.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Nur Amanina Farhana Abd Wahab": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/215073"}, "Penulis": "Nur Amanina Farhana Abd Wahab [11617765]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Muhamad Insanu, S.Si., M.Si.", "Prof Dr. Irda Fidrianny"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Farmasi Klinik dan Komunitas", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Farmasi", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Fabaceae family, Antidiabetic, Alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, In vivo, In vitro", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Sep 2020"}
