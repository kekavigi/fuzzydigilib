{"Nomor": 57805, "Judul": "FEASIBILITY STUDY OF MULTIPLE LEG COMPLETION IN GEOTHERMAL PROJECT", "Abstrak": "Drilling cost as one major capital investment in geothermal project are significantly needed to attention. Development study to discover new alternative method with enhancing productivity can be solution by implementation in future. Minimizing operation cost with optimizing production is desire commercial viability of the project. Implementation the plan effectively with availability equipment also contribute the successful of the new development.\nThis study discusses multiple leg completion to increase the productivity of wells that are applied to geothermal projects without additional well drilling. The analysis is carried out by comparing the production capabilities of wells with multiple leg completion and conventional vertical wells. By using a homogeneous flow model where the fluid is considered to be in one phase, the pressure changes along the tubing are calculated using the bottom-up method assuming reservoir pressure. The configuration of the multiple leg completion well with two legs is assumed that there is no connection between the reservoir. The model result that productivity is increasing 70-80% than conventional well regarding the accumulation of the mass flow both of legs. Sensitivity parameter also can be consideration to optimize production in multiple-leg completion, like reservoir with higher PI and utilization of optimum casing size. Then, the result can be judges that multiple-leg completion is feasible and need the further development in geothermal project.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yusuf Arif Wibowo [12217059]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dimas Taha Maulana, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Completion, Multiple-leg, Geothermal, Development", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Agu 2021"}
