{"Nomor": 55906, "Judul": "HYDRATE FORMATION PREDICTION OF METHANE IN THE PRESENCE OF CO2 AND H2S", "Abstrak": "Hydrate formation that causes flow assurance problems in natural gas pipelines has been a concern to the operation. Prediction models and equations has been developed to decide whether gas hydrate forms in certain system. In this work, the performance of Ng and Robinson hydrate formation equilibrium prediction is evaluated for binary and ternary mixtures of CH4, CO2, and H2S in water condition. The prediction is done using Aspen HYSYS V10 software. The concentration of H2S is varied between 5-27%-mol while the CO2 is kept at 7%-mol. The pressure and temperature errors are analyzed. The result shows that the simulation shows minimum pressure error of 9.80% and minimum temperature error of 0.27% in ternary mixtures. The appropriate operating condition of the simulation are above 295 K, above 2.70 MPa, and below 15.0%-mol for temperature, pressure, and H2S concentration, respectively in ternary mixtures.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Farrel Adhika Putra": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/227154"}, "Penulis": "Farrel Adhika Putra [13017111]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
