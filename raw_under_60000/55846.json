{"Nomor": 55846, "Judul": "AEROELASTIC ANALYSIS AND PARAMETRIC STUDY OF MULTI BOOM TANDEM WING HALE UAV", "Abstrak": "For the past recent decades, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has undergone rapid development due to its potential to be utilized in various missions. One of the currently developed potential UAV types is the High Altitude Long Endurance Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (HALE UAV) due to its potential utilization in surveillance and communication missions. Despite its high potential, designing a HALE UAV is a perplexing problem as many design aspects contradict one-to-another. Besides, its typical flexible and high aspect ratio wing characteristics also prone to aeroelastic and control nuisances. In general, HALE UAV with a higher degree of freedoms requires more complex aeroelastic analysis as more mode shapes are necessary to be evaluated. One of the new developments concerning HALE design is the triple boom and tandem wing configuration. UAVOS HAPS is a notable example of aircraft which implements this configuration. Due to its configuration and degree of freedom complexities, this HALE UAV configuration requires in-depth aeroelastic analysis. In this study, the aeroelastic aspect of this novel HALE UAV airframe configuration is investigated through coupled finite element and doublet lattice methods. The aircraft model has 12 m span front wing and 15 m span rear wing with operational speed at sea level in 10-14 m/s. The analyses show that the analyzed model has presumably low natural frequencies starting from 0.9 Hz and potentially vulnerable to the aeroelastic divergence phenomenon around 12 m/s. Based on the analyzed data, possible optimizations are then investigated to prevent the aeroelastic phenomenon around its flight envelope. From the parametric study, removing outer booms interaction and stiffening either inner boom or spar increase the divergence speed.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Mileniawan Januar Ramadhani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/227104"}, "Penulis": "Mileniawan Januar Ramadhani [13617019]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
