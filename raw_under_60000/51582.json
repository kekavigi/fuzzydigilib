{"Nomor": 51582, "Judul": "SYNTHESIS, CHARACTERIZATION, AND IN-VITRO EVALUATION OF LIPOPEPTIDE AND OLIGOPEPTIDE- BASED LIPOSOME FOR GENE DELIVERY VEHICLE CANDIDATE", "Abstrak": "Efficient and safe gene delivery into a target cell in gene therapy is one of the active\nareas in pharmaceutical research currently. Non-viral expression vectors are highly\ndesirable due to their safety, stability, and suitability for mass production as bulk\npharmaceuticals. However, low transfection efficiency remains a limiting factor in\nthe application of non-viral gene delivery. Lipopeptide-based gene carriers\ngenerally have low cytotoxicity, are capable of cell membrane penetration, and\nrelatively simple to manufacture. In an attempt to obtain an efficient with low\ncytotoxicity of the non-viral gene delivery vector, we have designed a serial\nshort linear lipopeptide transfection agents (MW of 700-1300 Da), consisting of an\nalkyl chain of lauryl (C-12) or palmitoyl (C-16), one cysteine, 1 to 5 histidine and\n1 to 3 lysine residues. The lipopeptides were designed to facilitate dimerization via\ncysteine residue, the DNA binding at a neutral pH (making use of charged lysine\nresidues), and endosomal escape (by way of weakly basic histidine residues via\nproton sponge-like mechanism). Molecular interaction and dynamic simulation were\nperformed to study the possibility of the short lipopeptide in facilitating active nuclear\nactive by interacting with a shuttle protein of Importin-?. In-vitro evaluation of the\ntransfection agent/DNA complexes was performed for their biophysical properties\nand transfection efficiencies. The in-silico interaction showed that Lau-CK2H and\nPal-CK2H2 hypothetically expedited nuclear uptake. Both lipopeptides had lower\nbinding energy (-6.3 kcal/mol and -6.2 kcal/mol, respectively), compared to the\nnative ligand, viz, NLS (-5.4 kcal/mol). The number and identity of amino acids\nincorporated in the short linear lipopeptide construct affected their lipopeptide/\nDNA complex-forming capacity, protection from DNase degradation, and\ntransfection efficiency. In-vitro transfection studies in COS-7 cells revealed that the\nefficiency of gene delivery of the luciferase encoding plasmid, pCMV-Luc,\nmediated by all the short linear lipopeptides, was much higher than Poly(L-lysine),\nwhich has no endosomal escape system. The transgene expression (ng\nLuciferase/mg protein) facilitated by two lipopeptides (Pal-CK2H2 and Pal-\nCK3H2) was slightly higher than that of branched polyethylene-imine (PEI-25K).\nThe transgene expression of short linear lipopeptide was also enhanced by\nchloroquine up to 8-fold; however, it dramatically reduced in the presence of an\ninhibitor vacuolar H (+)-ATPase of bafilomycin A1 and restored to the initial value\nwhen the chloroquine was added into transfection systems. Co-polymer PEI-25K\nenhanced the transgene expression of the short linear lipopeptide-mediated gene\ndelivery up to 50-fold, probably by interfering complex particle sizes and involving\nin the intracellular trafficking. More extended lipopeptide of Pal-CK2H2 carrying\npeptide sequences of trans-activator of transcription (TAT: YGRKKRRQRRR) and\nnuclear localization sequence (NLS: PKKKRKV) have been constructed to increase\nthe capability of the lipopeptide in condensing DNA and penetrating the cell\nmembranes. The extended lipopeptide (MW 3.3 kDa) and oligopeptide of TAT-NLS\n(MW 3.0 kDa) were synthesized using a peptide synthesizer according to the Fmocbased solid-phase peptide synthesis method. The extended lipopeptide could bind,\ncondense, and protect DNA from DNase degradation efficiently. The lipopeptide\ncomposed of TAT-NLS/DNA nanoparticles were stable for up to 20 days at 6-8\no\nC.\nIntriguingly, TEM images of the lipopeptide/DNA complexes at charge ratio 4.0\nwere homogenous with a compact size of ~120 nm. The lipopeptides were also\nconsidered less cytotoxic to CHO-K1 and HepG2 cells then Poly-L-Lysine and\nLipofectamine\nTM\n-2000. Transfection study using GFP encoding gene (pCSII-EF-\nAcGFP) revealed that the protein expression mediated by the lipopeptide was\nobserved at charge ratio 4.0-8.0. The oligopeptide of TAT-NLS based-liposome\nwith a neutral DOPE has increased the GFP expression on HepG2 cells comparable\nor slightly higher than the most common commercially available Lipofectamine\nTM\n-\n2000. These results indicated that the lipopeptide-based transfection agent and the\noligopeptide-based liposome could condense and protect DNA efficiently, forms\nstable and homogenous nanoparticles, and displays favourable characteristics as the\npotential gene carrier candidate with low cytotoxicity. The peptide-based\ntransfection agents need to be optimized further, including the option of the type of\nalkyl chains (saturated or non-saturated alkyl chains), the sequence of the amino\nacid residues (linear or branched) included in the transfection agents. The\nformulation of a liposome-derived transfection agent needs to be optimized by\nselecting a different kind of lipids and surfactants for efficient in-vitro and in-vivo\ngene delivery purposes.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Tarwadi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/215143", "COVER Tarwadi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/244125", "BAB 1 Tarwadi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/244126", "BAB 2 Tarwadi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/244127", "BAB 3 Tarwadi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/244128", "BAB 4 Tarwadi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/244129", "BAB 5 Tarwadi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/244130", "BAB 6 Tarwadi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/244131", "PUSTAKA Tarwadi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/244132"}, "Penulis": "Tarwadi [30716301]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Sukmadjaja Asyarie", "Prof. Dr. Heni Rachmawati, Apt., M.Si.", "Dr.rer.nat.
