{"Nomor": 53851, "Judul": "STATIC STRENGTH ANALYSIS OF TRAIN CAPSULE\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdS UPPER FRAME WITH FINITE ELEMENT METHOD USING SHELL ELEMENT", "Abstrak": "Vehicles such as motorcycles and cars are increasing every year. In the year of 2000, the number of motorcycles are just only 13,564,017. This number increases 6 times to 84,732,652 on 2013. The increase in the number of vehicles are not proportional with the growth of infrastructure, such as roads and highways. This can cause a congestion in urban area. In Indonesia, the construction of subway and trem are impossible because the housing in rural area are crowded. Therefore, a suitable public transport for this case is to bulid a train capsule which runs in elevated path.\nTrain Capsule is one of the national trains owned by PT. Teknik Rekayasa Kereta Kapsul. In order for this train to operate in Indonesia, there are some requirements needed such as a certification by the government of Indonesia. The requirements are static load test for the upper structure of the Train Capsule. This project is focus on determining the safety level of the upper frame of the train capsule structure based on Regulation of the Minister of Transportation No. 175 of 2015 and Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS) E7105, finding the stress that occurs on each testing method, and modeling the test loading method in the real experiment.\nThis final project uses finite element method with shell element using a software called ANSYS 16.0 to perform the stress analysis that occurs on each testing method and this analysis discusses the loading test method which using a tank of water.\nThe results of this analysis show that the maximum equivalent stress on the body frame is 54 MPa, 122 MPa on the base frame, and 92.655 MPa on the basket for vertical load test.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Stanley Corneliaz H.S.": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/221595"}, "Penulis": "Stanley Corneliaz H.S.
