BY USING ZEBRAFISH MODEL (DANIO RERIO) AND ANTI-ANGIOGENESIS LITERATURE REVIEW OF MEDICINAL PLANTS", "Abstrak": "Angiogenesis is the generation of new blood vessels from an existing vasculature. Angiogenesis\ncontributes to the pathogenesis of several diseases such those as chronic inflammatory diseases,\ndiabetic retinopathy, and tumor growth. Research on anti-angiogenesis activity just begun arising\nin its popularity and are still very limited, thus one of the aims of this study is to present literature\nreview of anti-angiogenic activity of several medicinal plants. Acute toxicity test towards zebrafish\nembryos is also conducted to evaluate the toxic effect and determine LC50 value. Acute toxicity test\nis conducted referring to the guideline of Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development\n(OECD) protocol no. 236 year 2013, which includes a normal group (DMSO 0,01%), positive control\ngroup (3,4-dichloroaniline 4 \u00b5g/ml), and extract test group. Zebrafish embryos are exposed to\nethanolic extract of bajakah and Piper nigrum L. starting from age 6hpf. The effects of the exposure\ncaused malformations towards the zebrafish embryos such that as yolk sac edema, pericardial\nedema, eye, tail, somite and back bone deformations. The obtained LC50 for bajakah is 226.3 \u00b5g/ml,\nshowing slight toxicity, and Piper nigrum L. is 30.1 \u00b5g/ml, showing moderate toxicity.
