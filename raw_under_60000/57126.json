{"Nomor": 57126, "Judul": "NUMERICAL SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENT OF TRANSVERSE CRACK ON COMPOSITE STRUCTURE USING EXTENDED FINITE ELEMENT METHOD (XFEM)", "Abstrak": "The success of composite materials applications in aerospace industries and other areas has inspired continuous intensive research including the exploration of natural based composites such as bamboos. As part of the process to understand the damage mechanism of bamboo as natural unidirectional composites, transverse crack of bamboo in semi-circular arc bend (SCAB) specimens were examined in this study through experiments and numerical studies. The experiments were conducted through three-point bending test, while the numerical studies were performed using eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) to simulate the crack propagation. The result from the experiments and simulations were processed to determine the load-displacement relation, the crack propagation of the structure and fracture toughness. The XFEM simulation showed the value of peak load before crack extension closed to experimental results. The numerical studies also can simulate the three cracks relations between numerical and experiments can be attributed to the over-stiffness of the FEM element. The experiment give fracture toughness value of 2.27 ????????????????? at 90% reliability.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Devano Yehezkiel Adipradhana": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/229732"}, "Penulis": "Devano Yehezkiel Adipradhana [13617121]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
