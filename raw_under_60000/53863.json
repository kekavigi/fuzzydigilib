{"Nomor": 53863, "Judul": "VISUAL-BASED FLUID MOTION ESTIMATOR WITH DEEP LEARNING", "Abstrak": "Biomimicry has been one the most interesting scientific topics that might lead\nto groundbreaking technologies, and particle image velocimetry (PIV) is one\nof the instruments to observe it. Hence, developing a state-of-the-art motion\nestimator program to perform PIV should be a promising option to support it.\nUp until now, the cross-correlation with window deformation iterative method\n(WIDIM) is the go-to method to perform PIV image processing because of its\nfast computation and decent accuracy. Another option for it is using the optical\nflow method or the variation of it. The optical flow can estimate a detailed\nvelocity field even for complex flow cases, but it took too long to process. As\nan emerging technology, using a deep learning approach for motion estimation\nshould be an interesting option. It is later proven that a PIV image processing\nprogram with the LiteFlowNet deep learning model can provide a robust\nsolution for either simple or more complex flow pattern. It also provides a\nmuch faster computing time, that would be helpful for handling experiments\nwith numerous images. A PIV experimental setup to measure and investigate\nthe flow around a flapping wing will be discussed also to provide a real test to\nthe motion estimator program. Finally, it is later shown that the developed\nmotion estimator program is able to diagnose the flow behaviour of a root\ncanal irrigation with eddy tip activation without the help of a PIV experimental\nsetup. Thus, providing a novel approach in the root canal irrigation\nquantitative analysis through visual images.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Faber Yosua Octavianus": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/221610"}, "Penulis": "Faber Yosua Octavianus [23618013]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Lavi Rizki Zuhal"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Mesin", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "motion estimator, flow measurement, particle image velocimetry, optical flow, deep learning, liteflownet, root canal irrigation, eddy tip activation", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Mar 2021"}
