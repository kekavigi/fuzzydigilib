{"Nomor": 53312, "Judul": "MODULATED EXCITATION IMAGING SYSTEM FOR INTRAVASCULAR ULTRASOUND", "Abstrak": "Advances in methodologies and tools often\nlead to new insights into cardiovascular diseases.\nIntravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is a well-established diagnostic\nmethod that provides high-resolution images of the\nvessel wall and atherosclerotic plaques. High-frequency\n(>50 MHz) ultrasound enables the spatial resolution of IVUS\nto approach that of optical imaging methods. However, the\npenetration depth decreases when using higher imaging\nfrequencies due to the greater acoustic attenuation. An\nimaging method that improves the penetration depth of\nhigh-resolution IVUS would, therefore, be of major clinical\nimportance. Modulated excitation imaging is known to\nallow ultrasound waves to penetrate further. This paper\npresents an ultrasound system specifically for modulatedexcitation-\nbased IVUS imaging. The system incorporates a\nhigh-voltage waveform generator and an image processing\nboard that are optimized for IVUS applications. In addition,\na miniaturized ultrasound transducer has been constructed\nusing a Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3\u2013PbTiO3 single crystal to improve\nthe ultrasound characteristics. The results show\nthat the proposed system was able to provide increases\nof 86.7% in penetration depth and 9.6 dB in the signal-tonoise\nratio for 60 MHz IVUS. In vitro tissue samples were\nalso investigated to demonstrate the performance of the\nsystem.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Weibao Qiu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xingying Wang, Yan Chen, Qiang Fu, Min Su, Lining Zhang, Jingjing Xia, Jiyan Dai, Yaonan Zhang, and Hairong Zheng"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "High-frequency ultrasound, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), modulated excitation, ultrasound imaging, ultrasound system.", "Sumber": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "03 Mar 2021"}
