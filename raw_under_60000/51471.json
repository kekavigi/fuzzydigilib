{"Nomor": 51471, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT OF A MULTI AIRPORT TRAFFIC SIMULATION PLATFORM FOR AIR SIDE DELAY ANALYSIS", "Abstrak": "This undergraduate thesis discusses the development of a simulation framework that can be used to perform the analysis of delay and capacity of an airport. The framework is based on a randomly generated schedule of two or more interconnected airports. The simulation only considers the air side areas of an airport. The delays included in the simulation or analysis are those that occur due to conflict in runway usage.\nIn this undergraduate thesis, the author first focuses in randomly generating the schedule of two or more interconnected airports. This is done by inputting a number of aircrafts in each airport where the destination and aircraft types are randomized.\nThe second focus is to check whether the schedule generated has met the conditions of the runway usage imposed in this undergraduate thesis. If the schedule generated has not fulfilled the conditions, then the next focus is how the schedule can be shifted to fulfill all the conditions based on which condition is not fulfilled.\nThe final focus of this undergraduate thesis is to calculate parameters that can be used to analyze the delay and capacity of an airport. This is mainly done by comparing the initial schedule randomly generated with the schedule that has been checked and shifted.\nThis thesis\u2019 work shows how the framework is created based on the three main focuses and how the results of the framework can be used to analyze delay and capacity of an airport.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Bima Mahayana Rachman": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214926"}, "Penulis": "Bima Mahayana Rachman [13616102]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ony Arifianto, Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Multi Airport Model, Interconnections, Monte Carlo Simulation, Statistical Data, Random Generation", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Sep 2020"}
