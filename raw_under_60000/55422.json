{"Nomor": 55422, "Judul": "ANALYSIS OF SOIL PROPERTIES, BACTERIAL COMMUNITY  COMPOSITION, AND FUNCTIONAL PROFILING OF HIGH-YIELD  AND LOW-YIELD OIL PALM (ELAEIS GUINEENSIS JACQ.) PLANTATIONS", "Abstrak": "Palm oil is a rapidly growing mass-produced good, extracted from the mesocarp and kernel of \nthe oil palm plant (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.). Sustainable land intensification is key to keeping \nup with this growing demand, minimising environmental impact. This can be done by \noptimising the plant\u2019s yield. Yield can be affected by the quality of the edaphic properties, the\nmicrobial community that inhabits the soil, and the interactions between the two. Functional \nprediction of the soil microbiome has also become a key tool in studying microbial \ncommunities. The purpose of this research is to define the differences in microbial composition, \nfunctional characteristics, and edaphic properties between oil palm plantations of low-yield and \nhigh-yield in Indonesia\u2019s primary producers: Kalimantan, Sumatra, and Sulawesi. This \nresearch will also define the correlation between microbial composition and edaphic properties. \n9 samples of secondary soil bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon data and edaphic data were \nextracted from these locations\u2019 oil palm plantation soils, dividing them into groups based on \nyield and region: high_Kalimantan, high_Sulawesi, low_Kalimantan, and low_Sumatra. 7 out \nof 9 samples passed quality control by QIIME2-DADA2. Metagenomic and functional \nprofiling of these groups were generated using QIIME2, GenePiper, and QIIME2-PICRUSt2. \nPrinciple component analysis (PCA) by XLSTAT and Pearson\u2019s Correlation Matrix by R was \nperformed on edaphic and microbial data. No significant differences in bacterial alpha and beta \ndiversity were found between groups. The high_Sulawesi group showed a significantly higher \nrelative abundance of the beneficial genera Kutzneria, Bradyrhizobium and Actinoallomurus. \nHigh-yield groups showed a significantly higher relative abundance of the beneficial genus \nNocardioides. The predicted dipeptide permease ATP-binding cassette (Dpp ABC) transporter \nsystem was more prevalent in Kalimantan groups. Based on PCA, the order from highest to \nlowest in value for beneficial edaphic properties was high_Sulawesi, low_Sumatra, \nhigh_Kalimantan, and then low_Kalimantan. The opposite was found for potentially negative \nedaphic properties. Based on the correlation matrix, the relative abundance of Acidicaldus was \nsignificantly negatively correlated with silt content and cation exchange capacity (CEC). The \nrelative abundance of Bradyrhizobium, Kutzneria, and Actinoallomurus significantly positively \ncorrelated with potential K2O. The relative abundance of Nocardioides was significantly \nnegatively correlated with organic carbon content (OC). It is concluded that groupings based \non yield for edaphic properties were not found. Instead, both Kalimantan groups were relatively \nlower in beneficial edaphic properties and relatively higher in potentially negative edaphic \nproperties, compared to the other groups. High-yield groups had a significantly higher relative \nabundance of the beneficial genus Nocardioides than low-yield groups. The High_Sulawesi group also had a significantly higher relative abundance of the beneficial genera Kutzneria, \nBradyrhizobium, and Actinoallomurus than all other groups. No functional characteristics were \nfound defining plantations based on yield, though the Kalimantan groups are higher in the \nrelative abundance of the Dpp ABC transporter system. The relative abundance of Acidicaldus\nwas significantly negatively correlated with silt content and CEC. The relative abundance of \nall beneficial genera apart from Nocardioides significantly positively correlated with potential \nK2O, while the relative abundance of Nocardioides was significantly negatively correlated with \nOC.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Safira Alethia Loebis": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/226013"}, "Penulis": "Safira Alethia Loebis [10617005]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Adi Pancoro", "Karlia Meitha, S.Si., M.Si., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Biologi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Ilmu dan Teknologi Hayati", "Subjek": "Life sciences ; biology", "Kata Kunci": "metagenomic 16sRNA profiling, oil-palm yield, soil microbiome, functional profiling", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti \u00a0\n                                     Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Jun 2021"}
