{"Nomor": 56436, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENTAL DESIGN OF SIT-TO-STAND EXOSKELETON FOR PARAPLEGIC PATIENTS", "Abstrak": "Paraplegia is a disability that affecting an increasing number of people every year in\nIndonesia. Unfortunately, the development of technology to aid people with this disability\nhas yet to be improved to meet the needs of the local population. Rehabilitation devices\navailable in local hospitals only have basic functions, while commercially available\nalternatives are too expensive for the income of most Indonesians. To solve this issue, the\nBiomechanics Research Team of FMAE ITB has previously developed two prototypes of a\nrehabilitative device that assists in sit-to-stand movement for paraplegic patients.\nUnfortunately, both iterations have limitations and have yet to be evaluated with a paraplegic\nsubject. This thesis to a developmental design of the exoskeleton that can overcome the\nprevious shortcomings and be operated with a paraplegic subject is created.\nThe developmental design process in this thesis includes three main phases. First is\nthe conceptual design phase which includes the gathering of information and evaluation of\nexisting devices to set the guidelines of the design. It is followed by the embodiment design\nphase which focuses on the realization of the design of the exoskeleton using CAD and\nengineering simulation software. Finally, there is the detailed design phase which is the\ndocumentation of all necessary aspects of the design of the exoskeleton.\nThe output of this thesis is a complete design and documentation for the production\nof an active lower-body sit-to-stand exoskeleton that can accommodate the anthropometry\nof the average Indonesia, while also limiting the cost to make it affordable for the income of\nthe majority of the population.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Muhammad Rafi Atqan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/228112"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Rafi Atqan [13116233]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
