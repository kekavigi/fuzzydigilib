{"Nomor": 56252, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT OF RISK ESTIMATION MODEL FOR COVID-19 TRANSMISSION ON PASSENGER HANDLING PROCESS IN AIRPORT TERMINAL", "Abstrak": "The number of people infected by the COVID-19 in the world continues to increase significantly until now. Transportation places are one of the places where the virus is transmitted most. As its characteristics, air transport has the greatest contributor amongst all transportation modes. This study combines two models from previous researches that can be used to estimate the virus transmission risk in passenger handling process in the airport terminal. The model was developed based on the Wells\u2013Riley equation, and then the effects of wearing mask, passenger distancing (or density in a lounge), exposure time and types of pre-flight COVID-19 testing on the risk of transmission of COVID-19 are considered. It showed that the risk of virus transmission is influenced by the wearing of masks, the types of pre-flight COVID-19 test, physical distancing (or room density), exposure time, and air circulation (ventilation) type in the lounge. It is hoped that this paper can be used to manage the COVID-19 transmission risk as low as can be accepted.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Reyhan Fadyla Rohmana": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/227747"}, "Penulis": "Reyhan Fadyla Rohmana [13617122]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
