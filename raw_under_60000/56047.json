Stimulation treatment is known can improve the production by removing the formation damage. Matrix acidizing is the most known and proven effective for stimulation treatment. Over the years, many studies have been conducted and the result is that there are three matrix acidizing model for sandstone commonly used in the field which is Dowell model (1940), McLeod model (1984), and Kalfayan model (2008).\nMatrix acidizing in this study is conducted in geothermal sandstone formation well with quartz and silica dominated. Then, the well has a low permeability. There are five acid fluid model will be injected to compare and evaluate the result of skin factor and productivity index during acidizing. Five types of acid will be used are 12% HCl - 3% HF (Dowell model), 6% HCl \u2013 1.5% HF (McLeod model), 10% HCl \u2013 5% HF (Kalfayan model), 5% HF main acid, and the last was using 9% HF main acid.\nIn this study, well performance calculation and analysis are used to determine whether this well is a good candidate for acidizing. Input parameter such as the wellbore performance is calculated and should be maintained below the fracture pressure. This study presents the sensitivity of acid fluid model, volume and concentration injected to determine the optimum result of matrix acidizing design in this well. The result consists of skin factor value after acidizing and ratio of productivity index dimensionless before acidizing and after acidizing (FOI).", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Muhammad Prasetya Dwi Aurianto": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/227489"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Prasetya Dwi Aurianto [12216101]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dimas Taha Maulana, S.T., M.T.", "Steven Chandra, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Geothermal well, matrix acidizing design, acid fluid model, volume, and concentration injected", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Jun 2021"}
