{"Nomor": 56687, "Judul": "LITERATURE REVIEW ON MEDICINAL PROPERTIES AND PHYTOCHEMICAL STUDIES OF  CARICA PAPAYA", "Abstrak": "Carica papaya Linn is commonly called betik in Malaysia, and it belongs to the family of Caricaceae. \nThe different parts of papaya possess excellent medicinal properties for the treatment of various \nailments. Papaya is known for numerous pharmacological activities due to phenolics, flavonoids and \nalkaloids as the essential phytochemicals. Further, many commercial products obtained from different \nplant parts are available and utilized for various purposes. This review mainly focuses on the various \nphytochemicals present in other parts of C. papaya, their pharmacological activities and also the \napplications of the commercial and clinical drug products derived from those parts of Carica papaya \nplant. The feasibility criteria for this study are different parts of C. papaya, the phytochemical content \nand their pharmacological activities. For writing this review paper, online scientific databases were \nused, for instance, PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, Science Direct and ResearchGate. The sources \nwas limited to research journals published in the last ten years, from January 2010 to April 2021 to \ndetect valid reports, studies and investigations. As the outcomes, Carica papaya produces latex rich \nin papain (a major proteolytic enzyme), phenolics, flavonoids, and alkaloids as the major \nphytochemicals responsible for the various pharmacological activities such as anti-dengue, \nantibacterial, antifertility agent and antioxidant. The literature study concluded that C. papaya can be \ndeveloped as an alternative medicine for different disease prevention and therapeutic targets.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Fatin Farhana binti A.
