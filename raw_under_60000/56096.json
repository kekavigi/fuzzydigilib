Hydraulic Fracturing operation has been a key to stimulates the performance of the well with a low\npermeability characteristics. But, in the other hand, it inject a lot of fracturing fluid, especially water and it\npotentially making several reservoir problem. Surfactant injection is operated in hope for minimize that problem.\nThe surfactant injection are do with Huff n\u2019 Puff Methods and based on one well. This one well is operates as the\nproducer and the injector. At first, the simulation are held with no injection at all but with the hydraulic fracturing\noperation. Next, the injection well, which is the producer well it self, will controlled as a Huff n\u2019 Puff well with\nsurfactant injection. Then, the results are in and the production characteristics are being analyzed\nWith this methods, the production of the well are increased and it showed from the oil production in the well after\nthe huff n puff operation. Next, the saturation of oil are also being analyzed with the grid around the perforation\nof the well. Also, the pressure showing a slower decreased than without surfactant injection. The flowback effect\nof the hydraulic fracturing are also showed positive results.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK M.Raharsya Andiva Pratama": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/227571"}, "Penulis": "M.Raharsya Andiva Pratama [12217057]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
