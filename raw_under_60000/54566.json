{"Nomor": 54566, "Judul": "PROPOSED CORRECTION FOR OIL MATERIAL BALANCE ANALYSIS", "Abstrak": "The determination of original oil in place (OOIP) is one of the main concerns in reservoir study, as it is the first step to analyze the feasibility of project development, technically and economically. Two methods that have been used for years are volumetric and material balance method. The volumetric method uses static data from geological model that is built before the reservoir is produced. Material balance method uses dynamic data, which is production and pressure data. Thus, this method can only be used after the reservoir has been produced for a period of time. Ideally, both methods will give the same result of OOIP, but a previous study shows that there is at least a 16% difference between those methods, with a larger value from material balance method calculation.\nThe objective of this study is to investigate this difference and try to give a simple solution. Sensitivity analysis in this study shows that the change in rock and fluid properties such as oil specific gravity, porosity, and permeability, affects the value of the difference itself. The difference, stated as the error, is then correlated as a function of oil specific gravity, porosity, and permeability. This correlation can be used to calculate a more accurate OOIP using material balance method.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Dixiezetha A F Thamrin": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/223567"}, "Penulis": "Dixiezetha A F Thamrin [12208056]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
