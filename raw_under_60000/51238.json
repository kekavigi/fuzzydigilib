{"Nomor": 51238, "Judul": "IMPLICATION OF SHORELINE CHANGE ON SPATIAL PLANNING - A CASE STUDY IN SEMARANG MUNICIPALITY AND DEMAK REGENCY COASTAL AREA, INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "A shoreline recession that occurred in both Semarang Municipality and Demak\nRegency, two adjacent administrative areas, causes in physical, economic, and\nsocial influences, such as the loss of many fish ponds, rice fields, and the damage\nto settlements, buildings, and infrastructures.\nThis study set three objectives to have sustainable land use planning on both study\nareas. 1) Analyze the shoreline change and the coastal land use conversion in the\nstudy area. 2) Analyze the suitability of the actual coastal land use and the current\nregional spatial planning documents. 3) Propose a strategic direction toward the\nsuitable coastal spatial planning policy.\nThis study used both quantitative and qualitative approaches. In the quantitative\napproach, the shoreline change and the coastal land use conversion were analyzed\nby using remote sensing satellite imagery data. This approach also analyzed the\nsuitability of the actual coastal land use based on the current regional spatial\nplanning documents. In the qualitative approach, SWOT analysis was employed to\nformulate the strategic direction of the coastal spatial planning policy.\nThis study cleared that the shoreline recession has implicated the coastal land use\nchange on Semarang Municipality and Demak Regency. Their actual land use are\ninconsistent with the current spatial planning documents that have been formulated\nbefore. Based on these discussions, this study proposed a strategic direction for\nsuitable coastal spatial planning", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Karunia Akbar": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214458", "BAB 1 Karunia Akbar": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214459", "BAB 2 Karunia Akbar": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214460", "BAB 3 Karunia Akbar": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214461", "BAB 4 Karunia Akbar": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214462", "BAB 5 Karunia Akbar": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214463", "BAB 6 Karunia Akbar": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214464", "DAFTAR Karunia Akbar": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214465", "2020 TS PP KARUNIA AKBAR_LAMPIRAN.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214466", "2020 TS PP KARUNIA AKBAR_JURNAL.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214467"}, "Penulis": "Karunia Akbar [25418010]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Saut Aritua Hasiholan Sagala, S.T., M.Sc."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Perencanaan Wilayah dan Kota", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Arsitektur, Perencanaan dan Pengembangan Kebijakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "shoreline change, land use change, remote sensing, spatial planning, strategic direction", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yoninur Almira", "File": "10 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2020"}
