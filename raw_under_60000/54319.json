{"Nomor": 54319, "Judul": "UTILIZING THERMOELECTRIC GENERATOR FOR RECOVERING WASTE HEAT FROM ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE PLASMA JET", "Abstrak": "Energy has been amongst the most essential resources that endorses the progress,\nevolution, and prosperity of human societies. There are various ways to supply energy for\nhuman population and one of them is using thermoelectric generator (TEG). TEG is a\ndevice that generates electricity by means of Seebeck effect. TEG converts temperature\ndifference along the device into electricity. In this research, two TEG chips were used as\nparts of a waste heat recovery system of an atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ). The\nAPPJ is used for coating process on a glass. Prediction of the open-circuit voltage and\nthermal analysis of this TEG-based waste heat recovery system was the objectives of this\nresearch.\nThe heat transfer of this process was simulated as a tool to crosscheck the\nexperiment of recovering heat from the APPJ process using TEG. The TEG was modelled\nas a three-layer cuboid consisting of one thermoelectric-leg layer and two ceramics layers.\nThe air gap between TEG chips and other components were modelled as a contact thermal\nresistance (CTRs). The airflow was excluded in calculation domain, but the convection\nwas considered in boundary condition of the calculation. To calibrate the CTRs, a heat gun\nwas used as a static heat source.\nUsing the calibrated parameters, TEG-APPJ waste heat recovery was simulated\nusing a finite element analysis software. The heat input was modelled using Gaussian heat\ndistribution. The simulation temperature and open-circuit voltage provided good agreement\nwith the experiment data. There was overshoot in the open-circuit voltage after reaching its\nmaximum value, 8 V. The temperature distribution was learned to be highly affected by\nwidest air gap between the TEG and vacuum plate.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Ahmad Abror": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/222502", "COVER Ahmad Abror": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/260445", "PUSTAKA Ahmad Abror": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/260452"}, "Penulis": "Ahmad Abror [13116109]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
