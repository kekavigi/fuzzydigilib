{"Nomor": 51237, "Judul": "IDENTIFICATION OF FACTORS AFFECTING THE PERFORMANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY OF WASTE BANKS IN URBAN AREAS: CASE STUDY OF EAST JAKARTA AND BEKASI MUNICIPALITY, INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "Urban waste management becomes one of the most complex and cost-intensive\npublic service, i.e., it takes a large part of municipal budgets. In the Indonesian\ncontext, Law No. 18 of 2008 related to waste management explains the new\nparadigm of waste management based on society participation using the concept\nof reduce, reuse, recycle (3Rs). Furthermore, the Indonesian Ministry of\nEnvironment Regulation No. 13/2012 instituted guidelines for the\nimplementation of 3Rs through a waste bank identify waste banks as necessary\nfor transformation to an Integrated sustainable waste management (ISWM). The\naim of this research to achieve sustainability and improvement of waste bank\nperformance by finding and clarifying the factors that affecting the performance\nof waste bank; analyzing which factor that most affecting the performance of\nwaste bank in urban area; and evaluating the performance of waste bank.\nThis report presents discussion of options to improve waste banks based on a\nliterature review and regulation undertaken at the national level. The main\nmethod of this research is Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). It is a method\nfor structuring the complexity of the problem in a hierarchy and assessing the\nrelative importance of each variable/criterion and establishing the\nvariable/criterion with the highest priority. Moreover, it is possible to solve the\nproblem which is lack of complete written data or quantitative data. First, we\nsynthesized the factors, indicators, and parameters affecting waste bank\nmanagement performance based on the opinions of experts in the literature\nreview and previous research. Secondly, we calculated weighting coefficients\nusing Analysis Hierarchy Process (AHP) method for each factor and indicator.\nLastly, 20 waste banks in East Jakarta and Bekasi municipalities were evaluated\nby multiplying the indicator and factor scores by the corresponding weighting\ncoefficients. The scores are obtained from averaging the score of parameters in\neach indicator by heads of waste bank. Then the results of the ranking of the\nKoleksi digital milik UPT PerpustakaanITB :Hanya di pergunakan di area kampus ITB untukkeperluanpendidikandanpenelitianiv\niviviv\nwaste bank performance are obtained.\nThe analysis result gives information that environmental factor is the most\ncrucial factor which affect the performance and sustainability of waste bank.\nMoreover, the weighting coefficients of indicators for environmental factors\nwere more or less equal, with the highest coefficient of urban carrying capacity\nwhose parameters include population growth, level of human activity, and level\nof land use. Meanwhile, in the performance of waste bank, it shows that\ngovernment-based waste bank has the best performance (Waste Bank Central of\nKramat Jati) and the worst performance was Waste Bank Bambu Asri\n(community-based).", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Ruth Isabella Simamora": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214449", "BAB 1 Ruth Isabella Simamora": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214450", "BAB 2 Ruth Isabella Simamora": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214451", "BAB 3 Ruth Isabella Simamora": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214452", "BAB 4 Ruth Isabella Simamora": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214453", "BAB 5 Ruth Isabella Simamora": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214454", "BAB 6 Ruth Isabella Simamora": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214455", "DAFTAR Ruth Isabella Simamora": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214456", "2020 TS PP RUTH ISABELLA SIMAMORA_LAMPIRAN.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214457"}, "Penulis": "Ruth Isabella Simamora [25418041]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Sri Maryati, S.T., MIP."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Perencanaan Wilayah dan Kota", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Arsitektur, Perencanaan dan Pengembangan Kebijakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), interview, questionnaire, waste bank, performance, sustainability", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yoninur Almira", "File": "9 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2020"}
