{"Nomor": 51991, "Judul": "EXAMINING PERFORMANCE OF ADDITIVES USED FOR CO2 INJECTION AT LOW AND HIGH RESERVOIR TEMPERATURE IN \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdL\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd FIELD", "Abstrak": "During the last decades, CO2 injection has been used extensively for Enhanced Oil Recovery because it has high displacement efficiency. The obstacle met while achieving miscible CO2 injection is a high value of Minimum Miscibility Pressure (MMP) as a miscibility parameter. \u201cL\u201d field is a mature field in Indonesia and has more than 90% C7+ of the oil composition. CO2 injection is planned to be done in \u201cL\u201d field. MMP must be reached to create a miscible injection. Due to low reservoir pressure and high reservoir temperature, MMP should be lowered. Using an appropriate additive could lower MMP and obtain higher oil recovery. The purpose of this study is to examine the performance of additives used for CO2 injection in low and high reservoir temperature in \u201cL\u201d Field. Current temperature condition of the reservoir is considered as \u201clow temperature\u201d in the amount of 136 F and the \u201chigh temperature\u201d is 278.5 F. The study begins with a discussion of MMP determination with cell-to-cell method by using commercial phase behavior and fluid property program, CMG Winprop. The additives used consists of some functional groups of organic compounds. The analysis is separated into two categories of functional group. Alcohol and Ketone perform better at high temperature for all amount of mole simulated. Performance of Amine, Ether, and Aldehyde not only depend on temperature condition but also amount of mole mixing in the injection. Analysis of the additives performance could give a suggestion for further CO2 injection project at the current temperature, or higher temperature in another reservoir in \u201cL\u201d field.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Virgiria Jeannette Edelrose [12214066]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
