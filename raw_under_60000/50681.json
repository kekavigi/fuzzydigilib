{"Nomor": 50681, "Judul": "COMPLETION DESIGN FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MULTI-LAYER & MULTI-FLUID RESERVOIR SYSTEM IN OFFSHORE WELL X", "Abstrak": "Completion systems are important components in hydrocarbon field development. As the link between the reservoir and surface facilities, completions need to be designed for maximizing hydrocarbon recovery and able to withstand consistently changing conditions for years within the safety requirements. Designing completion for well that consist of multi-layer and multi-fluid reservoir can be challenging. The completion design must use the right materials and able to safely produce whether single, commingle, or adding any artificial lifts depends on which method has the most optimum value. This paper discusses the model development of completion design for an offshore well X, one of offshore wells with multi-layer and multi-fluid reservoir system in Indonesia. Well X penetrates two productive layers: upper layer X-1 and lower layer X-2. The upper layer is a gas reservoir with initial gas in place of 1440 MMSCF and the lower layer is an oil reservoir with initial oil in place of 6.1 MMSTB. The model design used available field data such as PVT and DST from well X. The base well completion is also used to model the completion design in software. The commercial software is utilized to estimate the well hydrocarbon recovery. Various designs are tested until a design is selected that maximize production and hydrocarbon recovery. The completion design selected is 9? inch 47 ppf L-80 production casing, 7? inch 29.7 ppf L-80 liner, and produced commingle with oil and gas recovery around 50.16% and 92.3% in 5 years production.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Vincent Chandra": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/213317"}, "Penulis": "Vincent Chandra [12216078]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wijoyo Niti Daton, S.T., M.T.", "Steven Chandra, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "completion, multi-layer, multi-fluid, hydrocarbon, production", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Sep 2020"}
