The understanding of parameters influencing like well spacing is a vital for the economic development of unconventional reservoirs.Nowadays technology is continuing to improve and able to produce energy from places that weren\u2019t previously possible. This alternative energy called unconventional energy. Shale Gas has been developed well in US. It shows that shale gas is important energy resource of unconventional energy besides conventional energy such as oil and gas. There are two laws that applied in Shale Gas which are Darcy\u2019s law and Fick\u2019s law. As we all know we use only darcy\u2019s law in conventional reservoir. In Shale Gas we use darcy\u2019s law for the gas flow through the fracture. While fick\u2019s law applicable to the flow from matrix rocks towards fracture. Therefore in shale gas reservoir, there is sorbed gas beside free gas (darcy\u2019s law). The calculation of Intial Gas In Place is divided into two which is the free gas and sorbed gas. Performed validation the value of calculations using well production data for Initial Gas In Place\nThis thesis highlights production modeling for sensitiviy well spacing and fracture half length in shale gas reservoir. Proved the value of fracture half the length is very influential on the result of the plateau time and hydrocarbon reserves. Well spacing have a tendency to shorten of plateau time, but reaches the optimum value of hydrocarbon revenues. In this thesis also made the relationship between the parameters for prediction. Expected from the discussion in this thesis stimulates for advanced research for real reservoir size and heterogeneous properties.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Aditya Prasetyo": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/232227"}, "Penulis": "Aditya Prasetyo [12210021]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
