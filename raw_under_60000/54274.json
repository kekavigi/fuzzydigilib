{"Nomor": 54274, "Judul": "DESIGN AND NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF ARCHIMEDES SCREW TURBINE WITH 45 CM HEAD AND 25 DEGREES OF INCLINATION ANGLE USING ANSYS FLUENT", "Abstrak": "The screw has been known by the wider community. Screw are widely used in several ways, including as a connector, support, and power plant. Archimedes screw turbine functions as a generator that transmits power from the flow to the generator. The first time the Archimedes screw was used as a pump but over time the Archimedes screw was used for power plant. A significant advantage of the Archimedes screw turbine is that the working area of the Archimedes screw turbine is at a low head. This is very suitable for irrigation conditions or rivers in Indonesia which have low head.\nThe objectives of this undergraduate assignment is to obtain the optimal Archimedes screw turbine design under certain operating conditions. Design modeling is carried out in accordance with design principles. Archimedes screw turbine is simulated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based software to determine turbine performance. The simulation process is carried out at various rotational speeds to determine the optimal point of turbine performance.\nThe simulation results show that of the various turbine rotational speeds, the Archimedes screw turbine with the highest performance is at a rotational speed of 11.68 rad / s. At this rotational speed, the Archimedes screw turbine is capable of producing 17.502 Nm of torque, has an output power of 204.424 Watt and an efficiency of 78.567%.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Hanif Fathurrahman": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/222436", "COVER Hanif Fathurrahman": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/260799", "PUSTAKA Hanif Fathurrahman": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/260805"}, "Penulis": "Hanif Fathurrahman [13116220]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr.-Ing.
