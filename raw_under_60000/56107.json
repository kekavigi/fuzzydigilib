{"Nomor": 56107, "Judul": "A NEW APPROACH TO PRODUCTION FORECASTING USING RNN-LSTM ALGORITHM", "Abstrak": "Production decline analysis is an important aspect of reservoir studies between the middle and the end of their\nproducing lives, as it has a direct impact on the project's future development planning and economic analysis.\nThe use of Arps decline curve analysis models (DCA) has been the standard method to forecast future\nproduction rates in the industry, this is due to its simplicity and reliability. However, this traditional method\ncontains high subjectivity and requires a certain level of expertise to successfully model the production decline\ncurve. It also requires a large amount of manual labor because the method is based on trial and error, this will\ntake longer periods for fields with large numbers of production wells. Data-driven approaches that rely on\nmachine learning algorithms have consistently produced good predictions in the last several years with various\nkinds of oil and gas industry applications, including time-series data. This could be an alternative solution to the\nproblem.\nIn this study, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based algorithm, the Long Short-Term Memory (RNNLSTM)\nmodel will be developed using several production variables such as gas production rate, water\nproduction rate, and wellhead pressure as well constraint. This model will be used to forecast the future 180\ndays of oil production rate based on a set of field historical production time-series data. The forecast result will\nbe then compared with Arps DCA and the actual production data to study both model's performance. Overall,\nthe RNN-LSTM model performed well in comparison with the Arps DCA model, indicating this method might\nbe applied in forecasting production rates and other variables that follow a similar pattern for other field cases.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Venada Ivan Sohahau": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/227587"}, "Penulis": "Venada Ivan Sohahau [12217072]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Amega Yasutra, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "production forecasting, machine learning, LSTM, Arps", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Jun 2021"}
