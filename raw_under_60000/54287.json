{"Nomor": 54287, "Judul": "AXIAL STIFFNESS ANALYSIS OF TAYLOR SPATIAL FRAME DUE TO VARIOUS PRETENSIONS, DIAMETERS, AND DIVERGENCE ANGLES", "Abstrak": "Fracture is a case that frequently occurred in Indonesia. The common causes of fracture in Indonesia are traffic accidents and natural disasters. The treatment methods of a fracture depend on the fracture type. Invasive bone fixation device can be divided into two types which are internal and external device. A more complex fracture requires an external apparatus called the Taylor spatial frame. Biomechanics lab of FTMD ITB has initiated a project to develop Taylor spatial frame bone fixation at an affordable price. A prototype has been manufactured, however, the analysis related to the Taylor spatial frame mechanical behaviour such as its axial stiffness has not been conducted yet.\nTaylor spatial frame consists of rings, struts, cannulated bolts, rancho boxes, wires, and half pins. The SS316L wire and SS317L half pin deformation analysis is conducted using the finite element analysis on Abaqus/CAE. The Taylor spatial frame is modelled as a single ring with wires and half pins that are attached to the ring and implanted to the tibia. Pretensions are subjected to the wire prior to the vertical loading. The simulation is then validated analytically.\nThe relationships of load, pretensions, diameter, divergence angle, and displacement of the wire and the half pin are acquired in the form of graphics and equation. This research concluded that the pretensions that are subjected to the wire increase the axial stiffness of the Taylor spatial frame. Therefore, the displacement of the wire decreases as the pretensions increase. The diameter of the wire and the half pin also affects its displacement. The larger the diameter, the smaller the displacement of the wire. As the divergence angle of the half pin becomes larger, the displacement also becomes smaller.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Ariezka Razanah Riyanto": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/222570"}, "Penulis": "Ariezka Razanah Riyanto [13116056]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
