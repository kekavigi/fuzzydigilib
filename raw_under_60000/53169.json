{"Nomor": 53169, "Judul": "SIMULTANEOUS STATIONARY SCENE IMAGING AND GROUND MOVING TARGET INDICATION FOR HIGH-RESOLUTION WIDE-SWATH SAR SYSTEM", "Abstrak": "In synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, moving\ntargets are usually smeared and/or imaged at incorrect positions\ndue to the target motions during the SAR integration time. Moreover,\nsince a high-resolution wide-swath SAR system is operated\nwith a rather low pulse repetition frequency, a moving target will\ncause multiple ghost targets in the reconstructed SAR image. A\nnew space\u2013time adaptive processing framework is proposed in this\npaper for removing moving target artifacts in SAR images. In this\nnew framework, the dynamic steering vector concept is proposed.\nIn addition, this paper develops amoving target processing scheme\nfor clutter suppression andmoving target imaging and location for\na high-resolution wide-swath SAR system. Finally, we locate the\nwell-focused moving targets at the stationary scene image without\nany disturbing artifacts. The simulated and real data are used to\nvalidate the effectiveness of our proposed method.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xueshi Li [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mengdao Xing, Xiang-Gen Xia, Fellow, IEEE, Guang-Cai Sun, Yi Liang, and Zheng Bao, Life Senior"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "High-resolution wide swath, moving target imaging, moving target location, space\u2013time adaptive processing, stationary scene imaging, synthetic aperture radar (SAR).", "Sumber": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Mar 2021"}
