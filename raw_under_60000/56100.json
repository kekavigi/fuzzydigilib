{"Nomor": 56100, "Judul": "A COMPREHENSIVE MODEL OF SLIMHOLE OF PRODUCTION ZONE OF GEOTHERMAL WELL", "Abstrak": "The application of slimhole of geothermal well, where its final diameter is less than 6\u201d, is based on economic factor, especially when exploration activities and reservoir assessment are conducted. Design of slimhole well is less expensive because the tangible and the intangible costs are lower. However, the slimhole well design has more engineering challenges comparing to conventional well. This study investigates some of the drilling aspects of slimhole well design, especially in production zone using basic concept of drilling engineering and common calculations in the industry. A model of decision making of slimhole well design based on engineering and economic view will be built so that all significant factors that can limit the use of slimhole can be identified and optimized [1].", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Shella Sabielah Mutiara": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/227581"}, "Penulis": "Shella Sabielah Mutiara [12217064]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr.-Ing.
