{"Nomor": 54959, "Judul": "OPENCLIPER: AN OPENCL-BASED C++ FRAMEWORK FOR OVERHEAD-REDUCED MEDICAL IMAGE PROCESSING AND RECONSTRUCTION ON HETEROGENEOUS DEVICES", "Abstrak": "Medical image processing is often limited by\nthe computational cost of the involved algorithms. Whereas\ndedicated computing devices (GPUs in particular) exist and\ndo provide significant efficiency boosts, they have an extra\ncost of use in terms of housekeeping tasks (device selection\nand initialization, data streaming, synchronization\nwith the CPU, and others), which may hinder developers\nfrom using them. This paper describes an OpenCL-based\nframework that is capable of handling dedicated computing\ndevices seamlessly and that allows the developer to concentrate\non image processing tasks. The framework handles\nautomatically device discovery and initialization, data\ntransfers to and from the device and the file system and\nkernel loading and compiling. Data structures need to be\ndefined only once independently of the computing device;\ncode is unique, consequently, for every device, including\nthe host CPU. Pinned memory/buffer mapping is used to\nachievemaximumperformance in data transfers. Code fragments\nincluded in the paper showhowthe computing device\nis almost immediately and effortlessly available to the users\nalgorithms, so they can focus on productive work. Code\nrequired for device selection and initialization, data loading\nand streaming and kernel compilation is minimal and\nsystematic. Algorithms can be thought of as mathematical\noperators (called processes), with input, output and parameters,\nand they may be chained one after another easily and\nefficiently. Also for efficiency, processes can have their initialization\nwork split from their core workload, so process\nchains and loops do not incur in performance penalties.\nAlgorithm code is independent of the device type targeted.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Federico Simmross-Wattenberg [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Manuel Rodr\u00b4?guez-Cayetano, Javier Royuela-del-Val, Elena Mart\u00b4?n-Gonz\u00b4 alez, Elisa Moya-S\u00b4aez, Marcos Mart\u00b4?n-Fern\u00b4andez, and Carlos Alberola-L\u00b4opez"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "C++, GPU, medical imaging, OpenCL.", "Sumber": "IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS, VOL. 23, NO. 4, JULY 2019", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Jun 2021"}
