{"Nomor": 57115, "Judul": "BIAXIAL LOADING ANALYSIS OF LATTICE STRUCTURE FOR AIRCRAFT LITHIUM BATTERY APPLICATION", "Abstrak": "Designing a crashworthy component is a crucial step in designing any\ntransportation, including an aircraft. The use of lattice structure provides multiple\nbenefits especially in the aerospace industry, as lattice structures are lightweight but\nstill offer great strength. Furthermore, lattice structures can disperse heat and generate\nconformal cooling channels to control high temperatures when manufactured using\nadditive manufacturing especially selective laser melting, making them ideal for use in\naircraft electronics protection.\nThis research attempts to improve the safety of aircraft operation along with its\noccupants by advancing the use of lattice structure in battery application. There are\nnumerous geometries of lattice structure such as octet, FCC, BCC, Kagome, cube,\ntetrahedron, octahedron, etc. The goal of this research is establishing the optimum\nlattice geometry for biaxial loads. The lattice structures used in this study are cube,\nKagome, octet and twisted. Each lattice geometry is subjected to five different angle\nplacements which are; 5\u00ba, 10\u00ba, 15\u00ba, 20\u00ba, and 30\u00ba. The lattice structure geometry and\nangle placement that possesses the highest specific energy absorption (SEA) value is\nthen used for application as a container for B787 aircraft battery. The results show that\nthe cube lattice structure with a 5\u00ba placement possesses the highest SEA of 129.32 MPa.\nTherefore, with a lower angle placement the higher its SEA will be and the failure stress\nof the battery will be lower. After applying the cube lattice structure as a battery\ncontainment, it shows that with a lower angle placement, the battery endures less stress\nwhen compared to a higher angle placement. While the advancement of lattice structure\nand its application in numerous industries is a long-range goal, the author trusts that it\nis a worthwhile pursuit to ensure safety operation in the aircraft industry.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Alifah Rahsheita Rahim": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/229721"}, "Penulis": "Alifah Rahsheita Rahim [13617120]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Djarot Widagdo, Ph.D.", "Dr. Annisa Jusuf, S.T., M.T.", "Dr. Ir.
