{"Nomor": 53120, "Judul": "PENGEMBANGAN MATERIAL BAMBU UNTUK DESAIN PANEL AKUSTIK PORTABEL DUA MUKA BAGI AKTIVITAS SIARAN DI RUMAH", "Abstrak": "With the current problems, namely the COVID-19 pandemic, it requires affected\npeople to work, study and worship from home. These activities are carried out through\nonline communication (study and work activities), such as online classes, online\nmeetings, and broadcast activities at home. While there are some problems in doing\nthese activities among which the noise inside and outside the home and the limited\navailability of acoustic space at home. So to overcome this problem, bamboo material\nhas the opportunity to be applied in an online communication system in the form of an\nacoustic panel. Bamboo material has potential as a soundproofing material, by using\na composite technique. Based on the test results, it is known that at the reference\nfrequency (5000 Hz) the composite pulp and bamboo fiber gives a maximum sound\nabsorption coefficient (?) of 0.28 and 0.77, meaning that it can meet the minimum\nstandard of sound absorption coefficient according to ISO 11654: 1997 (? = 0.25),\nespecially bamboo fiber composites, because they are able to reduce sound up to 97%\nat a frequency of 2500 Hz, and lighter with a specific gravity <1 (Theresia Mutia,\n2014). In this research, the acoustic panel development design is made portable which\ncan cover all the functions of the acoustic panel (absorption, diffusion, and reflection)\nand has two faces, with a mixed qualitative exploratory and quantitative research\nmethod regarding the material. Based on the results of experiments that have been\ncarried out in this study, bamboo material can be applied according to the\ncharacteristics of the material, namely for absorption material using bamboo\ncomposite techniques, diffusion material using bamboo meat with lamination\ntechniques, and reflection material using membrane parts in bamboo with cross\nlamination technique. So that it can produce a two-face portable acoustic panel for\nbroadcast activities that can adjust to the conditions of the announcer (user), the\navailable house layout, so that people can continue to work and study at home with\nmaximum and affordable prices.", "Daftar File": {"2021 TS PP OKY SETIAWAN 1.pdf5?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/220355"}, "Penulis": "Oky Setiawan [27118038]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Andar Bagus Sriwarno, S.Sn., M.Sn., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Desain", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Seni Rupa dan Desain", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Bambu, Panel Akustik, Portabel, dua wajah, siaran di rumah.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Feb 2021"}
