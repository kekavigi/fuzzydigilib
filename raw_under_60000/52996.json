{"Nomor": 52996, "Judul": "TRANSFER LEARNING FOR IMAGE SEGMENTATION BY COMBINING IMAGE WEIGHTING AND KERNEL LEARNING", "Abstrak": "Many medical image segmentation methods\nare based on the supervised classification of voxels. Such\nmethods generally perform well when provided with a\ntraining set that is representative of the test images to the\nsegment. However, problems may arise when training and\ntest data follow different distributions, for example, due\nto differences in scanners, scanning protocols, or patient\ngroups. Under such conditions, weighting training images\naccording to distribution similarity have been shown to\ngreatly improve performance. However, this assumes that\na part of the training data is representative of the test data;\nit does not make unrepresentative data more similar. We,\ntherefore, investigate kernel learning as a way to reduce\ndifferences between training and test data and explore\nthe added value of kernel learning for image weighting.\nWe also propose a new image weighting method that minimizes\nmaximum mean discrepancy (MMD) between training\nand test data, which enables the joint optimization of\nimage weights and kernel. Experiments on brain tissue,\nwhite matter lesion, and hippocampus segmentation show\nthat both kernel learning and image weighting, when used\nseparately, greatly improve performance on heterogeneous\ndata. Here, MMD weighting obtains similar performance to\npreviously proposed image weighting methods. Combining\nimage weighting and kernel learning, optimized either individually\nor jointly, can give a small additional improvement\nin performance.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Annegreet van Opbroek [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hakim C.
