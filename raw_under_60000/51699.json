{"Nomor": 51699, "Judul": "EXPERIMENTAL STUDY ON CO-AXIAL SYSTEM WITH A HORIZONTAL WELL OF UNDERGROUND COAL GASIFICATION TO EVALUATE GASIFICATION EFFICIENCY", "Abstrak": "Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) is a technique to recover the energy of coal by\nconverting coal into gas. One or two wells are drilled from the surface to underground\ncoal seam in order to inject oxidant which consists of oxygen and air for burning the\ncoal seam in situ and recover syngas such as carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and methane\nin the surface as an energy source. Unused coal resources which have not been\nrecovered for technical and economic reasons are expected to be used in this\ntechnology. In this research, a large scale experiment which uses an artificial coal block\nwas conducted, and a co-axial UCG system with a horizontal well was adopted to obtain\nresults of temperature in the coal block and product gas components. Based on the\nresults, the amount of reacted coal and gasification efficiency was calculated in order to\nevaluate wether the gasification system worked well or not. Moreover, it was compared\nwith past experimental results for evaluation. Regarding the temperature inside the coal\nblock, the area above the coaxial hole had the highest temperature, with a peak value at\n1200 to 1400 \u00b0C. Furthermore, the peak value at 15 cm above the coaxial hole was 1000\nto 1200 \u00b0C, indicating that the high temperature had expanded up to 15 cm above the\ncoaxial hole. Meanwhile, the main product gas components are nitrogen, carbon\ndioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and methane. Finally, the result of comparing\ngasification efficiency with those of previous experiments shows that the gasification\nefficiency was comparable despite the coal quality is lower than that of the previous\nexperiment.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Yoshimitsu Makabe": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/215370"}, "Penulis": "Yoshimitsu Makabe [22118701]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr.Eng.
