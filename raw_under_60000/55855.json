{"Nomor": 55855, "Judul": "PRODUCTION OF HIGH-QUALITY PORANG GLUCOMANNAN FROM PORANG FLOUR VIA WET MILLING", "Abstrak": "The world is becoming more aware of healthier lifestyles. One of the upcoming healthy\nproducts in Indonesia is shirataki products, which are made from glucomannan. The\nmost known glucomannan source is konjac (Amorphophallus konjac). Konjac\nglucomannan has been used by the Japanese and Chinese since ancient times due to\ntheir versatility. Porang (Amorphophallus muelleri), a plant that abundantly grown in\nIndonesia, is recently becoming well-known to be a good source of glucomannan.\nHowever, with the lack of technology and knowledge, many porang farmers in\nIndonesia sell their crops as dried chips or flour to countries like Japan and China.\nWet milling is one of the widely used methods used for glucomannan extraction and\nethanol being one the common solvents used. In this research, porang flour produced by\nCV. Sanindo Putra will be used as the raw material. Fresh porang tubers are harvested,\nsliced, dried, crushed, milled and polished to produce porang flour. This experiment\nprocesses porang flour via wet milling with the aid of ethanol as solvent. The objective\nof this research is to investigate the effect of length of milling time and ethanol\nconcentration on glucomannan content, chemical composition, viscosity and color of\nthe extracted porang glucomannan (PGM).\nThe variations of this experiment are determined using two-level factorial design with\nthree center points and four corner points. The two main variables which are observed\nin this experiment are ethanol concentration (50%, 70% and 90%) and milling time (5\nmins, 25 mins and 45 mins). The extracted porang glucomannan will then be\ncharacterized using viscometer to analyze viscosity; spectrophotometer to analyze color\nand electronic balance to analyze yield.\nThis experiment has achieved the production of porang glucomannan with a viscosity of\n28,000 cP, a degree of whiteness of 52.63 and a yield of 80.7% while incorporating\n70% ethanol concentration in the wet milling process for 25 minutes.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Samuel Setiawan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/227108"}, "Penulis": "Samuel Setiawan [13017112]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Tjokorde Walmiki Samadhi, S.T., M.T., Ph.D.", "Dr. Dianika Lestari, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknologi Industri", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Porang Glucomannan; Porang Flour; Wet Milling; Color; Viscosity", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Jun 2021"}
