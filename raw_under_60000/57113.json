{"Nomor": 57113, "Judul": "BENDING CRUSH ANALYSIS OF LATTICE STRUCTURE CONFIGURATIONS FOR AIRCRAFT SUBFLOOR APPLICATIONS", "Abstrak": "At present, the developments in transportation show a lot of improvement, including the aircraft industry. However, aircraft accidents still happen that lead to aircraft damage. It can initiate fuselage failure, but the passengers should be entirely safe or not fatally injured after an impact crash. The way to protect them is to design a crash-worthy structure such as an aircraft subfloor.\nThis research aims to do a bending analysis of lattice structure configurations for aircraft subfloor applications. It uses a three-point bending test on lattice configurations to determine Specific Energy Absorption (SEA), force-displacement relationships, and Bending Crush Resistance (BCR). The parametric study is used as a method to obtain the optimum lattice structure configuration. AlSi12 is a material for the cube, 3D-kagome, octet, and twisted-octet geometry as the core of the sandwich beam with three different relative densities on each lattice geometry and two types number of core layers variation in uniform lattice height of 100 mm. Validation based on a reference paper is also done to discover the correct keyword setting for the simulation in LS-DYNA software. Under quasi-static load with a velocity of 6.7 m/s, it is found that the more significant number of core layers generates a better result. After performing the simulation, it shows that the optimum SEA value is 10672.63 J/kg. Its BCR value is 79.38 kNm obtained from octet geometry configuration type 2 with four core layers.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Nabilah Nur Azizah": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/229719"}, "Penulis": "Nabilah Nur Azizah [13617102]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Djarot Widagdo, Ph.D.", "Dr. Annisa Jusuf, S.T., M.T.", "Dr. Ir.
