{"Nomor": 58877, "Judul": "SKEMA KOORDINASI PROTEKSI ADAPTIF PADA SISTEM DISTRIBUSI DENGAN PENETRASI DISTRIBUTED GENERATION", "Abstrak": "Proper design of protection scheme is one of the problems that arise when\ndistributed generation penetration occurs. This is due to the change in in system\ncondition from previously radial to multi-source causing the magnitude and flow of\nthe fault current also change. Therefore, the conventional protection schemes that\ndo not consider the direction of flow become insufficient to protect the system. So\nadaptive protection scheme that can that can adjust its settings dynamically\ndepending on the condition of the system is needed to keep the system safe.\nThe proposed adaptive protection scheme is carried out on the IEEE 3-bus test\nsystem on two conditions, the absence and penetration of distributed generation.\nThe algorithm calculation used MATLAB and then verified by Power Factory 2020\nto clean the 3 phases, 2 phases, phase-ground and 2 phases \u2013 ground fault current.\nThis algorithm also uses contribution current to prevent the occurrence of\nprotection blinding and sympathetic tripping on this protection scheme. The benefit\nof the proposed protection scheme is to maintain selectivity of relay operations\ndespite changes in system topology.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ra Crystal S. P.
