{"Nomor": 59283, "Judul": "SENSITIVITY STUDY OF PERMEABILITY AND POROSITY TO DEVELOP AFFECTED AREA OF COALBED METHANE (CBM) PRODUCTION.", "Abstrak": "Nowadays technology is continuing to improve and able to produce energy from places that weren\u2019t previously possible. This alternative energy called unconventional energy. Coalbed methane which has grown as an important energy resource since the 1980s is one of unconventional energy besides conventional energy such as oil and gas. CBM is a reservoir which has dual porosity system which are macropores and micropores. During the coalification process, large quantities of methane gas are generated and stored within the coal on its micropores. Because coal has a large internal surface area, it can store large amounts of methane-rich gas, or up to six or seven times what conventional natural gas reservoir of equal rock volume can hold. Gas in micropores will only release from the matrix by desorption process that can occur by reducing the reservoir pressure or called dewatering process.\nIn CBM, there is interference or interplay between wells. Unlike a conventional gas reservoir, well interference in a CBM reservoir is an advantageous condition. This is very helpful in the process of production of water so that gas production will also be faster. This study focuses on the analysis of affected area of the reservoir while producing CBM. Sensitivity to be performed are permeability and porosity, both on the fracture system. In each sensitivity, will be performed analyze of three cases which are homogeneous, heterogeneous and random heterogeneous case.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Ilina Yusra": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/232225"}, "Penulis": "Ilina Yusra [12210043]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
