{"Nomor": 53874, "Judul": "DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF CONSTANT TEMPERATURE ANEMOMETER WITH ADJUSTABLE FREQUENCY RESPONSE", "Abstrak": "Hot-wire Anemometry is a tool to measure wind velocity. It is basically a thermal transducer. It operates by putting a very thin filament in a circuit and monitor the heat transfer through the changes in resistance of the filament. This work is concerned on the development of hot-wire anemometer in constant temperature mode. The main goal is to develop a control system to enhance the frequency response control of the system. A new iteration of Constant Temperature Anemometer (CTA) was manufactured improving on previous design, then the frequency response is then compared. Result shows that the frequency response is improved by the added components of the new CTA circuit compared to the old one.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK HANIEF ADNADI": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/221641"}, "Penulis": "HANIEF ADNADI [23617018]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Lavi R.
