{"Nomor": 53315, "Judul": "DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK FOR INVERSE PROBLEMS IN IMAGING", "Abstrak": "In this paper, we propose a novel deep convolutional\nneural network (CNN)-based algorithm for solving ill-posed\ninverse problems. Regularized iterative algorithms have emerged\nas the standard approach to ill-posed inverse problems in the\npast few decades. These methods produce excellent results, but\ncan be challenging to deploy in practice due to factors including\nthe high computational cost of the forward and adjoint operators\nand the difficulty of hyperparameter selection. The starting point\nof this paper is the observation that unrolled iterative methods\nhave the form of a CNN (filtering followed by pointwise nonlinearity)\nwhen the normal operator (H?H, where H? is the\nadjoint of the forward imaging operator, H) of the forwardmodel\nis a convolution. Based on this observation, we propose using\ndirect inversion followed by a CNN to solve normal-convolutional\ninverse problems. The direct inversion encapsulates the physical\nmodel of the system, but leads to artifacts when the problem is\nill posed; the CNN combines multiresolution decomposition and\nresidual learning in order to learn to remove these artifacts while\npreserving image structure. We demonstrate the performance\nof the proposed network in sparse-view reconstruction (down\nto 50 views) on parallel beam X-ray computed tomography in\nsynthetic phantoms as well as in real experimental sinograms.\nThe proposed network outperforms total variation-regularized\niterative reconstruction for the more realistic phantoms and\nrequires less than a second to reconstruct a 512 \u00d7 512 image\non the GPU.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Kyong Hwan Jin [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Michael T.
