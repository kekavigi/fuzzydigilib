Cyclic CO2 injection or known as huff \u201en? puff process has captured more attention as the novelty to increase injection efficiency. Pilot projects that had field scale operation showed an encouraging result. This study focuses on implementing huff \u201en? puff method of CO2 injection to a common condition depicted towards Indonesian reservoir, high temperature and low pressure specifically on recovering light oil type. An enhancing oil recovery examined after cyclic injection project in Meruap Field, Jambi, Indonesia, making this field scale operation as the main support of the proposed injection scenarios and reservoir modelling. Performance evaluation of Meruap was done beforehand and numerical simulator using homogenous cylindrical single well of CMG GEM\u2122 is used as the main method of the simulation. Simulation results has shown that low reservoir pressure condition clearly affects the limit of injection rate applied to reservoir thus limiting the oil recovery while the high temperature decrease the viscosity reduction derivative towards the oil. In the other hand, significant light-oil recovery after injection (16311 bbl), 29.52% is gained with the proposed scenario of 45 days of injection, 50 days of soaking, and 2 MMSCFD (110 ton/day) of injection rate. Thus, this method is encouraging to be further applied to maximize oil recovery in Indonesia.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Fikri Aulia Akbar [12213037]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
