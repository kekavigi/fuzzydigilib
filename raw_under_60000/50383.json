{"Nomor": 50383, "Judul": "COMPUTER-AIDED MANUFACTURING SYSTEM USING YASKAWA MOTOMAN SIA 10D ROBOT", "Abstrak": "Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) systems are traditionally done using NC machines. These machines offer high precision and high structural rigidity. However, they have small workspace in relation to their sizes, and offer limited flexibility when dealing with complex part geometry. As an alternative, robotic machining could be utilized in CAM systems. Robotic arms are particularly suited for low-accuracy, low-force machining processes.\nThis project aims to develop and test a control software and simulation that enable a robotic arm (Motoman SIA 10D) to be utilized in a machining process. Additionally, this project aims to develop the mechanical and electrical aspect of the CAM system. To achieve this, the control system was designed so that the robot can perform 5-axis machining following cutter location data (CL data) written in the Automatic Programmed Tools (APT) language. Three control applications were created, using Visual Studio IDE, MotoPlus IDE, and a robot job. First, CL data are translated into position and orientation. Then, the external PC sends reference points for the robot to follow using an Ethernet cable. The robot then moves according to the reference positions. A kinematic simulation is also developed, using inverse and forward kinematic equations of the robot.\nThe control software was tested using CL data for a conical and spherical tool path. The result shows that the robot was able to follow the points of the CL data in a continuous manner. It was observed that the resulting joint angles are close to the simulation results. Additionally, a machining table design and spindle mount have been developed.", "Daftar File": {"Jaswin - abstrak": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/212772", "COVER Jaswin": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/216595", "BAB 1 Jaswin": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/216596", "BAB 2 Jaswin": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/216597", "BAB 3 Jaswin": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/216598", "BAB 4 Jaswin": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/216599", "BAB 5 Jaswin": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/216600", "BAB 6 Jaswin": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/216601", "PUSTAKA Jaswin": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/216602"}, "Penulis": "Jaswin [13116126]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
