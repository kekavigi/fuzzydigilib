{"Nomor": 53859, "Judul": "DEEP LEARNING IMPLEMENTATION ON AERIAL FLOOD VICTIM DETECTION SYSTEM", "Abstrak": "Hydrometeorological hazards such as floods are considered as a regular natural\ndisaster in Indonesia due to its frequent occurrence. To mitigate the risk, search and\nrescue operations need to be carried out immediately. The sheer magnitude of\nfloods poses a major challenge for responders, and the emerging drone technology\ncould help to alleviate the problem due to its deployment speed and coverage.\nAutomation in drone technology has potential to improve its effectiveness. This\npaper explores the idea of human detection during floods using a computer vision\napproach. This approach utilizes a one stage detector model as detection speed is\ncrucial in disaster management case. The dataset used for training consists of 200\nlabelled and negative images taken from drone point of view. This paper conducted\n3 experiments to find out the difference in performance when the model was trained\non flood and non-flood dataset, as well as the effect of image input size to the\nmodel???????? performance. The first experiment was trained on non-flood dataset. The\nsecond experiment was trained on flood dataset, and the third experiment is the\nmodified version of the second model. The results show that the model trained on\nflood dataset performed worse than non-flood counterparts with the non-flood mAP\nreached 90.80% while flood mAP reached 39.15%. In addition, the experiments\nalso conclude that increasing the input size of image during training, will increase\nthe detection performance of the model at the cost of FPS.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Muhammad Thariq Hidayat": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/221603"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Thariq Hidayat [13616118]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Khairul Ummah ST., MT."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Mesin", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Object Detection, Deep Learning, mAP, Drone, Flood", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Mar 2021"}
