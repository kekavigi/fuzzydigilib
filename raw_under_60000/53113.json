{"Nomor": 53113, "Judul": "LOW-DOSE CT IMAGE DENOISING USING A GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORK WITH WASSERSTEIN DISTANCE AND PERCEPTUAL LOSS", "Abstrak": "The continuous development and extensive\nuse of computed tomography (CT) in medical practice has\nraised a public concern over the associated radiation dose\nto the patient. Reducing the radiation dose may lead to\nincreased noise and artifacts,which can adversely affect the\nradiologists\u2019 judgment and confidence. Hence, advanced\nimage reconstruction from low-dose CT data is needed to\nimprove the diagnostic performance,which is a challenging\nproblem due to its ill-posed nature. Over the past years,\nvarious low-dose CT methods have produced impressive\nresults. However, most of the algorithms developed for\nthis application, including the recently popularized deep\nlearning techniques, aim for minimizing the mean-squared\nerror (MSE) between a denoised CT image and the ground\ntruth under generic penalties. Although the peak signal-tonoise\nratio is improved,MSE- or weighted-MSE-basedmethods\ncan compromise the visibility of important structural\ndetails after aggressive denoising. This paper introduces\na new CT image denoising method based on the generative\nadversarial network (GAN) with Wasserstein distance\nand perceptual similarity. The Wasserstein distance is a key concept of the optimal transport theory and promises\nto improve the performance of GAN. The perceptual loss\nsuppresses noise by comparing the perceptual features of\na denoised output against those of the ground truth in an\nestablished feature space, while the GAN focuses more on\nmigrating the data noise distribution from strong to weak\nstatistically. Therefore, our proposed method transfers our\nknowledge of visual perception to the image denoising task\nand is capable of not only reducing the image noise level but\nalso trying to keep the critical information at the same time.\nPromising results have been obtained in our experiments\nwith clinical CT images.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Qingsong Yang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pingkun Yan , Senior Member, IEEE , Yanbo Zhang , Member, IEEE , Hengyong Yu , Senior Member, IEEE , Yongyi Shi, Xuanqin Mou , Senior Member, IEEE , Mannudeep K.
