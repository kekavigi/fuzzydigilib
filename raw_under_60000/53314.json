{"Nomor": 53314, "Judul": "SYNERGISTIC PET AND SENSE MR IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION USING JOINT SPARSITY REGULARIZATION", "Abstrak": "In this paper, we propose a generalized joint\nsparsity regularization prior and reconstruction framework\nfor the synergistic reconstruction of positron emission\ntomography (PET) and under sampled sensitivity encoded\nmagnetic resonance imaging data with the aim of improving\nimage quality beyond that obtained through conventional\nindependent reconstructions. The proposed prior improves\nupon the joint total variation (TV) using a non-convex\npotential function that assigns a relatively lower penalty for\nthe PET and MR gradients, whose magnitudes are jointly\nlarge, thus permitting the preservation and formation of\ncommon boundaries irrespective of their relative orientation.\nThe alternating directionmethod ofmultipliers (ADMM)\noptimization framework was exploited for the joint PET-MR\nimage reconstruction. In this framework, the jointmaximum\na posteriori objective function was effectively optimized by\nalternating between well-established regularized PET and\nMR image reconstructions. Moreover, the dependency of\nthe joint prior on the PET and MR signal intensities was\naddressed by a novel alternating scaling of the distribution\nof the gradient vectors. The proposed prior was compared\nwith the separate TV and joint TV regularization methods\nusing extensive simulation and real clinical data. In addition,\nthe proposed joint prior was compared with the recently\nproposed linear parallel level sets (PLSs) method using a\nbenchmark simulation data set. Our simulation and clinical\ndata results demonstrated the improved quality of the synergistically\nreconstructed PET-MR images compared with\nthe unregularized and conventional separately regularized\nmethods. It was also found that the proposed prior can outperformboth\nthe jointTV andlinearPLSregularizationmethods\nin assisting edge preservation and recovery of details,\nwhich are otherwise impairedby noise and aliasing artifacts.\nIn conclusion, the proposed joint sparsity regularization\nwithin the presented a ADMM reconstruction framework\nis a promising technique, nonetheless our clinical results\nshowed that the clinical applicability of joint reconstruction\nmight be limited in current PET-MR scanners,mainly due to\nthe lower resolution of PET images.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Abolfazl Mehranian [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Martin A.
