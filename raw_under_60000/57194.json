{"Nomor": 57194, "Judul": "DESIGN AND SIMULATION OF A HYDRAULIC AXIAL TURBINE WITH HEAD TWO METER", "Abstrak": "At present, due to energy crisis circumstances, renewable energy becomes the suitable choice\nof national energy. Hydropower is a clean source of renewable energy. Especially small\nhydropower, the renewable energy which still has large potential and low cost of installation.\nThe turbine of this project is designing and simulation of a low head axial hydraulic turbine\naround 2m due to its low cost, small-sized, the materials used in construction are cheap and\nthe technologies involved are conventional.\nThe methodology of this project consists of designing blades from cascade modelling and\nset up for a simulation for analysis using Computational fluid dynamics which are compared\nto the fundamental calculations. The simulations are done in various rotational speeds and\nmass flow from a model of turbine designed from Solidworks to obtain the desired design\npower around 5-8 kW and used to determined its efficiencies. The results of the simulations\nshow at a rotational speed of 355 rpm and 300 kg/s the efficiency is 73.62 % whereas the\nfundamental calculations result in 78.6 % efficiency. This shows there are other variables\nthat can affect the results of the simulations and the performance of the turbine.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Muhammad Davi Qashmal": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/229841"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Davi Qashmal [13116226]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof.Dr-Ing.Ir Priyono Soetikno,DEA.", "Isnain \u2018Aliman S.T, M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Hydropower, Axial turbine, Cascade modelling, Computational fluid dynamics", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Jul 2021"}
