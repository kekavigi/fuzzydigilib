The development is challenging as remaining reservoirs need technologically advanced handling. VMC field, which has been producing since 1986, is now categorized as a mature field. The field consists of several reservoirs which always been produced commingle until 2015. The commingle production may leave some bypassed reservoirs. V-56 reservoir is suspected to be a bypassed reservoir in the field. It is proven by its initial reservoir pressure after being produced for thirty years. V-56 reservoir is also categorized as low resistivity reservoir with permeability less than 10 md. Based on core and log data, several mechanisms caused the low resistivity and low permeability in V-56 reservoir such as heavy mineral content, fine clay lamination, and chlorite clay mineral. Therefore this paper aims to choose the optimum development of low resistivity pay in V-56 reservoir, VMC Field.\nV-56 DST result, well log review, mineralogy composition and production performance provide guidance to select hydraulic fracturing stimulation with gas lift as the method to increase V-56 reservoir productivity. Production improvement is achieved through sensitivity on three scenarios: hydraulic fracturing, gas lifting, and hydraulic fracturing combined with gas lifting. The V-56 reservoir reserves will be recovered by drilling new well SV-12, and resulted in the incremental oil production of 1447 BOPD with fracture half length of 200 ft, and gas injection rate of 2.5 MMscf / Day.", "Daftar File": {"2018 TA PP VALENTINA MARIA CECILIA 1.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/217419"}, "Penulis": "Valentina Maria Cecilia [12214086]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
