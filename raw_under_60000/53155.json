{"Nomor": 53155, "Judul": "HIGH-THROUGHPUT SPARSITY-BASED INVERSION SCHEME FOR OPTOACOUSTIC TOMOGRAPHY", "Abstrak": "The concept of sparsity is extensively exploited in\nthe fields of data acquisition and image processing, contributing\nto better signal-to-noise and spatio-temporal performance of the\nvarious imaging methods. In the field of optoacoustic tomography,\nthe image reconstruction problem is often characterized\nby computationally extensive inversion of very large datasets, for\ninstance when acquiring volumetric multispectral data with high\ntemporal resolution. In this article we seek to accelerate accurate\nmodel-based optoacoustic inversions by identifying various\nsources of sparsity in the forward and inverse models as well as\nin the single- and multi-frame representation of the projection\ndata. These sources of sparsity are revealed through appropriate\ntransformations in the signal, model and image domains and are\nsubsequently exploited for expediting image reconstruction. The\nsparsity-based inversion scheme was tested with experimental\ndata, offering reconstruction speed enhancement by a factor\nof 40 to 700 times as compared with the conventional iterative\nmodel-based inversions while preserving similar image quality.\nThe demonstrated results pave the way for achieving real-time\nperformance of model-based reconstruction in multi-dimensional\noptoacoustic imaging.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Christian Lutzweiler [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Stratis Tzoumas, Amir Rosenthal, Vasilis Ntziachristos, and Daniel Razansky"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Inverse problems, optoacoustic/photoacoustic imaging, tomography, image reconstruction, sparse signal representation.", "Sumber": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Mar 2021"}
