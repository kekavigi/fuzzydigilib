{"Nomor": 53002, "Judul": "NAVIGATOR-FREE EPI GHOST CORRECTION WITH STRUCTURED LOW-RANK MATRIX MODELS: NEW THEORY AND METHODS", "Abstrak": "Structured low-rank matrix models have previously\nbeen introduced to enable calibrationlessMR image\nreconstruction from sub-Nyquist data, and such ideas\nhave recently been extended to enable navigator-free echoplanar\nimaging (EPI) ghost correction. This paper presents\na novel theoretical analysis which shows that, because\nof uniform subsampling, the structured low-rank matrix\noptimization problems for EPI data will always have either\nundesirable or non-unique solutions in the absence of additional\nconstraints. This theory leads us to recommend and\ninvestigate problem formulations for navigator-free EPI that\nincorporate side information from either image-domain or\nk-space domain parallel imaging methods. The importance\nof using nonconvex low-rank matrix regularization is also\nidentified.We demonstrate using phantom and in vivo data\nthat the proposed methods are able to eliminate ghost\nartifacts for several navigator-free EPI acquisition schemes,\nobtaining better performance in comparison with the stateof-\nthe-art methods across a range of different scenarios.\nResults are shown for both single-channel acquisition and\nhighly accelerated multi-channel acquisition.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Rodrigo A.
