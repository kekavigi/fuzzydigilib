{"Nomor": 50322, "Judul": "POSSIBLE UTILIZATION OF NATUNA RAW GAS FOR ENHANCED COAL BED METHANE RECOVERY", "Abstrak": "One of the largest natural gas fields in Indonesia is Natuna gas field. There is a tremendous gas deposit laying on\nthe reservoir of natuna field, estimated to have over 200 TSCF, making Natuna the largest gas reserve in South\nEast Asia. The produced gas from Natuna is composed predominantly of CO2 (71%), and contains 28% CH4 and\nalso 1% other gas. This large value of CO2 can be utilized to Enhance Oil Recovery or Enhance Coal Bed Methane\nRecovery. Despite the large potential of Natuna gas field, the utilization of this resource is quite small since the\ndominant gas is CO2 so it needed to be separated first. The idea of this study is to directly utilize raw natuna gas\nas injected fluid to enhance coal bed methane recovery.\nThe recovery of coal bed methane is quite small since it is affected by the coal seam pressure and diffusion rate\nthat makes the available gas in the reservoir can\u2019t be fully recovered. By injecting gas to the coal seam, the trapped\ngas on the reservoir can be liberated. Commonly, the injected gas is CO2. The injection of the injected gas might\nincrease methane recovery while reducing gas emissions.\nThis study will show the utilization of Natuna Raw Gas to increase the recovery of Coal Bed Methane and compare\nto the common injected gas for enhancing coal bed methane recovery which is CO2 considering technical and\neconomic evaluation aspects. In the work presented here, the net present value is used to do the economic\nevaluation to optimize the economics of the project.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Mohammad Hamdan Abdillah": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/212635"}, "Penulis": "Mohammad Hamdan Abdillah [12216057]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
