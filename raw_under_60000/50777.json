IN HYPERTENSIVE RATS INDUCED BY DEXAMETHASONE", "Abstrak": "Hypertension is the most common cardiovascular-related medical problems suffered by\ncommunity. Nowadays, herbal remedies are being incorporated into clinical practice of treating\ncardiovascular diseases on the basis of evidence-based medicine. Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.)\nmay be one of the candidates to manage hypertension; however, its mechanism of action has not\nyet been determined. Moreover, information on the uses of herbal medicine proven effectively\nlowering blood pressure is not yet widely available. This study aimed to present literature review\nproviding information on the traditional medicinal plants used for lowering blood pressure and to\nevaluate antihypertensive activity of cucumber fruit in hypertensive rats induced by\ndexamethasone. Literature search on PubMed and Google Scholar using particular keywords and\ninclusive criteria yielded 79 journals for further analysis. Studies suggested that Hibiscus sabdariffa\nL. and Punica granatum L. have shown promising BP reductions. Numerous plants that had been\npreclinically tested still required further study to complete their evaluation and needed cautions\nwhen consumed by hypertensive patients. To evaluate antihypertensive activity, rats were divided\ninto groups, which are given: cucumber 9, 18, 27, or 36 mg/kg bw, amlodipine 0.45 mg/kg bw as\nstandard or a combination of cucumber 36 mg/kg and amlodipine 0.45 mg/kg bw orally. BP was\nmeasured using CODA\u00ae tail-cuff blood pressure system, and data was analyzed statistically using\nSPSS software. Result indicated cucumber has antihypertensive activity that increases with\nincreasing dosage that is inferior to amlodipine. Combination of cucumber and amlodipine failed to\ndemonstrate more significant BP reductions, suggesting an indifference interaction.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Syifa Fauziah": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/213436"}, "Penulis": "Syifa Fauziah [11616105]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["apt.
