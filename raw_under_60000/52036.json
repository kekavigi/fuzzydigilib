{"Nomor": 52036, "Judul": "ROLE OF PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION (PSD) IN UNIAXIAL AND CONTINUOUS BINDERLESS BRIQUETTING PROCESS OF INDONESIAN MIDDLE-RANK COAL", "Abstrak": "Coal upgrading process generally results in dried coal powder with certain Particle Size Distribution (PSD). Briquetting process is often performed on upgraded coal to improve its transportation and storage properties. In binderless briquetting, coal PSD is a significant parameter that could affect the product quality. This thesis was aimed to study the role of PSD in both uniaxial and continuous binderless briquetting process of Indonesian middle-rank coal.\nRole of PSD in uniaxial briquetting was studied by using bimodal mixtures of coal powder with different composition of PSD Small and Large particles (%L). Compaction characteristics and briquette quality, in terms of density and strength, were analyzed. Mixture 70%L was considered as the hardest to deform during briquetting. On the other hand, the best briquette quality was produced in mixture 0%L (PSD Small). Coal PSD could affect the compaction phenomenon and briquette quality as it varies the contact area between particles during briquetting.\nRole of PSD in continuous briquetting was studied by assessing roll-press compaction parameters using basic powder characteristics of PSD Small and Large. Johanson\u2019s equation was adapted to find roll-press compaction parameters, i.e., nip angle and pressure distribution. Both PSDs have similar powder characteristics which yielded similar roll press-parameters at certain roll operation setup. Coal PSD does not significantly affect roll-press parameters. The strength of briquette, however, was affected by coal PSD in similar manner as in uniaxial briquetting.\nFinally, the strength of PSD Small and Large briquette produced in uniaxial (-U) and continuous (-C) briquetting process was compared. Large-C briquette had higher overall strength compared to Large-U briquette, while the opposite was true for PSD Small briquette. It is predicted that continuous briquetting process could be advantageous for material that can undergo secondary compaction cycle after particles fragmentation.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Fajar Fathiawan Pambudi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/217665"}, "Penulis": "Fajar Fathiawan Pambudi [23118021]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
