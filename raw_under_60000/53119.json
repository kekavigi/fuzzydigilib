{"Nomor": 53119, "Judul": "A SIMPLE MEASURE FOR ACUITY IN MEDICAL IMAGES", "Abstrak": "An automatic and objective assessment of image\nquality is important in an era, where large-scale processing of\nimaging data from multi-center studies becomes commonplace.\nBased on a comprehensive statistical image model that includes\nnoise and blur, a measure for image acuity is derived here as\nthe ratio of the maximal gradient magnitude and the intensity\ndifference at a boundary. Acuity may be affected by the object\nunder study, the image acquisition, reconstruction processes, and\nany post-processing steps. The acuity measure presented here is\npost-hoc, intuitive to understand, simple to compute, and easily\nintegrates with other standard measures of image quality. Three\napplications in medical imaging are included where our acuity\nmeasure is useful in the objective and automatic assessment of\nimage quality.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Frithjof Kruggel [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Image quality, image artifacts, motion, medical imaging.", "Sumber": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Feb 2021"}
