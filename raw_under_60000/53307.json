{"Nomor": 53307, "Judul": "MR IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION USING A COMBINATION OF COMPRESSED SENSING AND PARTIAL FOURIER ACQUISITION: ESPRESSO", "Abstrak": "A Cartesian subsampling scheme is proposed incorporating\nthe idea of PF acquisition and variable-density Poisson\nDisc (vdPD) subsampling by redistributing the sampling space\nonto a smaller region aiming to increase k-space sampling\ndensity for a given acceleration factor. Especially the normally\nsparse sampled high-frequency components benefit from this\nsampling redistribution, leading to improved edge delineation.\nThe prospective subsampled and compacted k-space can be\nreconstructed by a seamless combination of a CS-algorithm with\na Hermitian symmetry constraint accounting for the missing\npart of the k-space. This subsampling and reconstruction scheme\nis called Compressed Sensing Partial Subsampling (ESPReSSo)\nand was tested on in-vivo abdominal MRI datasets. Different\nreconstruction methods and regularizations are investigated and\nanalyzed via global (intensity-based) and local (region-of-interest\nand line evaluation) image metrics, to conclude a clinical feasible\nsetup. Results substantiate that ESPReSSo can provide improved\nedge delineation and regional homogeneity for multidimensional\nand multi-coil MRI datasets and is therefore useful in applications\ndepending on well-defined tissue boundaries, such as image\nregistration and segmentation or detection of small lesions in\nclinical diagnostics.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "T.
