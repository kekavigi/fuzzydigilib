{"Nomor": 54489, "Judul": "PERENCANAAN BANGUNAN PELINDUNG PANTAI DI KECAMATAN LEMONG, KABUPATEN PESISIR BARAT, PROVINSI LAMPUNG", "Abstrak": "Indonesia is one of the countries with the longest coastline in the world. This long coastline has a variety of characteristics and has a lot of potential which can be developed or exploited. However, it also has the potential to harm humans, such as the coastal erosion that take place in Lemong. That coastal area, which is located in Pesisir Barat, Lampung, is connected to the Indian Ocean. There, the incoming waves are able to erode the coastal area, causing damage to public facilities and disrupting the activities of the surrounding population. Therefore, the shore protection structure is needed to overcome this problem.\nThe shore protection planning is carried out with the help of shoreline change simulation through a software called Coastal Engineering Design and Analysis System (CEDAS), Nearshore Evolution Modeling System (NEMOS). The use of software for the simulation is focused on Generalized Model for Simulating Shoreline Change (GENESIS) of Nearshore Evolution Modeling System (NEMOS). The outcome of the simulation is taken into consideration in selecting the type of shore protection structure to be used. The shore protection planning is completed with design calculations that is suitable to solve the coastal problem in Lemong.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Adelpho Ocshar Balaw": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/222911"}, "Penulis": "Adelpho Ocshar Balaw [15513043]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
