{"Nomor": 53489, "Judul": "THE EFFECT OF IMPLEMENTING THE INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IN SEAWATER DESALINATION PLANTS IN CONFLICT ZONES: CASE STUDY ON THE GAZA STRIP", "Abstrak": "Water scarcity is a universal problem that affects all life aspects, especially in\nconflict zones. The Gaza Strip has long suffered from potable water scarcity, which\ncomes as a result of the excessive withdrawal of groundwater from the coastal\naquifers, the intrusion of seawater and the agricultural runoffs into the aquifers.\nMany solutions had been pursued to solve the problem including purchasing potable\nwater from the Mekorot (an Israeli water company) and the construction of the three\nseawater desalination plants. The Integrated Management System would be\nproposed as a tool to enhance the performance. Thereby this study aims to assess\nthe potentials of applying the Integrated Management System in seawater\ndesalination plants (SDP\u2019s).\nThe study used qualitative and quantitative methods, in which secondary data were\ncollected from previous studies, reports and journals, including in terms of\necological data related to the impact of this system. Primary data were collected\nthrough a questionnaire survey to project managers, consultants and personnel in\nauthorities of the water sector. The data obtained from the questionnaires were\nanalyzed using SPSS program, as a basis to analyze the impact of applying the IMS\nin seawater desalination plants and the barriers of its implementation. A SWOT\nanalysis was used to design the implementation strategies. From 32 respondents,\nthe result showed that there are positive impacts of applying the IMS on the\nfinancial, administrative, technical, environmental, and socio-economic\nperformance of the desalination plants, with 28.1 to 75% of the respondents\nagreeing to the positive impacts. Biologically, the physicochemical water quality\nanalysis results showed that the water quality from seawater desalination plants is\ncompatible with PWA and WHO standards, unlike many private desalination\nplants. Furthermore, the study identified 12 barriers that might obstruct the\napplication of the IMS in SDP\u2019s. Further SWOT analysis mapped the potentials,\nstakeholders\u2019 responses, and barriers as internal/ external factors that determine the\ntype of strategies to be implemented for the system. Hereby, the highest priority\nstrategy is the formation of a partnership with the UN institutions to obtain\ninternational protection and facilitate the entry of the required materials.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Zainab Naim Ahmad Matar": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/220969", "COVER Zainab Naim Ahmad Matar": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/255131", "PUSTAKA Zainab Naim Ahmad Matar": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/255137", "LAMPIRAN Zainab Naim Ahmad Matar": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/255138"}, "Penulis": "Zainab Naim Ahmad Matar [21319701]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Gede Suantika, S.Si., M.Si.", "Angga Dwiartama, S.Si., M.Si., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Biomanajemen", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Ilmu dan Teknologi Hayati", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Gaza Strip, IMS, Scarcity, Strategy, Water", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "9 file", "Tanggal Input": "05 Mar 2021"}
