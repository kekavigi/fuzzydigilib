{"Nomor": 54963, "Judul": "WEAKLY SUPERVISED ESTIMATION OF SHADOW CONFIDENCE MAPS IN FETAL ULTRASOUND IMAGING", "Abstrak": "Detecting acoustic shadows in ultrasound\nimages is important in many clinical and engineering\napplications. Real-time feedback of acoustic shadows can\nguide sonographers to a standardized diagnostic viewing\nplane with minimal artifacts and can provide additional\ninformation for other automatic image analysis algorithms.\nHowever, automatically detecting shadow regions\nusing learning-based algorithms is challenging because\npixel-wise ground truth annotation of acoustic shadows\nis subjective and time consuming. In this paper, we propose\na weakly supervisedmethod for automatic confidence\nestimation of acoustic shadow regions. Our method is\nable to generate a dense shadow-focused confidence map.\nIn our method, a shadow-seg module is built to learn general\nshadow features for shadow segmentation, based on\nglobal image-level annotations as well as a small number of\ncoarse pixel-wise shadow annotations. A transfer function\nis introducedto extend the obtainedbinary shadowsegmentation\nto a reference confidence map. In addition, a confidence\nestimation network is proposed to learn the mapping\nbetween input images and the reference confidence maps.\nThis network is able to predict shadow confidence maps\ndirectly from input images during inference. We use evaluation\nmetrics such as DICE, inter-class correlation, and so\non, to verify the effectiveness of our method. Our method\nis more consistent than human annotation and outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art quantitatively in shadow segmen-\ntation and qualitatively in confidence estimation of shadow\nregions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of\nour method by integrating shadow confidence maps into\ntasks such as ultrasound image classification, multi-view\nimage fusion, and automated biometric measurements.\n.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Qingjie Mengnz [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Matthew Sinclair, Veronika Zimmer , Benjamin Hou, Martin Rajchl , Nicolas Toussaint, Ozan Oktay , Jo Schlemper , Alberto Gomez , James Housden, Jacqueline Matthew, Daniel Rueckert, Julia A.
