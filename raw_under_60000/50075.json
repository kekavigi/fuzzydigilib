Dire consequences of this material failure in said\napplication motivates research in finding ways to detect structural damage. One of the\nmethods is electrical resistance change method (ERC Method). Structural damage yields\nhigher resistance when measured. This method can be employed in the development of\nstructural health monitoring (SHM) system in an effort to increase structural reliability.\nThis research aims to use ERC method to identify crack length and orientation in\nCFRP plate. Firstly experimental and simulation model of a CFRP specimen is compared to\nobtain a representative model. Next, using the same conductivity property, a plate model is\nbuilt with various crack length and orientation to obtain resistance value. A surface of\nresistance as function of crack length and orientation can then be built using surface fitting.\nFinally a program to predict crack length and orientation is developed.\nBulk specimen model proves to be capable of approximating experimental\nmeasurement accurately. Resistance surface can be built using a certain toolbox from\nMATLAB. Program can be developed using the same software.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Kevin Putra Adiwijna [13116145]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
