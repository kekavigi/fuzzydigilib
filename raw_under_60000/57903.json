{"Nomor": 57903, "Judul": "AKTIVITAS BIOSURFAKTAN F7 SEBAGAI AGEN ANTI-BIOFILM BAKTERI GRAM POSITIF DAN NEGATIF SERTA PENGARUHNYA TERHADAP BIOKOROSI CARBON STEEL ST 37 PADA WATER COOLING SYSTEM", "Abstrak": "The water cooling system is one of the most important units in the\nindustry. This is because in the cooling system, a heat exchange process\noccurs to lower water temperature caused by overheating which can\nresult in decreased effectiveness and damaged machinery in\nmanufacturing. However, temperature alteration and organic matter in\nwater cooling systems can support the growth of microbes such as\nbiofilm-forming microbes. The biofilm formed in the cooling water\nsystem can accelerate biocorrosion, therefore a compound that can\ninhibit and eradicate the forming of biofilms is needed. Biosurfactant is\none of the potential compounds that can be used to eradicate biofilms\nbecause it has anti-adhesion, and anti-biofilm activity, is easily\ndegradable, non-toxic, and can be used over a wide range of conditions.\nTherefore, this study aims to determine the activity of biosurfactant F7\nas an anti-adhesion and anti-biofilm on gram-positive and gram-negative\nbacterial biofilms by determining the MBIC and MBEC values and their\neffect on the corrosion rate of Carbon Steel ST 37. This research was\nconducted by constructing a biofilm formation curve from single\ncultures of isolates 1 (gram-positive bacteria) and 5 (gram-negative\nbacteria) on Carbon Steel ST 37 with general medium Nutrient Broth. In\naddition, the activity of biosurfactant F7 as an anti-biofilm was\ndetermined by determining the value of MBIC and MBEC on biofilm\nisolates 1 and 5. The MBIC and MBEC values were determined by\nmeasuring the wet weight of the biofilm formed. Meanwhile, the steel\ncorrosion rate was carried out by measuring of the decrease in steel mass. The results of this study indicate that the maturation time of\nbiofilm is 6 days for gram-positive bacteria and 3 days for gramnegative\nbacteria. In addition, the MBIC and MBEC values of\nbiosurfactant F7 were 28.5 ppm and 570 ppm. After being given\nbiosurfactant treatment with 28.5 ppm concentration, the corrosion rate\nof Carbon Steel ST 37 which was incubated by isolates 1 and 5 showed\na decrease of 0.02321 mm/year and 0.01547 mm/year if compared to the\nuntreated control. Meanwhile, the addition of the biocide glutaraldehyde\nas much as 0.5% (v/v) caused the corrosion rate of 0.02063 mm/year\nand 0.00773 mm/year. Therefore, based on this study, it can be\nconcluded that F7 biosurfactant is more effective in inhibiting\nbiocorrosion on Carbon Steel ST 37 when compared to glutaraldehyde.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Yuvita Elvarina Fatimah": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/231551"}, "Penulis": "Yuvita Elvarina Fatimah [10417017]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Dea Indriani Astuti, S.Si.", "Dr.Eng.
