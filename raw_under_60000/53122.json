{"Nomor": 53122, "Judul": "SOFTWARE-BASED REAL-TIME ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING OF PET DETECTOR RAW DATA", "Abstrak": "In modern positron emission tomography (PET)\nreadout architectures, the position and energy estimation of scintillation\nevents (singles) and the detection of coincident events\n(coincidences) are typically carried out on highly integrated,\nprogrammable printed circuit boards. The implementation of\nadvanced singles and coincidence processing (SCP) algorithms\nfor these architectures is often limited by the strict constraints\nof hardware-based data processing. In this paper, we present\na software-based data acquisition and processing architecture\n(DAPA) that offers a high degree of flexibility for advanced SCP\nalgorithms through relaxed real-time constraints and an easily extendible\ndata processing framework. The DAPA is designed to\nacquire detector raw data from independent (but synchronized)\ndetector modules and process the data for singles and coincidences\nin real-time using a center-of-gravity (COG)-based, a leastsquares\n(LS)-based, or a maximum-likelihood (ML)-based crystal\nposition and energy estimation approach (CPEEA). To test the\nDAPA, we adapted it to a preclinical PET detector that outputs\ndetector raw data from 60 independent digital silicon photomultiplier\n(dSiPM)-based detector stacks and evaluated it with a [18 F]-\nfluorodeoxyglucose-filled hot-rod phantom. The DAPA is highly\nreliable with less than 0.1% of all detector raw data lost or corrupted.\nFor high validation thresholds (37.1 \u00b1 12.8 photons per\npixel) of the dSiPM detector tiles, the DAPA is real time capable\nup to 55 MBq for the COG-based CPEEA, up to 31 MBq for the\nLS-based CPEEA, and up to 28 MBq for the ML-based CPEEA.\nCompared to the COG-based CPEEA, the rods in the image reconstruction\nof the hot-rod phantom are only slightly better separable\nand less blurred for the LS- and ML-based CPEEA.While the coincidence\ntime resolution (?550 ps) and energy resolution (?12.3%) are comparable for all three CPEEA, the system sensitivity is up\nto 2.5\u00d7 higher for the LS- and ML-based CPEEA.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Benjamin Goldschmidt [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["David Schug, Christoph W.
