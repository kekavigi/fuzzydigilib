{"Nomor": 54935, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT OF RISK ESTIMATION MODEL FOR COVID-19 TRANSMISSION ON PASSENGER HANDLING PROCESS IN AIRPORT TERMINAL", "Abstrak": "The number of people infected by the COVID-19 in the world continues to increase significantly until now. Transportation places are one of the places where the virus is transmitted most. As its characteristics, air transport has greatest contributor among all transportation modes. This study combines two models from previous research that can be used to estimate the virus transmission risk in passenger handling process in airport terminal. The model developed based on Wells\u2013Riley equation, and then considering of the effects of wearing mask, passenger distancing (or density in a lounge), exposure time and types of pre-flight COVID-19 testing on the risk of transmission of COVID-19. It showed that the risk of virus transmission is influenced by the wearing mask, the type of pre-flight COVID-19 test, physical distancing (or room density), exposure time, and air circulation (ventilation) type in lounge. It is hoped that this paper can be used to manage the COVID-19 transmission risk as low as can be accepted.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Reyhan Fadyla Rohmana": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/224948"}, "Penulis": "Reyhan Fadyla Rohmana [13617122]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
