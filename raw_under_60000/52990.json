{"Nomor": 52990, "Judul": "NANOPARTICLES: PROPERTIES, APPLICATIONS AND TOXICITIES", "Abstrak": "This review is provided a detailed overview of the synthesis, properties and applications\nof nanoparticles (NPs) exist in different forms. NPs are tiny materials having size ranges from 1 to\n100 nm. They can be classified into different classes based on their properties, shapes or sizes. The\ndifferent groups include fullerenes, metal NPs, ceramic NPs, and polymeric NPs. NPs possess\nunique physical and chemical properties due to their high surface area and nanoscale size. Their\noptical properties are reported to be dependent on the size, which imparts different colors due to\nabsorption in the visible region. Their reactivity, toughness and other properties are also dependent\non their unique size, shape and structure. Due to these characteristics, they are suitable candidates\nfor various commercial and domestic applications, which include catalysis, imaging, medical applications,\nenergy-based research, and environmental applications. Heavy metal NPs of lead, mercury\nand tin are reported to be so rigid and stable that their degradation is not easily achievable, which\ncan lead to many environmental toxicities.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ibrahim Khan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Khalid Saeed, Idrees Khan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Nanoparticles; Fullerenes; Optical; Plasmonic; Toxicity", "Sumber": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878535217300990", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Feb 2021"}
