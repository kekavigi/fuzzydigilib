{"Nomor": 54960, "Judul": "EFFICIENT JOINT IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION OF MULTI-PATCH DATA REUSING A SINGLE SYSTEM MATRIX IN MAGNETIC PARTICLE IMAGING", "Abstrak": "Due to peripheral nerve stimulation, the magnetic\nparticle imaging (MPI) method is limited in the maximumapplicableexcitation-\nfieldamplitude. This in turn leads\nto a limitation of the size of the covered field of view (FoV)\nto few millimeters. In order to still capture a larger FoV,\nMPI is capable to rapidly acquire volumes in a multi-patch\nfashion. To this end, the small excitation volume is shifted\nthrough space using the magnetic focus fields. Recently,\nit has been shown that the individual patches are preferably\nreconstructed in a joint fashion by solving a single linear\nsystem of equations taking the coupling between individual\npatches into account. While this improves the image\nquality, it is computationally and memory demanding since\nthe size of the linear system increases in the best case\nquadratically with the number of patches. In this paper,\nwe will develop a reconstruction algorithm for MPI multipatch\ndata exploiting the sparsity of the joint systemmatrix.\nA highly efficient implicit matrix format allows for rapid onthe-\nfly calculations of linear algebra operations involving\nthe system matrix. Using this approach, the computational\neffort can be reduced to a linear dependence on the number\nof used patches. The algorithm is validated on 3-D multipatch\nphantom data sets and shown to reconstruct large\ndata sets with 15 patches in less than 22 s.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Patryk Szwargulski [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Martin M\u00f6ddel , Nadine Gdaniec , and Tobias Knopp"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Biomedical imaging, focus fields, image reconstruction, magnetic particle imaging.", "Sumber": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING, VOL. 38, NO. 4, APRIL 2019", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Jun 2021"}
