Evaluation is also carried out to estimate the age of the reservoir based on its production data. This is important because a reservoir that has been produced will experience a decrease in its production rate over time. Several methods for predicting a well\u2019s performance include material balance, decline curve analysis, volumetric calculation, and reservoir simulation.\nThe \"K\" field is a dry gas production well which over time experiences a decrease in reservoir pressure so that in the end the reservoir is no longer able to push gas into the well\u2019s. Therefore, a method is used to overcome this problem, namely by installing a wellhead compressor. Next, forecasting of future well\u2019s production is carried out. In this work, the Decline Curve Analysis method is used to obtain the lifetime and cumulative production of the \"K\" field.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Siti Noor Aisyah": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/231468"}, "Penulis": "Siti Noor Aisyah [12217016]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
