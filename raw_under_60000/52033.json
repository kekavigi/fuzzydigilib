{"Nomor": 52033, "Judul": "SURROGATE AND MACHINE LEARNING MODELS FOR MULTI-POINT TURBOMACHINE FAN BLADE DESIGN PARAMETERS", "Abstrak": "Modern turbomachine blade shape designs typically are parameterized by a set of\nhigh-dimensional design variables ranging from 20 to 250 dimensions. These design\nparameters are useful for aerodynamic, structural and manufacturing design\npurposes. But it is acknowledged that the latter has a very high cost in the design\nprocess and lacks flexibility as it demands high computational resources. Nowadays,\nsurrogate models are considered as an important role in parametric studies\nsuch as optimization, design exploration, and sensitivity analysis that used to be\nchallenging and computationally exhaustive. By utilizing the so-called black box\nmodel as where the prediction takes place surrogate models were approved as a\nrobust method in order to give lower cost and broader flexibility in parametric\nstudies. In this undergraduate thesis, the performance of three surrogate models\nare presented and compared, such as; Kriging, Support Vector Regression (SVR),\nand Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), with additional Linear Regression as a\nbenchmark for analyzing the data set. The performance metrics are compared in\nRoot Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared (R2) in boxplots with 30 iterations.\nThe presented RMSE is normalized with Interquartile Range (IQR) and\nR2 is presented in 1  R2 for better visualization for comparison purposes. From\nall of the results, Kriging proves as the best model with the most desirable prediction\nresults based on the evaluation metrics with a trade off of computationally\nexhaustive resources. SVR comes second with a decent results and curiously overfitting\ntendency towards large training data points. Lastly, GBR fails to present\nexciting results as it gives relatively poor results in general even compared to the\nbenchmark of Linear Regression.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Bagas Adhikaputera": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/217659"}, "Penulis": "Bagas Adhikaputera [13616075]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Lavi Rizki Zuhal", "Pramudita Satria Palar, S.T., M.T., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "turbomachine fan blade", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Jan 2021"}
