As a result, the adaptive capacity is now seen as an\nimportant element of long-term adaptation to respond to the complex and uncertain\nelement in climate change. This study analysed whether the quality of adaptive\ncapacity possessed within institutions can allow and encourage the community to\nadapt to complex and uncertain climate change impact through CBA practice. This\nstudy chooses DKI Jakarta, Indonesia, as a case study that is now actively engaged\nin the national program's so-called climate-village program' (Proklim). This\nprogram highly relies on CBA practice for climate adaptation actions. The\ninstitutions adaptive capacity investigation undertaken in Malakasari and Cempaka\nPutih Timur village in DKI Jakarta Province. The institution adaptive capacity is\nanalysed under two layers at the local level: the local government and the\ncommunity. The findings show that the institutions have not achieved a desirable\nadaptive capacity state in a way the literature argues. Nevertheless, the existing\nquality of adaptive capacity within institutions can improve the CBA practice at the\nneighbourhood level. The analysis uncovers that the difficulty lies more heavily in\nbuilding adaptive capacity at the community level. The tension between bottom-up\nand top-down approaches in Proklim implementation seems to hamper the\ncommunity's ability to improvise, respond more flexibly, and made contextappropriate climate adaptation actions.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Azka Nur Medha": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214649", "BAB 1 Azka Nur Medha": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214650", "BAB 2 Azka Nur Medha": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214651", "BAB 3 Azka Nur Medha": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214653", "BAB 4 Azka Nur Medha": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214654", "BAB 5 Azka Nur Medha": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214655", "BAB 6 Azka Nur Medha": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214656", "DAFTAR Azka Nur Medha": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214658", "2020 TS PP AZKA NUR MEDHA_LAMPIRAN.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/214659"}, "Penulis": "Azka Nur Medha [25418005]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
