In this\nway, information about the underlying anatomy is shared\nduring the image reconstruction process while unique differences\nare preserved.Results from numerical simulations\nand in-vivo experiments using a range of accelerated MR\nacquisitions and different MR image contrasts demonstrate\nimproved PET image quality, resolution, and quantitative\naccuracy.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Florian Knoll [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Martin Holler, Thomas Koesters, Ricardo Otazo, Kristian Bredies, and Daniel K Sodickson"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Iterative image reconstruction, MR-PET, multi-modality imaging, total generalized variation, variational regularization methods.", "Sumber": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "03 Mar 2021"}
