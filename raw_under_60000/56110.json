{"Nomor": 56110, "Judul": "ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY SCREENING METHOD WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BASED ON FUZZY LOGIC ALGORITHM", "Abstrak": "This study is related to the development of the EOR screening program using Fuzzy Logic. To decide the best\nEOR strategy in the oil field with minimal human error, a robust and easy-to-use program with precise and fast\nresults. The technique uses Python programming language to apply the basic concept of Fuzzy Logic. The results\nshow that the program functions well and fulfills the assumptions. This depends on the fair and square of\ncomparability because the test uses contextual analysis in the field contained in the paper. For additional\nexploration, it is advisable to consider economic factors, field conditions with unique substances, e.g., high levels\nof paraffin, etc., which are helpful to broaden the accuracy of the EOR method.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Ahmad Nur Alifullah": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/227590"}, "Penulis": "Ahmad Nur Alifullah [12217074]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zuher Syihab, S.T., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Screening EOR, Python Programming, Artificial Intelligence, Fuzzy Logic.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Jun 2021"}
