{"Nomor": 56103, "Judul": "INTERPRETATION OF LAHENDONG TRACER TEST DATA USING MOMENT ANALYSIS METHOD TO REEVALUATE THE REINJECTION STRATEGY", "Abstrak": "Reinjection is imperative to establish proper field management and help to maintain the sustainability of geothermal energy resources. Tracer test could become a solution to evaluate the reinjection plan by investigating subsurface flow paths, characterizing subsurface flow, and analyzing well inter-connectivity. The study's objectives are to interpret and analyze Lahendong tracer test data using the moment analysis method to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the INE-1 injection strategy's impact on the flow medium characteristics and the thermal breakthrough of 7 observed production wells. This method is based on an analysis of the mean residence time of the tracer. Several calculations of moment analysis variables such as pore volume swept, residence time, sweep efficiency, heterogeneity, and flow geometry are performed using a spreadsheet. Subsequently, the results will be compared for every observed production well to know which production well is the most affected by INE-1 injection. Based on the thermal breakthrough calculation, the temperature drop of the production wells is known to be insignificant, under 0.01\u00b0C for 30 years on average; thus, it has been identified that the production temperature will not be affected by the current injection strategy in INE-1.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Baida Iqlima": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/227584", "2021 TA PP BAIDA IQLIMA 1.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/228958"}, "Penulis": "Baida Iqlima [12217068]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Heru Berian Pratama, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Lahendong injection, tracer test, moment analysis, reinjection strategy, thermal breakthrough, flow medium characteristic", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Jun 2021"}
