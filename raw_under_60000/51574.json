{"Nomor": 51574, "Judul": "COMPUTATIONAL APPROACHES ON THE CORROSION INHIBITION PERFORMANCE OF RAMBUTAN SEED AND PEEL EXTRACT ON LOW-CARBON STEEL IN AQUEOUS SOLUTION: DENSITY FUNCTIONAL THEORY AND MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATION", "Abstrak": "Corrosion inhibitor is widely used for corrosion control in industrial processes that\ninvolve solution such as in water treatment, oil & gas refineries, etc. In the last\ndecades, the search of effective yet biodegradable corrosion inhibitor for lowcarbon\nsteel has been a crucial topic ever since environmental issue \u2013 from using\nconventional inhibitior - emerges as a critical concern. To this idea, the use of\nnatural source e.g agricultural wastes, drugs, and plant extracts have widely gained\nsignificant attention because of the presence of heterocyclic constituents from\nbioactive compounds that is essential as good corrosion inhibitor. Based on the\nfact that Indonesia is rich in tropical fruits of several species, one of which is\nrambutan, the corrosion inhibition performance of some phenolic compounds exist\nin rambutan (Nephelium Lappaceum) seed and peel extract (RSPE) was studied.\nTheoretical approaches using computational chemistry methods i.e density\nfunctional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation were carried\nout to invesitigate the inhibition mechanism at molecular level of some phenolic\ncompounds of rambutan seed and peel on low-carbon steel in aqueous solution.\nDFT approach was done using B3LYP/6-311G** basis sets to reveal the reactive\nsites and eigenvalues of electronic parameters from the molecules studied. MD\nsimulation was conducted at 298 K controlled by Berendsen thermostat in water\nsolvents of 300 molecules using NVT ensemble to examine the adsorption\nmechanism and their interaction with the metal surfaces. To verify and validate\nthat the simulation results reflect the real behaviour of the molecules, postprocessing\nand comparative study with available relevant literature were done.\nBased on the results, some phenolic compounds of rambutan seed and peel are soluble\nin water, indicating application in aqueous solution are possible. DFT-based\ncalculation shows that all molecules are capable to interact through donor-acceptor\nelectron with EHOMO and ELUMO eigenvalues vary from -4.9 to -6.1 eV and -1.1 to - 3.2\neV, respectively. Hereafter, MD simulation reveals that all molecules studied were\nable to be spontaneously adsorbed by chemisorption and physisorption onto iron\nsurface and serve as protection layer from corrosive media at room temperature with\ninteraction energy (Einteraction) varies from -87 to -459 kcal/mol. Finally, in accordance\nto the simulation results and comparative study, EHOMO and amount of oxygen atom\nappears to be the most appropriate descriptors to the estimation of inhibition\nperformance and adsorption strength of C-H-O molecule, respectively.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Daniel Sahalatua Pardosi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/215134"}, "Penulis": "Daniel Sahalatua Pardosi [12516058]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr.Eng.
