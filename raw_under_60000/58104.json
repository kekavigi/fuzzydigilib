{"Nomor": 58104, "Judul": "MOLECULAR MIMICRY BETWEEN SARS CORONAVIRUS SPIKE PROTEIN AND HUMAN PROTEIN", "Abstrak": "Molecular mimicry defined as similar structures\nshared by molecules from dissimilar genes or by their\nprotein products, is a general strategy for pathogens\nto infect host cells. Therefore, identification of the\nmolecular mimic regions of a pathogen may be helpful\nto understand the disease. Severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome (SARS) is a new human respiratory\ninfectious disease caused by SARS coronavirus\n(SARS-CoV). The virus uses the spike (S) protein to\ninteract with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2, the\nhost cell receptor. Our approach is to design a\nworkflow with multiple bioinformatics tools in\nanalyzing the sequence of spike protein of the SARSCoV\nin searching its similarity to human proteins.\nFurthermore, eleven peptides have been synthesized to\nvalidate the in silico results.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Kuo-Yuan Hwa  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wan Man Lin", "ROC Yung-I Hou", "ROC Trai-Ming Yeh"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Molecular mimicry defined", "Sumber": "Frontiers in the Convergence of Bioscience and Information Technologies 2007", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Agu 2021"}
