However, logging interpretation such as facies classification and also reservoir characterization such as porosity and permeability interpretation are very labor work and time consuming if there are a lot of well that needed to be treated. Right now, application of machine learning are used in every area of expertise. This research wants to see if supervised machine learning can create a robust model to interpret facies, porosity, and permeability only from the selected well logging data as an input.\nMachine learning model starts with several well logs such as gamma ray log, Neutron log, density log, and resistivity log are used to create a model of multiclass classification of facies for each depth. Then after the most suitable data are selected, then the second stage which is porosity regression are executed. The 2 model between facies as additional feature and one that will not use facies will be compared. The data input used in this are gamma ray, density, resistivity log, sonic log, and photoelectric log. After that, the last stage, permeability regression model will be created with interpreted porosity used as additional data. Same with the porosity, permeability model will be compared between model that used facies as additional data and the other one will not use it.\nThe results of the facies prediction are pretty good with an accuracy of 88% for Well 9 and 92% for Well 10. And then for porosity regression, the model have a relatively small error with value of mean absolute error is 0.0153, mean squared error is 0.0005. While permeability regression with a mean absolute error of 10.554 and mean square error of 1229, still needed to be reeavaluate. Based on model comparison, facies log affects the model result but not significantly increases the result.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Dias Gabriel [12217091]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Dedy Irawan, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Facies prediction, Reservoir characterization, Machine learning", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Agu 2021"}
