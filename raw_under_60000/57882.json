{"Nomor": 57882, "Judul": "A REVIEW OF THE FORMATION OF COPPER NANOPARTICLES ASSISTED BY BIOLOGICAL AGENTS", "Abstrak": "Over the past few decades, one of the main focuses in materials science\ndevelopment is nanoparticles. The expansion and development of nanoscience and\nnanotechnology have stepped up by the desire of scientists to make a matter that\nhas several advantages in various areas of medicine, agriculture, and environmental\nremediation. The study of copper nanoparticles (both in metallic copper and copper\noxide) is economically attractive because copper is significantly more affordable\nthan silver and gold. Also, the utilization of copper nanoparticles can substitute gold\nand silver nanoparticles in several fields, namely antimicrobial agents, agriculture,\nwater treatment, potential energy storage, catalysts, and others. Recently, copper\nnanoparticles research is focused on the alternative fabrication process that\nconcerns sustainability and environmentally-friendly processes. Due to the several\nlimitations of conventional methods, the novelty, and eco-friendly concern, studies\nhave been shifted toward biological synthesis and its possibility to produce copper\nnanoparticles. Researchers have conducted several experiments using biological\nagents: brown algae, microalgae, fungi, bacteria biomass, and plant (leaves, roots,\nfruits, flowers, and seeds) extracts. This thesis highlights the alternative methods\n(biological synthesis) of copper nanoparticles, includes the factors that affected the\nnanoparticles\u2019 formation, the probable reduction mechanism, and their potential\napplications as antimicrobial (antifungal and antibacterial), and antiviral agents in\nthe future.\nThis thesis\u2019 writing process began by looking for related papers and books\ncontaining the following keywords: nanotechnology, nanoscience, copper\nnanoparticles, and biological synthesis. The data and information sources are\nlimited to the literature that only discusses the biological synthesis of copper\nnanoparticles. After that, the following process is reading, concluding literature\nsources, and writing the literature studies results.\nBased on the literature study, the probable reduction mechanism of copper\nnanoparticles using plant extracts starts from reducing precursors into copper\nnanoparticle clusters and nucleation of copper nanoparticles. Several biomolecules\nfrom plant extracts also play the role to encapsulate the copper nanoparticles to\nstabilize and avoid oxidation. The presence of natural surfactants from\nbiomolecules would help to avoid aggregation. Several factors affect the synthesis\nprocess of copper nanoparticles assisted by plant extracts: pH, precursor\nconcentration, reaction time, and operating temperature. Also, copper nanoparticles\nare effective to be antimicrobial (antifungal, and antibacterial), and antiviral agents\nagainst several pathogens such as E. coli, Salmonella sp., P. vulgaris, Streptococcus\nsp., Rhizobium sp., Klebsiella sp., L. monocytogenes, dengue vector A. aegypti and\navulavirus (Newcastle Virus Disease).", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Billy Akbar Prabowo": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/231500", "BAB 1 Billy Akbar Prabowo": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/231501", "BAB 2 Billy Akbar Prabowo": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/231502", "BAB 3 Billy Akbar Prabowo": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/231503", "BAB 4 Billy Akbar Prabowo": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/231504", "PUSTAKA Billy Akbar Prabowo": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/231505"}, "Penulis": "Billy Akbar Prabowo [22520306]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
