One of many uid-solid interactions\nphenomenon is vortex-induced vibration. In this undergraduate thesis, a numeri-\ncal simulation program, LSMPS-VPM, was developed to be able to simulate the\nvortex-induced vibration of a solid rigid object. LSMPS-VPM is a meshless com-\nputational uid dynamic program which utilized multi-resolution and LSMPS\nSpatial Operator for solving uid governing equation, Navier-Stokes equation.\nLSMPS-VPM uses the Brinkmann Penalization method to model the interaction\nbetween the uid ows and solid body in the simulation. The new LSMPS-VPM\nwas developed by adding a vortex-induced vibration solver which employed the\n4th order Runge-Kutta method. The program was tested with two benchmark\nproblems, namely uid ow through a static circular cylinder and vortex-induced\nvibration of a circular cylinder in a uid ows. The results of the selected test\ncases show that the developed program has been able to provide results which are\nin good agreement with the reference literatures, although some parameters still\ninherit large errors in computation.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Al-Faisal Firdaus": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/227654"}, "Penulis": "Al-Faisal Firdaus [13617016]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Lavi Rizki Zuhal"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Meshless Method, Development Method, LSMPS-VPM, Vortex-Induced Vibration, Brinkmann penalization", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Jun 2021"}
