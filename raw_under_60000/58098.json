{"Nomor": 58098, "Judul": "CHARACTERIZING THE HEARING COMFORT IN INTENSIVE CARE UNIT USING OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE EVALUATION", "Abstrak": "Hospital is a place that should be free of acoustic\nproblems. According to previous researches, these acoustic\nproblems are responsible for 20.9% - 26.2% of the ICU patient\u2019s\nrecovery process. A research based on soundscape of a hospital\nwas done through objective, subjective and simulation methods.\nThe result has shown that the most perceived loud sound is from\nthe ventilator at 4000 Hz with loudness level of 60 phon. The L90\nscore is between 55-59 dBA. The Leq ranged between 50.78-67.49\ndBA at the left ear and 60.07-76.55 at the right ear from the first\nreceiver position. From the second measuring point, L10 score is\naround 52.08-72.19 dBA at the left ear and 61.91-78.94 at the right\near. This value indicates that the noise level in the ICU is high\nenough, and caused discomfort for human hearing. Installation of\npanels on ceiling at the nurse ward can reduce the intensity level\nup to 3 dBA. Meanwhile, relocation of nurse ward can reduce up\nto 4 dBA.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Joko Sarwono [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ezra Tandian, Andika Rizki ,Sentagi Utami and Ressy Yanti"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Hospital, ICU, soundscape, noise", "Sumber": "2015 4th International Conference on Instrumentation, Communications, Information Technology, and Biomedical Engineering (ICICI-BME) Bandung, November 2-3, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Agu 2021"}
