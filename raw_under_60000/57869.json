{"Nomor": 57869, "Judul": "PRODUCTION PREDICTION DURING WATERFLOOD USING CAPACITANCE MODEL", "Abstrak": "Waterflooding is one of method that used to increase reservoir recovery in oil and gas industry. In this era, an advance \u2013 efficiently and economically \u2013 reservoir characterization should be done. To do so, Capacitance Model (CM) can be used to quantify communication between wells in a reservoir. CM only requires production and injection history, which are the most abundant data gathered throughout the production life of reservoir. Furthermore, this model can be used to field in which wells are shut in frequently or for long periods time, the rates have a remnant of primary production, and has the capability to incorporate bottomhole-pressure (BHP) data if available. The performance of two representations are analyzed: single tank (CMT) and producer based (CMP). CMT will be used to monitor the impact of the waterflooding for the entire field and the CMP will be used to allocating the water for each injector well.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Agatha Chrisantya Permatasari": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/231481"}, "Penulis": "Agatha Chrisantya Permatasari [12217037]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ardhi Hakim Lumban Gaol, S.T., M.T., M.Si., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Waterflood, Capacitance Model, Secondary Recovery", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Agu 2021"}
