The gravity method is a geophysical method that is often used to study the subsurface structures. This method can detect differences in the density distribution of subsurface rocks. The objectives to be achieved in this study are to obtain information on the distribution pattern of the Bouguer anomaly area 'X', determine the subsurface structure of the 'X' area based on the gravity method through two-dimensional gravity modeling, analyze and interpret the subsurface structure of the 'X' area based on the density distribution. This research area has a range of complete bouguer anomaly values varying from 7.9 mGal to 15.8 mGal. The separation of regional and residual anomalies is executed using the moving average method. From the results of the residual anomaly map, the anomaly value ranges from -0.641 mGal to 0.709 mGal. Residual anomaly maps show more complex patterns than regional anomalies because residual anomalies provide a lateral representation of rock mass distribution or the presence of subsurface geological structures that are relatively close to the earth's surface. From the 2D modeling results obtained 4 subsurface composing rock layers with the graben in the first and second layers. The first layer which is located at the top has different rock types with a density of 2.25 gr/ cm3 and 2.45 gr/ cm3 which are indicated as sandstone and shale. In the second layer there is rhyolite with a density of 2.6 gr / cm3. In the third layer there is andesite with a density of 2.7 gr/ cm3. While the fourth layer is located at the deepest, it is suspected that there is granite rock with a density of 2.8 gr/ cm3.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Winda Umara Haq": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/223231", "PUSTAKA Winda Umara Haq": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/223423"}, "Penulis": "Winda Umara Haq [10216093]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Wahyu Srigutomo, S.Si., M.Si., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Bouguer Anomaly, Geothermal, Gravity Method, Forward Modeling, Subsurface Structure", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "8 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Mar 2021"}
