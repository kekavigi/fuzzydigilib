{"Nomor": 54301, "Judul": "PERANCANGAN FONDASI BATUAN DAN GROUTING BENDUNGAN UTAMA BENDUNGAN ASAHAN IV, KABUPATEN ASAHAN, PROVINSI SUMATERA UTAR", "Abstrak": "Asahan IV Dam was built to raise the water level of the Asahan River to create a\nhigh water fall that can meet the electricity needs of the Asahan IV Hydro Power\nPlant (PLTA). This final project aims to design a rock foundation system that can\nmaintain structural stability and reduce seepage discharge in the main dam. This\ndesign takes into account seven load combinations divided into three categories:\nordinary, extraordinary and extreme. After obtaining the design results from the\nhydrological and hydraulics and structural design fields, further analysis of\nsubsidence and seepage analysis was carried out in the main dam with PLAXIS 2D\nto obtain a feasibility assessment in the field of geotechnical design. The settlement\nanalysis consists of identifying the decline in the permit, examining the maximum\nsettlement and examining the effect of differential subsidence on the dam system. It\nwas found that the design met the criteria and was considered safe against the\ndecline that occurred. Meanwhile, for seepage analysis, the total head, pressure\nhead, and hydraulic gradient were examined. The values obtained were not in\naccordance with the permit requirements, so that grouting was designed at the\ndepths of the upstream and downstream edges of the dam.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Naufal Fathin Ar Rasyid": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/222479", "COVER Naufal Fathin Ar Rasyid": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/260787", "PUSTAKA Naufal Fathin Ar Rasyid": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/260797"}, "Penulis": "Naufal Fathin Ar Rasyid [15016077]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
