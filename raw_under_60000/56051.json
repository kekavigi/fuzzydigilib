{"Nomor": 56051, "Judul": "OPTIMIZATION ON STEAM FLOODING PROJECT USING INJECTION STRATEGY WITH INVERTED FIVE-SPOT INJECTION PATTERN", "Abstrak": "This study describes the determination of injection strategy with a 5-spot injection pattern optimally by performing\nintermittent steam flood injection to optimize Profitability Index (PI) and Steam Oil Ratio (SOR) through\nsensitivity study of several synthetic simulation cases. Steam flood is one of the EOR methods used to facilitate\nthe removal of heavy oil by injecting steam into the reservoir. Steam injection optimization is closely related to\ntemperature, steam quality, and injection model. Using the CMG STARS software, a synthetic field model of the\nsteam flood project was created. Economic analysis plays an important role in determining the feasibility of\napplying this method.\nThis study focuses on the results of the Recovery Factor (RF), Steam Oil Ratio, and Profitability Index in each\ncase and determines the case that can produce the most optimum yield for 25 years of producing wells, starting\nfrom 2021 to 2046. Cases are determined from variations in time intervals when applying the method. intermittent.\nThe intermittent method consists of \"on mode\" and \"off mode\". This is done to reduce the value of the Steam Oil\nRatio and reduce operational costs. Thus, the intermittent method is the optimum method from an economic point\nof view.\nThe reservoir model was built based on mostly Duri Field reservoir data. Other required data was collected from\nliterature. A continuous steam flood injection scenario was set as the base case model. The simulation of the base\ncase resulted in the RF, SOR, and PI of 21.32%, 2.08, and 1.604 respectively. Finding the optimal PI with\ndetermining the optimal time for the intermittent injection method to be applied by taking one case. From the\nsimulation, it was found that the largest PI occurred when the intermittent injection method was applied in 2041.\nAfter obtaining the optimum starting time for intermittent heating or cooling, it is continued by simulating several\nother cases. The simulation results show that SOR and RF values between continuous steam flood (before\noptimization) and steam flood after optimization with intermittent injection are different. The Steam Flood that is\ninjected intermittently for 2 weeks produces a slightly lower oil recovery factor and lower steam oil ratio.\nHowever, they have a higher profitability index than the continuous steam flood, which are 20.739%, 2.0, and\n1.635 respectively.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Shofi Kirana": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/227493"}, "Penulis": "Shofi Kirana [12217005]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zuher Syihab, S.T., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Steam flood, Intermittent, EOR, profitability index (PI)", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Jun 2021"}
