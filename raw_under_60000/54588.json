In particular, priors can be useful in\ncaseswhere images are corrupted and contain artefacts due\nto limitations in image acquisition. The highly constrained\nnature of anatomical objects can be well captured with\nlearning-based techniques. However, in most recent and\npromising techniques such as CNN-based segmentation\nit is not obvious how to incorporate such prior knowledge.\nState-of-the-art methods operate as pixel-wise classifiers\nwhere the training objectives do not incorporate the\nstructure and inter-dependencies of the output. To overcome\nthis limitation, we propose a generic training strategy\nthat incorporates anatomical prior knowledge into CNNs\nthrough a new regularisation model, which is trained endto-\nend. The new framework encourages models to follow\nthe global anatomical properties of the underlying anatomy\n(e.g. shape, label structure) via learnt non-linear representations\nof the shape. We show that the proposed approach\ncan be easily adapted to different analysis tasks (e.g. image\nenhancement, segmentation) and improve the prediction\naccuracy of the state-of-the-art models. The applicability of\nour approachis shown onmulti-modal cardiac data sets and\npublic benchmarks. In addition, we demonstrate how the\nlearnt deep models of 3-D shapes can be interpreted and\nused as biomarkers for classificationof cardiac pathologies.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ozan Oktay [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Enzo Ferrante, Konstantinos Kamnitsas, Mattias Heinrich, Wenjia Bai, Jose Caballero , Stuart A.
