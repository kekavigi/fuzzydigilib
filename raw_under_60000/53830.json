This\ncondition makes them unable to have freezers to store fish or ice makers to make\nice on board. Therefore, they usually bring ice to store fish. Due to the high use of\nice after harvesting fish, ice becomes a significant expense in their profession. Ice\nis not reusable, since it\u2019s thrown away after it melts into water. More ice is added\nafter some or all of the ices melt, which therefore increases their expenses.\nAn alternative solution for fish cold storage by using Phase Change Material (PCM)\nis proposed in this research. Phase change material, if contained properly, is\nreusable. Eutectic potassium chloride (KCl) solution is used as PCM, which has the\nmixture of 19.5% (wt.%) KCl. This PCM melts at ?10.7 \u00b0C, which is suitable to be\nused as cold storage medium, and has high heat of fusion of 253 kJ/kg. The eutectic\nKCl solution is contained in an aluminium-foil zip-lock bags as the containment to\nkeep it from leakages and prevent it from contamination with fish. Each pouch\ncontains 670 grams of PCM. Two Polystyrene boxes, each with 53 L of volume,\nare used as a simulation of fish cool box used by fishermen or fish collectors. These\nboxes contain different cold storage medium to store fish, which can be the eutectic\nsolution or ice with two configurations: ice contained inside the same pouches used\nfor KCl solution, and ice cubes (or ice flakes). Organoleptic test is also performed\nto measure fish quality.\nThe result shows that cool box equipped with the PCM pouches has steady\ntemperature of around 0 to 3 \u00b0C, which holds for 18 to 24 hours, depends on the\nindoor or outdoor placement of the box. The PCM itself has steady temperature of\naround ?11 \u00b0C, which is around the theoretical phase-change temperature.\nMoreover, the overall fish quality stored inside the PCM box is kept fresh better\nthan the ones stored inside box filled with either ice inside pouches or ice cubes.\nAlthough the difference is not huge for 24 hours of storage, for longer fish storage\n(2 to 3 days) the fish quality could be significantly different.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK ROBERTUS KRISTIANTO SUKOCO": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/221573"}, "Penulis": "ROBERTUS KRISTIANTO SUKOCO [23118023]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Yuli Setyo Indartono", "Dr. rer. nat.
