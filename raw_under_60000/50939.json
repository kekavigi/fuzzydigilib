{"Nomor": 50939, "Judul": "DYNAMIC RESPONSE ANALYSIS OF AIRCRAFT WITH ACTUATION SYSTEM FAILURE: OPEN-LOOP AND CLOSED-LOOP CASES", "Abstrak": "On flight control implementation, the control surface actuator system plays one of the\nkey roles that will significantly affect the closed-loop performance of the aircraft. The\nactuators must provide the required effort for moving the control surface so that the\ndesired control action can be reached. Any failure on the actuator system will limit or\ndegrade the operation of the control surface, so that it will affect the performance of\nthe system in controlling the aircraft, or even worse, may bring the aircraft into an\nunsafe condition. In this project, the effect of some control surface problem due to\nactuator failures are modeled, simulated, and analyzed. To reconstruct the situation, the\ncontrol device failure model is integrated into the flight dynamic model of an aircraft.\nThe numerical model of the equation then is used for simulating the aircraft response\nunder some failure condition. It can be seen from the simulation results that control\nsurface failure can significantly affect the trim condition of the aircraft, since the\nfailures can change the balance of forces and moments that work on the aircraft. The\nsimulation results also show that for some control surface failures they may initiate an\nasymmetrical response from the aircraft dynamics. On closed-loop simulations, where\nsome type of flight control systems for stabilization and maneuvering tasks are\nimplemented, control surface failures may affect the performance of the control system.\nThe results of the study suggest that any possibilities of control surface failure must be\nanticipated, by using a robust control scheme or other reconfigurable schemes that can\ncope with the change in the dynamic characteristics due to the failures.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK M Fadhil Dzaki Syamsul": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/213753"}, "Penulis": "M Fadhil Dzaki Syamsul [13616021]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Rianto Adhy Sasongko, S.T., M.Sc., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "actuation system failure, dynamic response, stability, control, flight control system", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Sep 2020"}
