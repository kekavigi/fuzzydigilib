{"Nomor": 53168, "Judul": "SPATIAL ANGULAR COMPOUNDING OF PHOTOACOUSTIC IMAGES", "Abstrak": "Photoacoustic (PA) images utilize pulsed lasers and\nultrasound transducers to visualize targets with higher optical\nabsorption than the surrounding medium. However, they are\nsusceptible to acoustic clutter and background noise artifacts\nthat obfuscate biomedical structures of interest. We investigated\nthree spatial-angular compounding methods to improve PA image\nquality for biomedical applications, implemented by combining\nmultiple images acquired as an ultrasound probe was rotated\nabout the elevational axis with the laser beam and target fixed.\nCompounding with conventional averaging was based on the pose\ninformation of each PA image, while compounding with weighted\nand selective averaging utilized both the pose and image content\ninformation. Weighted-average compounding enhanced PA images\nwith the least distortion of signal size, particularly when there\nwere large (i.e., 2.5 mm and 7 ) perturbations from the initial\nprobe position. Selective-average compounding offered the best\nimprovement in image quality with up 181, 1665, and 1568 times\nhigher contrast, CNR, and SNR, respectively, compared to the\nmean values of individual PA images. The three presented spatial\ncompounding methods have promising potential to enhance image\nquality in multiple photoacoustic applications.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hyun Jae Kang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Muyinatu A Lediju Bell, Xiaoyu Guo, and Emad M.
