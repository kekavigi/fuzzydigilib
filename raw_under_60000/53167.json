{"Nomor": 53167, "Judul": "EFFECTIVE FIVE DIRECTIONAL PARTIAL DERIVATIVES-BASED IMAGE SMOOTHING AND A PARALLEL STRUCTURE DESIGN", "Abstrak": "Image smoothing has been used for image segmentation,\nimage reconstruction, object classification, and 3D content\ngeneration. Several smoothing approaches have been used at the\npre-processing step to retain the critical edge, while removing\nnoise and small details. However, they have limited performance,\nespecially in removing small details and smoothing discrete\nregions. Therefore, to provide fast and accurate smoothing, we\npropose an effective scheme that uses a weighted combination of\nthe gradient, Laplacian, and diagonal derivatives of a smoothed\nimage. In addition, to reduce computational complexity, we\ndesigned and implemented a parallel processing structure for the\nproposed scheme on a graphics processing unit (GPU). For an\nobjective evaluation of the smoothing performance, the images\nwere linearly quantized into several layers to generate experimental\nimages, and the quantized images were smoothed using\nseveral methods for reconstructing the smoothly changed shape\nand intensity of the original image. Experimental results showed\nthat the proposed scheme has higher objective scores and better\nsuccessful smoothing performance than similar schemes, while\npreserving and removing critical and trivial details, respectively.\nFor computational complexity, the proposed smoothing scheme\nrunning on a GPU provided 18 and 16 times lower complexity\nthan the proposed smoothing scheme running on a CPU and the\nL0-based smoothing scheme, respectively. In addition, a simple\nnoise reduction test was conducted to show the characteristics of\nthe proposed approach; it reported that the presented algorithm\noutperforms the state-of-the art algorithms by more than 5.4 dB.\nTherefore, we believe that the proposed scheme can be a useful\ntool for efficient image smoothing.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Choongsang Cho [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sangkeun Lee"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Image smoothing, Laplacian, parallel processing, low-complexity.", "Sumber": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Mar 2021"}
