{"Nomor": 33418, "Judul": "Experimental investigation of predicting coal failure using acoustic emission energy and load-unload response ratio theory", "Abstrak": "Coal burst is a dynamic failure phenomenon that is caused by a sudden release of strain energy during mining. It\nis extremely difficult to predict coal burst accurately. In this study, experimental tests were performed under uniaxial cyclic load-unload conditions using a microcomputer-controlled electrohydraulic servo stiffness compressor with acoustic emission (AE) monitoring. The experiments data, such as the AE energy, AE energy ratio and\nload-unload energy response ratio, were obtained. The Y value of the load-unload response ratio (LURR) was calculated based on these data. The results show that variation characteristics of the AE energy release can be related\nto the failure of coal specimens. The concentrated release of AE energy occurs at the beginning of the plastic deformation stage. Then, AE energy was accumulated before coal specimens' failure. The variation characteristics of\nthe LURR (Y1) and Benioff strain (Y2) were obtained. The fluctuation of Y1 and Y2 values was exhibited to coincide\nwith the AE energy accumulation, which allowed predicting coal failures. The predicting time point where the Y1\nand Y2 values were both close to 1 could be defined as the predicting key point of coal specimens' failure. These\nresults of experimental investigation show a meaningful attempt for predicting coal failure.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Chunlai Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiaolin Hou, Zefeng Liao, Zeng Chen, Zhijiang Lu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Coal failure Uniaxial cyclic load-unload test AE energy Load-unload response ratio Prediction", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 161 (2019) 76\u201383, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.12.010", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Jan 2019"}
