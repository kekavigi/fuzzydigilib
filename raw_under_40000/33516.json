{"Nomor": 33516, "Judul": "Defeating SQL injection attack in authentication security: an experimental study", "Abstrak": "Whenever web-application executes dynamic\nSQL statements it may come under SQL injection attack.\nTo evaluate the existing practices of its detection, we con-\nsider two different security scenarios for the\nweb-application\nauthentication that generates dynamic SQL query with the\nuser input data. Accordingly, we generate two different\ndatasets by considering all possible vulnerabilities in the\nrun-time queries. We present proposed approach based on\nedit-distance\nto classify a dynamic SQL query as\nnormal\nor\nmalicious\nusing web-profile prepared with the dynamic SQL\nqueries during training phase. We evaluate the dataset using\nproposed approach and some well-known supervised clas-\nsification approaches. Our proposed method is found more\neffective in detecting SQL injection attack under both the\nscenarios of authentication security.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "undefined [2017]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Utpal Sharma.", "D.
