{"Nomor": 34963, "Judul": "Statistical regression modeling for energy consumption in wastewater treatment", "Abstrak": "Wastewater treatment is one of critical issues faced by water utilities, and receives more and\nmore attentions recently. The energy consumption modeling in biochemical wastewater\ntreatment was investigated in the study via a general and robust approach based on\nBayesian semi-parametric quantile regression. The dataset was derived from a municipal\nwastewater treatment plant, where the energy consumption of unit chemical oxygen\ndemand (COD) reduction was the response variable of interest. Via the proposed approach,\nthe comprehensive regression pictures of the energy consumption and truly influencing\nfactors, i.e., the regression relationships at lower, median and higher energy consumption\nlevels were characterized respectively. Meanwhile, the proposals for energy saving in\ndifferent cases were also facilitated specifically. First, the lower level of energy consumption\nwas closely associated with the temperature of influent wastewater, and the chroma-rich\nwastewater also showed helpful in the execution of energy saving. Second, at median energy\nconsumption level, the COD-rich wastewater played a determinative role in the reduction\nof energy consumption, while the higher quality of treated water led to slightly energy\nintensive. Third, the higher level of energy consumption was most likely to be attributed\nto the relatively high temperature of wastewater and total nitrogen (TN)-rich wastewater,\nand both of the factors were preferably to be avoided to alleviate the burden of energy\nconsumption. The study provided an efficient approach to controlling the energy consumption of wastewater treatment in the perspective of statistical regression modeling, and offered\nvaluable suggestions for the future energy saving.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yang Yu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zhihong Zou.,Shanshan Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Energy consumption modeling Wastewater treatment Semi-parametric model Bayesian quantile regression", "Sumber": "JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES 75 (2019) 201 \u2013 208", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Feb 2019"}
