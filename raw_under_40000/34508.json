Matching diversified customer needs with a company\u2019s product offerings has been a challenge for academia and industry. To this end, product \nconfigurator systems have been accepted as important tools to elicit customer needs to meet the challenge. However for complex products with many product possibilities and intricate inter-product relationships, current product configuration systems may become tedious and time consuming for customers\u2019choice navigation process. They cannot adapt to each individual customer\u2019s preferences by\nleveraging on the attribute specification information captured in previous configuration steps. This paper presents a Gini index-based attribute selection approach for configurator design. Product \nconfiguring is modelled as a sequential query\u2013answer process. In each configuring step, the Gini index is deployed to quantify the clarity of the designer\u2019s beliefsabout the customer\u2019s needs. The attribute which contributes most to the clarity will be selected for the customer to configure. A product recommendation module is also integrated with the configurator to further improve the efficiency. \nAs a result, designers obtain clarification on the customer\u2019s needs and preferences in an accelerated manner. An example is presented to test the viability of the method", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yue Wang  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mitchell Tseng"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "user-centred design; customisation; choice navigation; product con fi gurator; Gini index", "Sumber": "International Journal of Production Research , 2014 Vol. 52, No. 20, 6136 \u2013 6145", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Feb 2019"}
