{"Nomor": 37770, "Judul": "Stress wave propagation and dynamic behavior of red sandstone with single bonded planar joint at various angles", "Abstrak": "Dynamic impact tests were carried out on red sandstone specimens with single bonded planar joint at various\nangles based on a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB), to investigate the stress wave propagation and fracturing\nevolution of the specimens comprising two blocks. The results indicate that the bonded joint will reduce the\ndynamic strength from 3.10% to 32.13% compared with the intact specimen. The larger the joint angle is, the\nmore significant the wave attenuation is. The variation trend of energy absorption rate is similar to the tendency\nof the dynamic strength, showing a positive correlation between the energy absorption rate and the dynamic\nstrength. Tensile cracks dominate the specimen failure behavior during the dynamic fracturing process by observing the images captured by a high speed camera, leading to the slabbing failure with different degrees of\nslippage along the joint surface. In addition, it is found that the variation tendency of dynamic strength based on\nthe experimental results is consistent with the theoretical analysis.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Diyuan Li [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zhenyu Han, Quanqi Zhu , Yan Zhang , P.G.
