{"Nomor": 38155, "Judul": "Influence of Reynolds number on the motion of settling, bidisperse inertial particles in turbulence", "Abstrak": "Using direct numerical simulations, we examine the effects of the Taylor Reynolds\nnumber, R? ? u\n?/? (where u, ?, and ? denote the fluid root-mean-squared velocity, the\nTaylor microscale and the fluid kinematic viscosity, respectively), and Froude number,\nFr ? a?/g (where a? is the Kolmogorov acceleration, and g is the acceleration due to\ngravity), on the motion of small, spherical, settling, bidisperse inertial particles (characterized\nby their Stokes number St ? ?p/??, which is the ratio of the particle response\ntime to the Kolmogorov timescale) in isotropic turbulence. Particle accelerations play\na key role in the relative motion of bidisperse particles, and we find that reducing Fr\nleads to an enhancement of the accelerations but a suppression of their intermittency. For\nStokes numbers St > 1, the effect of R? on the accelerations is enhanced by gravity, since\nsettling causes the particle accelerations to be affected by a larger range of flow scales.\nThe results for the probability density function (PDF) of the particle relative velocities\nshow that even when the particles are settling very fast, turbulence continues to play a\nkey role in their vertical relative velocities, and increasingly so as R? is increased. This\noccurs because although the settling velocity may be much larger than typical velocities\nof the turbulence, due to intermittency, there are significant regions of the flow where the\nturbulence contribution to the particle motion is of the same order as that from gravitational\nsettling. Increasing R? enhances the non-Gaussianity of the relative velocity PDFs, while\nreducing Fr has the opposite effect, and for fast settling particles, the PDFs become\napproximately Gaussian. Finally, we observe that low-order statistics such as the radial\ndistribution function and the particle collision kernel are strongly affected by Fr and St,\nand especially by the degree of bidispersity of the particles. However, we also find that\nthese low-order statistics are very weakly affected by R? when St  O(1), irrespective of\nthe degree of bidispersity. Therefore, although the mechanisms controlling the collision\nrates of monodisperse and bidisperse particles are different, they share the property of a\nweak sensitivity to R? when St  O(1).", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mohammadreza Momenifar [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Rohit Dhariwal,", "and Andrew D.
