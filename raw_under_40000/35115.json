{"Nomor": 35115, "Judul": "Functional genera, potential pathogens and predicted antibiotic resistance genes in 16 full-scale wastewater treatment plants treating different types of wastewater", "Abstrak": "This study aimed to investigate the bacterial communities and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in 16 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) treating municipal, industrial and mixed wastewater. Wastewater types showed\nobvious effects on bacterial communities and functions. Nitrosomonas, Nitrospira, Hyphomicrobium and\nAccumulibacter were the main functional genera. Mycobacterium was the dominant potential pathogens. A total of\n69 ARGs were obtained, and the dominant ARGs subtypes were similar in different WWTPs. Efflux pumps were\nthe most common resistance mechanisms. Copper and zinc resistance genes were the main metal resistance genes\n(MRGs). Wastewater types affected the distributions of ARGs and MRGs, and they were more similar in industrial\nand mixed wastewater. The co-occurrence of ARGs existed within or across ARG types, and they were also\npositively linked to MRGs, some functional and pathogenic genera or environmental factors. This study furthers\nthe understanding of interactions between bacterial communities, ARGs and MRGs in different WWTPs.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xiao-Yan Fan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jing-Feng Gao., Kai-Ling Pan.,, Ding-Chang Li.,Hui-Hui Dai.,Xing Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Bacterial community composition Functional genera Potential pathogens Antibiotic resistance genes Metal resistance genes Wastewater types", "Sumber": "Bioresource Technology 268 (2018) 97\u2013106", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Feb 2019"}
