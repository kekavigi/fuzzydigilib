{"Nomor": 38153, "Judul": "Characteristics of mean flow and turbulence in bubble-in-chain induced flows", "Abstrak": "This paper presents the experimental results from an air bubble-in-chain induced flow\nat different bubble release frequencies, resulting in a range of 1510\u20132318 for the Reynolds\nnumber based on bubble parameters. Mean flow and turbulent statistics were measured\nusing planar particle image velocimetry. The bubble rise velocities were validated to be the\nsuperposition of the mean vertical velocity of water and the terminal velocity of the isolated\nbubbles. We tested the scaling parameters for the bubble-in-chain induced flow using\nthose typically for bubble plumes, which demonstrates the intrinsic similarities of these\ntwo bubbly flows. We found that the radial profiles of normalized mean vertical velocity\nfor bubble-in-chain induced flows and bubble plumes collapse well using the center-line\nvelocity and the half-width of the velocity profile.We found the half-width correlated with\nthe characteristic length scales of the bubble wakes. The normalized Reynolds stresses\nusing the local velocity square show the same shape of profiles for both bubbly flows,\nbut they do not collapse onto universal curves. The normalized turbulent kinetic energy is\na function of normalized gas flow rate and approaches an asymptotic value of 0.05. The\ndynamic length scale, a function of initial kinematic buoyancy flux, was found to govern\nturbulent dissipation rates in both bubbly flows. The normalized one-dimensional velocity\nenergy spectra collapse in the regime of kv? > 0.1 where kv is the wave number and ? is\nthe Kolmogorov length scale, showing a ?3 slope as the result of energy balance between\nproduction from bubble motion and dissipation in the bubble wakes. The wake length scale\nwas found to define the lower-end wave number of the ?3 slope.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Binbin Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Scott A.
