{"Nomor": 32496, "Judul": "Games without frontiers: On the moral and psychological implications of violating taboos within multi-player virtual spaces", "Abstrak": "When assessing the appropriateness of massively multiplayer online role-playing games, it is our contention\nthat questions dealing with the morality of their content \u2013 especially regarding the more \u2018adult\u2019 nature\nof potential interactions \u2013 are the wrong sorts of questions to ask. Instead, when considering the\npermissibility of such games, a more informative strategy is to focus on what gamers are able to deal\nwith, psychologically, especially regarding taboo violation. Thus, we argue that there is nothing morally\nproblematic with online gamespace per se, no matter how prohibitive the simulated behaviour is offline\n(as long as the space is frequented by adults only). Instead, we should concern ourselves with whether\nthe potential moral freedoms afforded the online gaming community are psychologically healthy: For\nit is our contention that underlying any change to the gamer\u2019s behaviour offline is the need (in some)\nto seek psychological parity across domains (making congruent one\u2019s identity and actions in both the virtual\nand offline worlds). It is therefore not so much what games are doing to us that is of concern, here,\nbut what we are doing to ourselves through the process of seeking psychological parity.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Garry Young [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Monica T.
