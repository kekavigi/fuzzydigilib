{"Nomor": 37582, "Judul": "A PIECEWISE LINEARMODEL FOR ANALYZING THIN FILM/SUBSTRATE STRUCTURE IN FLEXIBLE ELECTRONICS", "Abstrak": "The conventional analytical method of predicting strain in a thin film under bending\nis restricted to the uniform material assumption, while in flexible electronics, the film/substrate\nstructure is widely used with mismatched material properties taken into account. In this paper,\na piecewise model is proposed to analyze the axial strain in a thin film of flexible electronics with\nthe shear modification factor and principle of virtual work. The excellent agreement between\nanalytical prediction and finite element results indicates that the model is capable of predicting\nthe strain of the film/substrate structure in flexible electronics, whose mechanical stability and\nelectrical performance is dependent on the strain state in the thin film.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xianhong Meng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ming Li, Yilin Xing, Haijun Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "piecewise linear model, flexible electronics, film/substrate, mismatched material properties, strain distribution", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Apr 2019"}
