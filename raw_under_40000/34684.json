{"Nomor": 34684, "Judul": "Laboratory Experiments Of Well Testing For Fracture-Cave Carbonate Gas Reservoirs", "Abstrak": "It is well known that the flowing of oil and gas in fracture and cave does not obey Darcy law, which\nmakes it unable to interpret parameters correctly when doing well testing for those kinds of formation for having no flowing test used to correct corresponding flowing equations. Based on\nsimilarity criterion, a physical experimental method for gas flowing from cave to wellbore through\nfracture has been built up. The characteristics of fluid flowing in fracture and cave can be seen\nclearly according to logelog curves with the measured data, which was obtained from the experimental model test and dealt with Savitzky-Golay filtering method. In addition, a new mathematical model reflecting those transient-flow behaviors as well as its solution has been presented\nin this paper. Logelog curves obtained from our new model could reflect the characteristics of\nflowing in fracture and cave. The results showed that test experiments can reflect the influence of\nlarge-scaled cave and fracture on the flowing characteristics and the new model can be applied to\nexplain parameters of fracture and cave for similar cases", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yu Xiong [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wanli Xiong", "Mingjin Cai b , Chengxi Hou", "Chong Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Fractured-cave reservoir, Well testing, Mathematical model, Similarity criterion", "Sumber": "Petroleum, Volume 3, Issue 3, 301-308 (September 2017)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Feb 2019"}
