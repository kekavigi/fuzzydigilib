{"Nomor": 34224, "Judul": "The UK National Arts Education Archive: Ideas and Imaginings", "Abstrak": "The National Arts Education Archive (NAEA) is housed and maintained by the Yorkshire Sculpture\nPark (YSP), and managed by YSP coordinators and educators with a well-established volunteer pro-\ngramme. This year, 2017, as part of the celebrations of the YSP\u2019s 40th anniversary, the Archive will\nhold its own exhibition entitledTreasures   Revealed: a collection of items selected by people who\nhave been involved in the Archive, whether as donors, volunteers, researchers, artists, trustees or\nsteering group members. In parallel with the exhibition, this article aims to give voice to a selec-\ntion of individuals and groups associated with the Archive, discussing their interests and experi-\nences of it, and their thoughts on its value and importance as a repository of arts education\nmaterials, ideals and practices. Our primary motivations were to consider these different voices in\nrelation to the purpose, direction and relevance of the NAEA today. These exchanges raise funda-\nmental questions and debates about what art education is and what it might become, and how\nthese historical collections, and creative engagements with it, might help to shape our contempo-\nrary thinking.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jeff Adams [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Rowan Bailey and Neil Walton"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "digital networks, education values, historiography, archives, art education", "Sumber": "THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION, 2017", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Feb 2019"}
