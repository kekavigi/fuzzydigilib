{"Nomor": 32860, "Judul": "Living walls in indoor environments", "Abstrak": "The warming climate, projected increase in frequency and severity of extreme heat events, and the long-established heat island phenomenon are all expected to exacerbate urban environmental thermal loading. Active\nmeans used for addressing such risks are likely to increase energy consumption and emission trends to create a\npositive feedback loop that could threaten the health and wellbeing of urban citizens. In response, passive\napproaches such as green infrastructure enhancements are widely advocated, and to meet the challenges of\nimplementing enhancements in dense cities, attention has been directed toward encouraging surface greening.\nThis paper recognises this trend and considers vertical greening as a developing interest with application opportunity in both exterior and interior urban environments. A review of available studies and interviews with\nexperts found most observations available to be derived from exterior applications. Interior applications consequently have yet to be investigated to determine relative value to indoor environments where most of human\nhabitation is typically concentrated. The integration of plant science studies in this regard is highlighted as\nessential to develop a balanced evidence base for the enthusiasm observed for promoting indoor living wall\ninstallations.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Kanchane Gunawardena [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": [", Koen Steemers"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Urban greening Vertical greening Living walls Indoor plants Indoor envir onment", "Sumber": "Building and Environment 148 (2019) 478\u2013487", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Jan 2019"}
