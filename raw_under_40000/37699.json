{"Nomor": 37699, "Judul": "Generating cancellable fingerprint templates based on Delaunay triangle feature set construction", "Abstrak": "In this study, the authors propose a novel fingerprint template protection scheme that is developed using\nDelaunay triangulation net constructed from the fingerprint minutiae. The authors propose two methods namely FS_INCIR and FS_AVGLO to construct a feature set from the Delaunay triangles. The feature set computed is quantised and mapped to a 3D array to produce fixed length 1D bit string. This bit string is applied with a DFT to generate a complex vector. Finally, the complex vector is multiplied by user\u2019s key to generate a cancellable template. The proposed computation of feature set maintained a good balance between security and performance. These methods are tested on FVC 2002 and FVC 2004 databases and the experimental results show satisfactory performance. Further, the authors analysed the four requirements namely diversity, revocability, irreversibility and accuracy for protecting biometric templates. Thus, the feasibility of proposed scheme is depicted.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mulagala Sandhya [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Munaga V.N.K.
