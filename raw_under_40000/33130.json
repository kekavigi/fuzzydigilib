{"Nomor": 33130, "Judul": "A Hybrid Pso-Svm-Based Model For Determination Of Oil Recovery Factor In The Low-Permeability Reservoir", "Abstrak": "Oil recovery factor is one of the most important parameters in the development process of oil\nreservoir, especially in the low-permeability reservoir. In general, the determination of recovery\nfactor can be obtained either experimentally or numerically. Experimental method is often timeconsuming and expensive, while numerical method has been always confined to narrow range\nof application or relatively large error. Recently, an intelligent method has been proven as an\nefficient tool to model the complex and nonlinear phenomena. In this work, an intelligent model\nbased on support vector machine in combination with the particle swarm optimization (PSO-SVM)\ntechnique was established to predict oil recovery factor in the low-permeability reservoir. Input\nvariables of the proposed PSO-SVM model with the aid of a grey correlation analysis method are\npermeability, well spacing density, production-injection well ratio, porosity, effective thickness,\ncrude oil viscosity and output parameter is oil recovery factor of low-permeability reservoir. The\naccuracy and reliability of the proposed model were evaluated through 34 data sets collected in the\nopen literature and compared with PSO-BP neural network, empirical method from Oil and Gas\nCompany. The results indicated that the PSO-SVM model gives the best results with average absolute relative deviation (AARD) of 3.79%, while AARDs for the PSO-BP neural network and\nempirical method are 9.18% and 10.0%, respectively. Furthermore, outlier detection was used on the\nbasis of whole data sets to definite the valid domains of PSO-SVM and PSO-BP models by detecting\nthe probable doubtful recovery factor data in the low-permeability reservoir", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "BING HAN [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiaoqiang Bian"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "PSO-SVM, Recovery factor, Low permeability, Reservoir Outlier detection", "Sumber": "Petroleum 4 (2018) 43-49 - KeAi, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2017.06.001", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Jan 2019"}
