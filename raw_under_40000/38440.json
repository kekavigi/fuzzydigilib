{"Nomor": 38440, "Judul": "Photodegradation of Methyl Orange under Visible Light by Micro-Nano Hierarchical Cu2O Structure Fabricated by Hybrid Laser Processing and Chemical Dealloying", "Abstrak": "Micro-nano hierarchical structure on the substrate\nwas fabricated by a hybrid approach including laser deposition,\nlaser ablation and chemical dealloying. The structure consists of\nmicro bumps with a width of 50 ?m and a height of 100 ?m, and\nnanoporous structures with a size of 70150 nm on the micro\nbumps. XRD and XPS results confirm that these hierarchical structures were made of Cu2O. For use in comparison, three additional\nstructures with feature size in milliscale, microscale, and nanoscale\nwere also prepared respectively by the proposed methods. Under\nvisible light, the micro-nano structure exhibited the best performance of photodegradation. It is the result of the large specific", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Changsheng Dong 1.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/169717"}, "Penulis": "Changsheng Dong [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Minlin Zhong, Ting Huang, Mingxing Ma,Dirk Wortmann, Mihael Brajdic, Ingomar Kelbassa\u2021"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "micro-nano hierarchical structure, photo degradation, laser ablation, dealloying", "Sumber": "www.a", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Mei 2019"}
