Reservoir boundary previously determined from clay cut-off value. Pressure build-up data is analyzed by using several possible model to identify parameters from early time region, middle time region, and late time region. To determine reservoir boundary, late time region is specifically analyzed. Each model is then analyzed with the provided geological and geophysical data to make sure the certainty of it. Three possible models were assumed to be the correct model, single boundary, two parallel boundaries, and closed boundary. Single boundary and closed boundary matched the data quite well but seismic analysis did not agree well. Two parallel boundaries model is the model that was chosen. It is believed it matched with the seismic analysis also with the pressure build-up data, albeit with some few anomalies.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Maulana Insan Kamil": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/172419", "2019 TA PP MAULANA INSAN KAMIL 1.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/172420"}, "Penulis": "Maulana Insan Kamil [12215104]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
