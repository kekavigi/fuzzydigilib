{"Nomor": 32730, "Judul": "ROTATIONAL RESISTANCEAND SHEAR-INDUCED ANISOTROPY IN GRANULAR MEDIA", "Abstrak": "This paper presents a micromechanical study on the behavior of granular materials\nunder confined shear using a three-dimensional Discrete Element Method (DEM). We consider\nrotational resistance among spherical particles in the DEMcode as an approximate way to account\nfor the effect of particle shape. Under undrained shear, it is found rotational resistance may help to\nincrease the shear strength of a granular system and to enhance its resistance to liquefaction. The\nevolution of internal structure and anisotropy in granular systems with different initial conditions\ndepict a clear bimodal character which distinguishes two contact subnetworks. In the presence of\nrotational resistance, a good correlation is found between an analytical stress-force-fabric relation\nand the DEM results, in which the normal force anisotropy plays a dominant role. The unique\nproperties of critical state and liquefaction state in relation to granular anisotropy are also explored\nand discussed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jidong Zhao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ning Guo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "granular media, anisotropy, discrete element method (DEM), rotational resistance, liquefaction, critical state", "Sumber": "Science Direct", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan \u00a0\n                                     Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Jan 2019"}
