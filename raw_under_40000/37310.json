{"Nomor": 37310, "Judul": "Eects of Orientation Dynamics in Melittin as Antimicrobial Peptide in Lipid Bilayer Calculated by Free Energy Method", "Abstrak": "Melittin is a widely studied antimicrobial peptide which has gained in-\nterest because of its potential in therapeutic use. To perform its antimicrobial\nfunction, the melittin prefer to be in a certain state of membrane. In this\nstudy, we simulate the melittin in horizontal orientation towards the surface\nof membrane and in vertical orientation in transmembrane state. The free\nenergies are then calculated to asses the most favorable orientation, indicating\nits stable structure, of this peptide interacting with the lipid bilayer. Umbrella\nsampling with and without pulling simulations is carried out to obtain the\nsampling windows which used in observing the free energy changes along the\nreaction coordinate. From our simulations, we found that melittin in vertical\norientation in transmembrane state has smaller free energy value than the hor-\nizontal one indicating the melittin is more favorable in this conguration. Our\nresults show that melittin undergoes reorientation process from horizontal to\nvertical to perform its antimicrobial function.", "Daftar File": {"2015_TS_PP_SRI_RAHAYU_NATASIA_1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164119", "2015_TS_PP_SRI_RAHAYU_NATASIA_1-BAB_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164120", "2015_TS_PP_SRI_RAHAYU_NATASIA_1-BAB_2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164121", "2015_TS_PP_SRI_RAHAYU_NATASIA_1-BAB_3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164123", "2015_TS_PP_SRI_RAHAYU_NATASIA_1-BAB_4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164124", "2015_TS_PP_SRI_RAHAYU_NATASIA_1-BAB_5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164125", "2015_TS_PP_SRI_RAHAYU_NATASIA_1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164126"}, "Penulis": "Sri Rahayu Natasia [20913005]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Acep Purqon, S.Si., M.Si., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Sains Komputasi", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Natural sciences & mathematics", "Kata Kunci": "melittin, antimicrobial peptide, molecular dynamics simulation, ori- entation dynamics, umbrella sampling, free energy calculation.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Mar 2019"}
