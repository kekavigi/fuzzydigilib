The released ferrocenecontent was monitored by ultraviolet/visible spectrophotom-etry and cyclic voltammetry. The dual determination of A?Oplayed a synergetic role in the quick qualitative and precisequantitative analyses in a wide detection range of 10?5to 102?M and good feasibility in artificial cerebrospinalfluid", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Jieling_Qin_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164534"}, "Penulis": "Jieling Qin [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Misuk Cho,Youngkwan Lee"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "ZIF-8, ferrocene, amyloid beta, alzheimer\u2019s disease, dual detection", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
