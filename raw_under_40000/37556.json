The as-spunfibers were drawn inthe draw ratio (DR) range of 2?6.5, and the correlation between the PVDFchain conformation and the mechanical properties of thefibers upondrawing has been studied by two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy ofFourier-transformed infrared, wide-angle X-ray diffraction, differentialscanning calorimetry, and tensile testing. The PVDF/GO nanocompositefibers exhibited that the mobile PVDF crystals due to the conformationaldefects and kinks were nucleated because of the polar interaction betweenPVDF chains and functional groups of GO, whereas the control PVDFfibershowed the conventional conversion of crystal polymorphs (?and?phasesto?phase). As a result, the nanocompositefiber showed dramaticallyimproved toughness (enhanced by 1123% at a DR of 2 and 120% at a DR of 6.5) as compared to that of the controlfiber.Furthermore, the tensile strength and modulus of the PVDF/GO (2 wt %)fiber were 394 MPa and 4.6 GPa, respectively,whereas those of the control PVDFfiber were 295 MPa and 3.9 GPa, respectively.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Jung-Eun_Lee_2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164945"}, "Penulis": "Jung-Eun Lee [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Youngho Eom,Young-Eun Shin,Sang-Ha Hwang,Hyun-Hyub Ko,Han Gi Chae"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "poly(vinylidenefluoride), graphene oxide, conformation, toughness, nanocomposite", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
