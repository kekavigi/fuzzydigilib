{"Nomor": 32418, "Judul": "Comparison of SIFT and SURF Methods for Use on Hand Gesture Recognition Based on Depth Map", "Abstrak": "In this paper a comparison between two popular feature extraction methods is presented. Scale-invariant feature transform\n(or SIFT) is the first method. The Speeded up robust features (or SURF) is presented as second. These two methods are\ntested on set of depth maps. Ten defined gestures of left hand are in these depth maps. The Microsoft Kinect camera is\nused for capturing the images [1]. The Support vector machine (or SVM) is used as classification method. The results are\naccuracy of SVM prediction on selected images", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Peter Sykora [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Patrik Kamencay", "Robert Hudec*"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "SIFT; SURF; SVM; Kinect; depth map; hand gesture; recognition", "Sumber": "AASRI Procedia 9 ( 2014 ) 19 \u2013 24", "Staf Input/Edit": "tuti yulia", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
