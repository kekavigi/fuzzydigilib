{"Nomor": 38515, "Judul": "Body Image Discrepancy and Surgical Concerns: Thin Ideal  Internalization as a Mediator", "Abstrak": "Previous  literature  regarding  body  image  highlighted  that  surgical concerns  are  more  evident  in  \nwomen  having  distorted  body  image. However, the exposure to media images of thin-and-beautiful women creates the discrepant body image in young women leading to surgical concerns  is  not  well  understood.  Additionally,  the  role  of  thin  ideal internalization  as  a  mediator between  body  image  discrepancy  and  increasing  surgical  concerns  is  largely  unknown. The  sample  of 450 U.S. working Womenwith  Pakistani  origin (M  =  28.5;  SD=  4.36)  were taken    and    the    data    was collected using self-report questionnaires.  The  findings  revealed  that  Body  Image Discrepancy  \n(Actual vs. Media Ideal Body  Image)   have positive relationship with the surgical concerns. While \nmore discrepancy results in the increase level of thin ideal internalization. Furthermore, results from Structural Equation   Modeling   revealed   that   the   thin ideal   internalization   partially  mediate  the  relationship  between  body  image  discrepancy  and  surgical  concerns  of U.S working  women \nwith  Pakistani  origin. This  study  concludes  that women  develop  surgical concerns as  a  result  of  thin ideal  body image discrepancy  as  cultivated  by  mediaglorification of thin body ideals.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mian  Ahmad Hanan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Noshina Saleem, Arooj Arshad"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Body   image   discrepancy ,   thin   ideal   inte rnalization,  surgical concerns", "Sumber": "Journal of Behavioural Sciences, Vol. 27, No. 2, 2017", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Mei 2019"}
