{"Nomor": 36134, "Judul": "Reservoir Architecture Patterns Of Sandy Gravel Braided Distributary Channel A Case Study Of Triassic Upper Karamay Formation, Xinjiang Oilfield", "Abstrak": "The purpose of this study was to discuss shape, scale and superimposed types of sandy gravel\nbodies in sandy-gravel braided distributary channel. Lithofacies analysis, hierarchy bounding surface analysis and subsurface dense well pattern combining with outcrops method were used to\nexamine reservoir architecture patterns of sandy gravel braided distributary channel based on\ncores, well logging, and outcrops data, and the reservoir architecture patterns of sandy gravel\nbraided distributary channels in different grades have been established. The study shows: (1) The\nmain reservoir architecture elements for sandy gravel braided channel delta are distributary\nchannel and overbank sand, while reservoir flow barrier elements are interchannel and lacustrine\nmudstone. (2) The compound sand bodies in the sandy gravel braided delta distributary channel\ntake on three shapes: sheet-like distributary channel sand body, interweave strip distributary\nchannel sand body, single strip distributary channel sand body. (3) Identification marks of single\ndistributary channel include: elevation of sand body top, lateral overlaying, \u201cthick-thin-thick\u201d\nfeature of sand bodies, interchannel mudstone and overbank sand between distributary channels\nand the differences in well log curve shape of sand bodies. (4) Nine lithofacies types were distinguished in distributary channel unit interior, different channel units have different lithofacies association sequence", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SENLIN YIN  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zhangming Hu", "Xiang Ren", "Xiaojun Wu", "Yanhui Chen", "Lijun Zheng", "Zhibin Jiang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Distributary channel, Gravel braided channel delta, Reservoir architecture, 31st section of Pinglianggou, Block Yizhong", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 2, Pages 117-129 (June 2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Mar 2019"}
