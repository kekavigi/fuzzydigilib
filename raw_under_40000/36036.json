Fo?rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-basedfluorescence labeling approaches are promising toolsto study nanoparticle stability under different physiologicalconditions. Here,we present the FRET-based stabilityassessment of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nano-particles encapsulating BODIPY-FL12 and Nile Red as thedonor and acceptor, respectively. The stability of PLGAnanoparticles is studied via monitoring the variations offluorescence emission characteristics along with colloidalcharacterization. Accordingly, PLGA nanoparticles are colloi-dally stable for more than 2 weeks when incubated in aqueous buffers in situ, whereas in vitro particle degradation starts inbetween 24 and 48 h, reaching a complete loss of FRET at 72 h as shown withfluorescence microscopy imaging andflowcytometry analysis. PLGA nanoparticles systemically administered to mice predominantly accumulate in the liver, in whichFRET no longer takes place at time points as early as 24 h postadministration as determined by ex vivo organ imaging andflowcytometry analysis. The results of this study expand our knowledge on drug release and degradation behavior of PLGAnanoparticles under different physiological conditions, which will prove useful for the rational design of PLGA-basedformulations for various applications that can be translated into clinical practice", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Edyta_Swider_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/161471"}, "Penulis": "Edyta Swider, [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sanish Maharjan,Karlijne Houkes,Nicolaas Koen van Riessen,Carl Figdor,Mangala Srinivas,Oya Tagit"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "FRET, polymeric nanoparticles, PLGA, in vivo stability, drug delivery", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
