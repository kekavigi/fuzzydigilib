{"Nomor": 36905, "Judul": "The Research On Method Of Interlayer Modeling Based On Seismic Inversion And Petrophysical Facies", "Abstrak": "Currently, the three-dimensional distribution of interlayer is realized by stochastic modeling.\nTraditionally, the three-dimensional geological modeling controlled by sedimentary facies models\nis built on the basis of logging interpretation parameters and geophysical information. Because of\nshallow gas-cap, the quality of three-dimensional seismic data vertical resolution in research area\ncannot meet the interlayer research that is below ten meters. Moreover, sedimentary facies cannot\ncommendably reveal interlayer distribution and the well density is very sparse in research area. So,\nit is difficult for conventional technology to finely describe interlayers. In this document, it uses L1-\nL2 combined norm constrained inversion to enhance the recognition capability of interlayer in\nseismic profile and improve the signal to noise ratio, the wave group characteristics and the vertical\nresolution of three-dimensional data and classifies petrophysical facies of interlayer based on core,\nsedimentary facies and logging interpretation. The interlayer model which is based on seismic\ninversion model and petrophysical facies can precisely simulate the distribution of reservoir and\ninterlayer. The results show that the simulation results of this new methodology are consistent with\nthe dynamic production perfectly which provide a better basis for producing and mining remaining\noil and a new interlayer modeling method for sparse well density.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Chao Cheng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wengang Yu", "Xiaojun Bai"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Interlayer ,Vertical resolution, L1-L2 combined norm constrained inversion, Petrophysical facies, Geological model", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 1, Pages 20-25 (March  2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Mar 2019"}
