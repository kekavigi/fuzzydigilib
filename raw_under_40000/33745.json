{"Nomor": 33745, "Judul": "HDPE/EVOH Multilayered, High Barrier Films for Flexible Organic Photovoltaic Device Packaging", "Abstrak": "Transparent films composed of 65 alternating layers of high\ndensity polyethylene and ethylene/vinyl alcohol copolymer were produced and\nevaluated for their oxygen and water vapor barrier performance. Such high\nbarrier films are of special interest for encapsulation of flexible organic\nelectronic devices; these devices are extraordinarily sensitive to degradation by\noxygen and/or water. In the present work, the multilayered films were\nproduced using a layer multiplying process, and in some cases, they were\nfurther modified by applying organic and inorganic barrier coatings. An\noptimized film included coatings of both parylene C and alumina, achieving an\noxygen transmission rate of <10?3 cc/m2\u00b7day and a water vapor transition rate\nof 4.6 \u00d7 10?4 g/m2\u00b7day; these values are useful in encapsulating organic\nphotovoltaic devices.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mingze Sun [- ]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sunsheng Zhu, Ci Zhang, Andrew Olah, Eric Baer, David A.
