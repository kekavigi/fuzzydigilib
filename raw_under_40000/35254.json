{"Nomor": 35254, "Judul": "Application of Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence model to geoelectric and hydraulic parameters for groundwater potential zonation", "Abstrak": "The application of a GIS \u2013 based Dempster \u2013 Shafer data driven model named as evidential belief function\nEBF- methodology to groundwater potential conditioning factors (GPCFs) derived from geophysical and\nhydrogeological data sets for assessing groundwater potentiality was presented in this study. The proposed\nmethod\u2019s efficacy in managing degree of uncertainty in spatial predictive models motivated this\nresearch. The method procedural approaches entail firstly, the database containing groundwater data\nrecords (bore wells location inventory, hydrogeological data record, etc.) and geophysical measurement\ndata construction. From the database, different influencing groundwater occurrence factors, namely aquifer\nlayer thickness, aquifer layer resistivity, overburden material resistivity, overburden material thickness,\naquifer hydraulic conductivity and aquifer transmissivity were extracted and prepared. Further,\nthe bore well location inventories were partitioned randomly into a ratio of 70% (19 wells) for model\ntraining and 30% (9 wells) for model testing. The synthesized of the GPCFs via applying the DS \u2013 EBF\nmodel algorithms produced the groundwater productivity potential index (GPPI) map which demarcated\nthe area into low \u2013 medium, medium, medium \u2013 high and high potential zones. The analyzed percentage\ndegree of uncertainty for the predicted lows potential zones classes and mediums/highs potential zones\nclasses are >10% and <10%, respectively. The DS theory model-based GPPI map\u2019s validation through ROC\napproach established prediction rate accuracy of 88.8%. Successively, the determined transverse resistance\n(TR) values in the range of 1280 and 30,000 O my for the area geoelectrically delineated aquifer\nunits of the predicted potential zones through Dar \u2013 Zarrouk Parameter analysis quantitatively confirm\nthe DS theory modeling prediction results. This research results have expand the capability of DS \u2013\nEBF model in predictive modeling by effective uncertainty management. Thus, the produced map could\nform part of decision support system reliable to be used by local authorities for groundwater exploitation\nand management in the area", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Kehinde Anthony Mogaji [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hwee San Lim"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "ROC DS-EBF Resistivity imaging Groundwater - potential Uncertainty Dar \u2013 Zarrouk Parameter Geoelectric Hydraulic", "Sumber": "NRIAG Journal of Astronomy and Geophysics 7 (2018) 134\u2013148, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrjag.2017.12.008", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Feb 2019"}
