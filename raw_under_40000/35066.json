Taking a real gas-condensate reservoir located in China's east\nregion as an example, first, we conducted experiments of constant composition expansion (CCE),\nconstant volume depletion (CVD), saturation pressure determination, and single flash. Next, a series\nof water/CO2 flooding experiments were been investigated, including water flooding at present\npressure 15 MPa, CO2 flooding at 25.53 MPa, 15 MPa, which repents initial pressure and present\npressure respectively. Finally, the core flooding numerical model was constructed using a generalized equation-of-state model reservoir simulator (GEM) to reveal miscible flooding mechanism\nand the seepage flow characteristics in the condensate gas reservoir with CO2 injection. A desirable\nagreement achieved in experimental results and predicted pressure volume temperature (PVT)\nproperties by the modified equation of state (EOS) in the CVD and CCE tests indicated that the\nproposed recombination method can successfully produce a fluid with the same phase behavior of\ninitial reservoir fluid with an acceptable accuracy. The modeling results confirm the experimental\nresults, and both methods indicate that significant productivity loss can occur in retrograde gas\ncondensate reservoirs when the flowing bottom-hole pressure falls below dew point pressure.\nMoreover, the results show that CO2 treatment can improve gas productivity by a factor of about\n1.39 compared with the water flooding mode. These results may help reservoir engineers and\nspecialists to restore the lost productivity of gas condensate.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zhengyuan Su  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yong Tang", "Hongjiang Ruan", "Yang Wang", "Xiaoping Wei"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Gas condensate reservoir, CO2 injection, Numerical simulations, Improved gas recovery", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 3, Issue 1, Pages 87-95 (March 2017)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Feb 2019"}
