{"Nomor": 35004, "Judul": "Using RTK and VRS in direct geo-referencing of the UAV imagery", "Abstrak": "Direct Geo-Referencing is a new technique in photogrammetry, especially in the aerial photogrammetry. Unlike\nthe Aerial Triangulation \u201cAT\u201d, this method does not require Ground Control Points \u201cGCPs\u201d, to process aerial\nphotographs into desired ground coordinates systems. Compared with the old method, this method has four\nmain advantages: faster field work, faster data processing, simple workflow and less cost. Generally, direct georeferencing using two systems, Global Navigational Satellite Systems \u201cGNSS\u201d and Inertial Navigational System\n\u201cINS\u201d. GNSS recording the camera coordinates \u201cX, Y, Z\u201d, and INS recording the camera orientation angles \u201cw, ?,\nk\u201d at the time of exposure. These parameters merged and are provided to each photograph in the processing\nstage.\nThe current paper investigates the using GNSS system for providing the linear exterior orientation \u201cEO\u201d\nparameters \u201cX, Y, Z\u201d by two techniques, real time kinematic \u201cRTK\u201d and virtual reference system \u201cVRS\u201d. The\naccuracy of the applied method is tested on topographic survey project in Switzerland. The surveyed data of the\nspecified project were collected by amateur digital camera Canon 18.2 MP, 182 captured images from approximately 85 m flight height, 18 Ground Check Point \u201cGCP\u201d determined by static GNSS. Horizontal accuracy is\n0.029 m for VRS case, 0.034 m for RTK case and vertical accuracy is 0.026 m for VRS case, 0.029 for RTK case.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "M.
