{"Nomor": 34456, "Judul": "The Impact Of Hydraulic Flow Unit & Reservoir Quality Index On Pressure Profile And Productivity Index In Multi-Segments Reservoirs", "Abstrak": "The objective of this paper is studying the impact of the hydraulic flow unit and reservoir quality\nindex (RQI) on pressure profile and productivity index of horizontal wells acting in finite reservoirs.\nSeveral mathematical models have been developed to investigate this impact. These models have\nbeen built based on the pressure distribution in porous media, depleted by a horizontal well,\nconsist of multi hydraulic flow units and different reservoir quality index. The porous media are\nassumed to be finite rectangular reservoirs having different configurations and the wellbores may\nhave different lengths. Several analytical models describing flow regimes have been derived\nwherein hydraulic flow units and reservoir quality index have been included in addition to rock and\nfluid properties. The impact of these two parameters on reservoir performance has also been\nstudied using steady state productivity index.\nIt has been found that both pressure responses and flow regimes are highly affected by the\nexistence of multiple hydraulic flow units in the porous media and the change in reservoir quality\nindex for these units. Positive change in the RQI could lead to positive change in both pressure drop\nrequired for reservoir fluids to move towards the wellbore and hence the productivity index", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SALAM AL-RBEAWI   [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Fadhil Kadhim"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Hydraulic flow unit, reservoir quality index, pressure profile , productivity index, multi-segments reservoirs, wellbore", "Sumber": "Petroleum-KeAi, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2017.05.004", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Feb 2019"}
