{"Nomor": 34521, "Judul": "Iron ore prospecting based on very low frequency-electromagnetic and geoelectrical resistivity at Wadi Abu Subeira, Northeastern Aswan, South Egypt", "Abstrak": "The serious need and high demand of iron oxides in cement industry urges to carry out critical investigation in\nvicinity of cement factories in South Egypt Governorates. The considered area Wadi Abu Subeira lies to the north\neast of Aswan. The possible occurrences of hematite in the subsurface enforced to carry out some geophysical\nmeasurements in the in the form of very low frequency-electromagnetic and geoelectrical resistivity.\nA total number of 684 very low frequency-electromagnetic and 54 vertical electrical soundings stations were\nexecuted along 9 surveying profiles arranged on three long traverses, running from west to east direction. The\ndata sets were comprehensively and steadily inverted/transformed in terms of subsurface electric resistivity/EMequivalent\ncurrent-density. Both the vertical and lateral resistivity/current-density variations were able to image\nthe typical shallow stratigraphic sequence of the area. The present study emphasized the robustness and costefficiency\nof applying the very low frequency-electromagnetic and geoelectrical resistivity techniques in a field\nlike iron ore exploration.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mahmoud A.A.
