{"Nomor": 38330, "Judul": "Online Collaboration in Design Education: an Experiment in Real-Time Manipulation of Prototypes and Communication", "Abstrak": "The features of collaboration in design education include effective and efficient communication and\nreflection, and feasible manipulation of design objects. For collaborative design, information and com-\nmunication technology offers educators the possibility to change design pedagogy. However, there is a\npaucity of literature on relative advantages and disadvantages of online collaboration for real-time\nmanipulation of design objects and prototypes, particularly in web design education. Using survey\ninstrumentations, this study investigated online collaborative design practices with an application by\nmeasuring experiences of communication and interaction among twelve designers who are enrolled in\na Master\u2019s programme in interactive design. The study identified barriers to online collaboration design:\n(1) real-time manipulation of design objects and prototypes may increase complexity of communication interaction;\n (2) records of communication and invisibility of team members may attenuate quality and\nfrequency of critical feedback to each other;\n(3) students\u2019 attitudes towards collaboration, individual students\u2019 learning goals, and completing tasks in a timely manner could reduce their engagement and increase their reliance on teacher intervention.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Neal Dreamson [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "collaborative applications, communication tools, design collaboration, design pedagogy, online collabo- ration", "Sumber": "THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION, 2017", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Mei 2019"}
