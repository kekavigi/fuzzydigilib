{"Nomor": 33211, "Judul": "Ozone-like layer in an exoplanet atmosphere", "Abstrak": "Deciphering the chemical properties of atmospheres using remote sensing is the next frontier in exoplanetary science1. Short of mastering interstellar travel,it is the only conceivable path towards probing whether exoplanets are habitable or inhabited2. Hot Jupiters are a class of exoplanet witha size comparable to that of Jupiter and short orbital periods (of typically several days). Such features make hot Jupiters a good starting point for astronomers to hone their observational and theoretical techniques as they work their way towards examining smaller exoplanets that have cooler atmospheres. On page 58, Evans et al.3 report the detection of water in the thermal spectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-121b. The discovery suggests that WASP-121b contains an analogue of Earth\u2019s ozone layer, causing the exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere to feature a temperature inversion \u2014 in which temperature increases with altitude.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "KEVIN HENG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Astronomi", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Astronomi", "Sumber": "38 | NATURE | VOL 548 | 3 AUGUST 2017", "Staf Input/Edit": "pustaka bosscha", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Jan 2019"}
