However,  the  art  world  faces  another,  quieter  misstep  that\n could be \ninflicting  greater  damage  on  pieces  of  art:  restoring  them.  Whe\nn  the  boy \npunched a hole in the painting, the global community was shocke\nd. However, \nit  is  hardly  common  knowledge  that  the  Louvre\u2019s  director  of  res\ntoration \nrecently resigned after a restor\nation of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \nThe  Virgin  and  \nChild  with  Saint  Anne\n  removed  a  portion  of  da  Vinci\u2019s  original  paint  and \npermanently altered the features of the Virgin\u2019s face.\n3\n Even after ruining one \nda Vinci painting, the Louvre proceeded with plans to restore a\nnother da Vinci \nmasterpiece\u2014his painting of John the Baptist.\n4\n One art history expert publicly \ncondemned the restoration as unnecessary and called the recent \nphenomenon \nof restoring da Vinci\u2019s great works as a \u201ccontagious mania.\u201d\n5", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "CAITLIN O'RIORDAN [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Arts & recreation", "Kata Kunci": "art, conservation", "Sumber": "NATIONAL Gallery (Great Britain); Museums", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos \u00a0\n                                     Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Des 2018"}
