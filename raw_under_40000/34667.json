{"Nomor": 34667, "Judul": "Delineation potential gold mineralization zones in a part of Central Eastern Desert, Egypt using Airborne Magnetic and Radiometric data", "Abstrak": "Localization of probable gold mineralization zones in a selected part of the central Eastern Desert of Egypt has\nbeen executed by mapping lithology, structures and hydrothermal alteration zones. In this regard, both aeromagnetic and aeroradiometric data have been utilized in the analysis; by making use of some enhancement\ntechniques such as first vertical derivative, analytic signal and both Center for Exploration Targeting (CET) grid\nand porphyry. Also, ratio and ternary radiometric maps have been launched to aid in the interpretation process.\nThe results indicated that the study area is dominant by NW, NNW, NNE, WNW, NE, E-W and N-S structural\ndirections. The NW-SE was the most important one and considered as the preferred orientation of ore deposits.\nFavorable regions of ore deposits were mapped and correlated well with known gold occurrences in the study\narea beside predicting new zones of mineralization. Analysis of aeroradiometric maps facilitates the correlation\nand delineation of lithological units based on the concentration of radioelements and ratios. Also, A number of\nhydrothermal alteration zones were mapped within younger granite, Hammamat felsites and Metasediments.\nFinally, A composite map consists of geology, structures and hydrothermal altered zones was generated using\nArcGIS. Eight known locations of gold mineralization were investigated on this map and also new sites were\nsuggested to be favorable locations for mineralization emplacement.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Sayed Omar Elkhateeb [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mahmoud Ali Gaballah Abdellatif"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Aeromagnetic data Aeroradiometric data Structural complexity Mineralization", "Sumber": "NRIAG Journal of Astronomy and Geophysics, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrjag.2018.05.010", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Feb 2019"}
