{"Nomor": 34295, "Judul": "Visual-Spatial Art and Design Literacy as a Prelude to Aesthetic Growth", "Abstrak": "In bridging ideas from the forum of visual-spatial learning with those of art and design learning, inspira-\ntion is taken from Piaget who explained that the evolution of spatial cognition occurs through percep-\ntion, as well as through thought and imagination. Insights are embraced from interdisciplinary\neducational theorists, intertwining and dividing their contributions along Piaget\u2019s lines into three interre-\nlated aspects: perceptual, intellectual, and imaginative. In the quest for early literacy, the perception and ordering of universals of form, the formation and wielding of internal intellectual constructs, and the\nconstruction of metaphorical and imaginative ideas and creations are all involved in aesthetic growth.\nWith further understanding, the arena of visual-spatial learning as enhanced by art and design learning,\nmay find more inclusion in general education.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Fern Lerner [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "art and design education, visual-spatial, cognition, universal form, interdisciplinary, systemic design research", "Sumber": "THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION, 2018", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Feb 2019"}
