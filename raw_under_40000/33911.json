{"Nomor": 33911, "Judul": "Catalytic Performance Of Cu- And Zr-Modified Beta Zeolite Catalysts In The Methylation Of 2-Methylnaphthalene", "Abstrak": "2,6-Dimethylnaphthalene (2,6-DMN) is a commercially important chemical for the production of polyethylenenaphthalate\nand polybutylene naphthalate. However, its complex synthesis procedure and high production cost significantly reduce the\nuse of 2,6-DMN. In this study, the synthesis of 2,6-DMN was investigated with methylation of 2-methylnaphthalene (2-\nMN) over metal-loaded beta zeolite catalysts including beta zeolite, Cu-impregnated beta zeolite and Zr-impregnated beta\nzeolite. The experiments were performed in a fixed-bed reactor at atmospheric pressure under a nitrogen atmosphere. The\nreactor was operated at a temperature range of 400\u2013500 C and varying weight hourly space velocity between 1 and 3 h-1\n.\nThe results demonstrated that 2,6-DMN can be synthesized by methylation of 2-MN over beta type zeolite catalysts.\nBesides 2,6-DMN, the product stream also contained other DMN isomers such as 2,7-DMN, 1,3-DMN, 1,2-DMN and 2,3-\nDMN. The activity and selectivity of beta zeolite catalyst were remarkably enhanced by Zr impregnation, whereas Cu\nmodification of beta zeolite catalyst had an insignificant effect on its selectivity. The highest conversion of 2-MN reached\n81%, the highest ratio of 2,6-DMN/2,7-DMN reached 2.6 and the highest selectivity of 2,6-DMN was found to be 20% by\nusing Zr-modified beta zeolite catalyst.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "FATIH GULE\u00c7  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Farooq Sher", "Ali Karaduman"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Methylation, Naphthalene derivatives, Polyethylenenaphthalate, 2,6-Dimethylnaphthalene and beta zeolite catalyst", "Sumber": "Petroleum Science (2019) 16:161\u2013172 https://doi.org/10.1007/s12182-018-0278-2", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Jan 2019"}
