{"Nomor": 33992, "Judul": "Enzyme-Identified Phosphorus Limitation Linked to More Rapid Headloss Accumulation in Drinking Water Biofilters", "Abstrak": ": Drinking water biofilters can improve water\nquality by transforming contaminants or their precursors, but\nthey also can develop headloss more rapidly than do abiotic\nfilters. Phosphorus supplementation has been proposed as one\nstrategy to lengthen biofilter run times, but the impact of this\nstrategy in field tests has been mixed. The current bench-scale\nstudy found that severe phosphorus limitation, as indicated by\na high phosphatase to total glycosidase activity ratio\n(PHO:GLY), led to 230% higher headloss accumulation rate\nwhen particles were loaded onto the biofilters as compared to\nthe same experiment performed under a mild phosphorus\nlimitation. Phosphorus limitation was associated with higher\nconcentrations of extracellular polymeric substances, lower\nbiomass concentrations, a more filamentous biofilm morphology, and increased relative abundance of Hyphomicrobiaceae (a\nfamily of stalked bacteria) on the biofilter media. These differences in the biofilm likely contributed to higher headloss. This\nwork suggests that phosphorus supplementation could improve biofilter hydraulics in the field if the biofilter is severely\nphosphorus limited, which was indicated by a PHO:GLY greater than 154 under the conditions tested in this study.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Sarah E.
