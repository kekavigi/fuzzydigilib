{"Nomor": 34774, "Judul": "CHARACTERIZING VORTEX TANGLE PROPERTIES IN STEADY-STATE HE II COUNTERFLOWUSING PARTICLE TRACKING VELOCIMETRY", "Abstrak": "Historically, there has been little faith in particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) as a tool\nto make quantitative measurements of thermal counterflow in He II, since tracer particle\nmotion is complicated by influences from the normal fluid, superfluid, and quantized\nvortex lines, or a combination thereof. Recently, we introduced a scheme for differentiating\nparticles trapped on vortices (G1) from particles entrained by the normal fluid (G2).\nIn this paper, we apply this scheme to demonstrate the utility of PTV for quantitative\nmeasurements of vortex dynamics in He II counterflow.We estimate , the mean vortex line\nspacing, using G2 velocity data, and c2, a parameter related to the mean curvature radius\nof vortices and energy dissipation in quantum turbulence, using G1 velocity data. We find\nthat both estimations show good agreement with existing measurements that were obtained\nusing traditional experimental methods. This is of particular consequence since these\nparameters likely vary in space, and PTV offers the advantage of spatial resolution. We\nalso show a direct link between power-law tails in transverse particle velocity probability\ndensity functions (PDFs) and reconnection of vortex lines on which G1 particles are\ntrapped.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "BRIAN MASTRACCI AND WEI GUO [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS 4, 023301 (2019); \u00a92019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Feb 2019"}
