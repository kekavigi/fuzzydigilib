{"Nomor": 35196, "Judul": "An evaluation of the environmental benefit and energy footprint of China's stricter wastewater standards: Can benefit be increased?", "Abstrak": "In 2015, almost 25% of China's lakes were polluted to the point of being unfit for any purpose. In the same\nyear, China introduced plans to upgrade hundreds of existing and planned wastewater treatment plants\nto China's highest standard for wastewater discharge. The goal of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, it aims to\nhelp policy makers in China understand the impact of China's new wastewater standard on energy use.\nSecondly, it aims to provide policy makers with suggestions to increase the environmental benefit gained\nfrom reducing wastewater contaminant discharge. The most recent data from around 5000 wastewater\ntreatment plants in China are used to estimate the extra electricity required to upgrade a plant from\nChina's commonly used Class 1B municipal wastewater discharge standard to the highest discharge\nstandard, Class 1A. Results show that implementing Class 1A instead of Class 1B tends to use 2%e36%\nmore electricity. This result was used to estimate the overall increase in electricity used over five years by\nthe Chinese wastewater sector due to the introduction of the new policy, an increase that was estimated\nto be 3e63% of annual electricity used for wastewater treatment. The environmental benefit and electricity\ncost of three scenarios aimed at reducing wastewater contaminant discharge were compared.\nResults showed that the benefit-to-cost ratio of implementing stricter standards is greatly improved (by\nover seven times) when wastewater is not discharged into the environment but instead reused to replace\nfreshwater for purposes that can be met with Class 1A standard. This result has implications for policy\nmakers seeking to increase energy use efficiency, minimise water wastage and reduce environmental\npollution within cities.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Kate Smith [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Shengjie Guo.,Qinhan Zhu.,Xin Dong.,Shuming Liu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Wastewater Electricity Standards Discharge Wastewater reuse", "Sumber": "Journal of Cleaner Production 219 (2019) 723-733", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Feb 2019"}
