Nowhere is this more evident than in learning a foreign language. Typical\nlanguage interaction exercises in class do not mirror real-life language use and such\nactivities may have negative effects on students\u2019 development of robust knowledge. This\narticle describes a design-based research study that investigated the use of an authentic\ne-learning environment in a course of English language at a university preparatory\nschool. The findings suggest that the use of critical elements of authentic activities is the\nkey to achieving authentic learning in these contexts. An important outcome of\nthe research was the development of a framework for the design of authentic activities\nto be used in the teaching of foreign languages, in the form of 11 design principles.\nThese principles contribute both theoretically and practically to understanding of how\nstudents learn languages in meaningful contexts.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ildeniz Ozverir [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jan Herrington and Ulker Vanci Osam"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Design. learning, language", "Sumber": "British Journal of Educational Technology Vol 47 No 3 2016 484\u2013493", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Mei 2019"}
