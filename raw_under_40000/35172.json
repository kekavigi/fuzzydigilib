{"Nomor": 35172, "Judul": "Mother Knows Best: Deciphering the Antibacterial Properties of Human Milk Oligosaccharides", "Abstrak": "This Account describes the risky propositionof organizing a multidisciplinary team to interrogate a\nchallenging problem in chemical biology: characterizing howhuman milk, at the molecular level, protects infants frominfectious diseases. At the outset, our initial hypothesis wasthat human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) possess antimicrobial and antivirulence activities. Early on, we discovered that HMOs do indeed modulate bacterial growth and biofilm production for numerous bacterial pathogens. In light of this discovery, three priorities emerged for our program moving forward. The first was to decode the mode of action behind\nthis activity. ......", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Kelly M.
