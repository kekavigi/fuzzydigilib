{"Nomor": 38470, "Judul": "Bauhaus  Hausfraus : Gender  Formation  In  Design  Education", "Abstrak": "This essay examines the crisis of masculinity at the Bauhaus and links it  to a broader crisis in    patriarchy after the First World War. Bauhaus reminis-cences and depictions of Bauhaus students \nand buildings in    the catalog of the 1938 MoMA Bauhaus exhibition show a re-enactment of war \ntrauma in Bauhaus theatre and festivals. These and other experiments led to radical and subsequently \nconservative revisions of masculine identity. The paper suggests that the construction of a new \ndisciplinary identity through institutional and media reproduction rather than its economically limited \ninnovations in    mass production forms the real legacy of the Bauhaus for thetwentieth century. \nThe essay draws heavily on personal statements by Bauhaus students and masters, and juxtaposes \nthese with theoretical analysesof masculine formation. This technique at least in    part allows for the \ntheorists and historical subjects to speak for themselves", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "KATERINA  RUEDI  RAY [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "bauhasus, gender, design, education", "Sumber": "Journal of Architectural Education pp 73-80", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Mei 2019"}
