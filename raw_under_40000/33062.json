{"Nomor": 33062, "Judul": "Effect of changing biomass source on radiative heat transfer during co-firing of high-sulfur content lignite in fluidized bed combustors", "Abstrak": "In this study, effect of changing biomass source on radiative heat transfer during co-firing of high-sulfur\ncontent lignite in the freeboard of 300 kWt Atmospheric Bubbling Fluidized Bed Combustor (ABFBC) is\ninvestigated by using an in-house developed radiation code based on Method of Lines (MOL) solution\nof Discrete Ordinates Method (DOM). The freeboard is treated as a 3D rectangular enclosure containing\ngray, absorbing, emitting gas with absorbing, emitting, anisotropically scattering particles surrounded by\nblack/gray diffuse walls. Radiative properties of participating gases are evaluated by using Leckner\u2019s correlations\nand gray particle properties are calculated based on Planck\u2019s distribution from the spectral Mie\nsolutions. Input data required for the model are provided from six combustion tests which were previously\ncarried out for \u00c7an lignite with 14, 35 and 50% thermal shares of olive residue and hazelnut shells\nin the fuel mixture for the same Ca/S ratio. The results show that changing the biomass source affects the\nradiative properties of the particles in the freeboard through the change of particle size distribution\nrather than optical properties, which may lead to significant variations in radiative wall heat fluxes\nand source terms.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Cihan Ates [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Nevin Sel\u00e7uk, Gorkem Kulah"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Biomass supply, Co-firing, Radiative heat transfer, Fluidized bed combustor, Boiler efficiency", "Sumber": "Science Direct", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Jan 2019"}
