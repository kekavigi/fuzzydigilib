{"Nomor": 38168, "Judul": "Creating Permanent Housing Affordability: Lessons From German Cooperative Housing Models", "Abstrak": "The United States and Germany, as major economic and world powers and, respectively, the first\nand second largest destination for immigrants worldwide, are each faced with their own unique\nchallenges in creating economic opportunity for their most vulnerable residents. Moreover, in both\nGermany and the United States, the location, quality, and quantity of affordable housing is one of\nthe most significant factors in creating greater equality of opportunity (Katz, Noring, and Garrelts,\n2016). This article explores Germany\u2019s use of cooperative housing as a platform for long-term\naffordable housing and better economic outcomes for low- and moderate-income persons. In the\nUnited States, shared equity housing models, which typically take the form of community land\ntrusts and cooperative housing, have become increasingly popular in the past few years, in part, as\na local response to increases in inequality. Germany has a robust market for cooperative housing\nwith around 2,000 cooperative projects offering approximately 2.2 million units (Bundesministerium, 2017). Lessons from Germany\u2019s experience with cooperative housing can inform recent\nefforts in the United States.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Kathryn Reynolds  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Housing affordability ; housing models ; German", "Sumber": "https://search.proquest.com/docview/2117115700/fulltextPDF/994BF92E01CE4738PQ/23?accountid=31562", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur \u00a0\n                                     Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Mei 2019"}
