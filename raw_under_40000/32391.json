{"Nomor": 32391, "Judul": "Strongly fault-secure designs for arithmetic arrays", "Abstrak": "In the paper we make a comparative\nstudy of two techniques to design error-detectable\narray architectures. These techniques are the\nredundant binary representation (RBR) where the\ndata is encoded in the 1-out-of-3 code; and the\ntwo-rail logic where the data is encoded in the\n1-out-of-2 code. In recent work, the RBR has been\nused to achieve online error detection and localisation\nby checking the data on the array borders.\nHere we show that another approach is also possible,\nwith less hardware cost, where the checking\ntakes place on the local (processor) level. This provides\nimmediate error detection without delay.\nThe performance of the RBR approaches has been\ncompared with the two-rail approach. The results\nshow that the RBR approaches require more\nhardware overheads, for small word lengths (n).\nHowever, the hardware cost of the two techniques\nare approximately the same for large n, while the\nRBR approaches offer much faster arithmetics for\nall n.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "J.M.
