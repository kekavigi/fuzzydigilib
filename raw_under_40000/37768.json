{"Nomor": 37768, "Judul": "Nonlinear approach to spectral ratio method for estimation of seismic quality factor from VSP data", "Abstrak": "Conventional spectral ratio method for estimating Seismic Quality factor (Q) involves log-linearization\nand least square fitting, which is very sensitive to noise. In this work we have proposed a new approach to\nspectral ratio method, where the seismic quality factor is estimated by non-linear inversion of spectral\nratios using Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) method. The efficacy of the proposed methodology has been\ntested on synthetic and real VSP datasets. Both conventional log-spectral ratio method (LSR)and\nnonlinear optimization method (LM) could effectively estimate the Q model for datasets having good\nsignal to noise ratio. Numerical tests indicated that with increase in noise floor LM method provided more\naccurate and stable results. Application on real VSP dataset having high S/N ratio revealed that the\nestimated Q models using both the approaches are almost similar. Results demonstrate a reasonable\ncorrelation of Q model in sand-shale sequence and low Q values around 69 in gas reservoir", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Pardeep Sangwan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dinesh Kumar, Subrata Chakraborty, Vidya Mundayat, M.K.
