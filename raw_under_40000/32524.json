However, few\nstudies attempt to identify the cultural traits most relevant to the specific technology being examined.\nThe main purpose of this study is to develop measures for cultural characteristics of individual users with\na specific information technology, the mobile Internet. We propose measures for four cultural characteristics\nimportant in the context of the mobile Internet, which are expected to be widely used in the future.\nThe proposed measures were verified empirically through online surveys conducted in seven countries.\nThe results indicate that the measures have high validity and reliability, as well as comparability\namong the seven countries. The paper ends with a discussion of the study\u2019s limitations and implications.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Inseong Lee [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jinwoo Kim", "Boreum Choi", "Se-Joon Hong"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Culture Mobile Internet Individualism Uncertainty avoidance Contextuality Time perception", "Sumber": "Computers in Human Behavior 26 (2010) 1355\u20131368", "Staf Input/Edit": "ilham rahayu", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
