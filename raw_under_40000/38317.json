{"Nomor": 38317, "Judul": "On the networking synthesis of studio factors to the integration of design pedagogy", "Abstrak": "Studio is critically important for design education, but few attempts have been madeto demonstrate\nthe parallels between studio factors and design performance. This paper adopts a coherent set\nof analyses to investigate the major studio factors and attempts to quantify the                                        networking interactions among them. First, it describes how architectural studio is usually\norganised based on some major factors. Next, a theoretical model is established according\nto the described hypotheses and their mutual interactions. Third, the research method and statistical\nanalysis with structural equation modelling (SEM) are presented. Finally, the results of this empirical examination are presented for discussion and suggestions.Our findings reveal that studio tutorials\nhave no significant effect on undergraduate\u2019s design performance. In contrast, students\u2019 subjective\nintention plays a more important role in shaping their behaviour, indicating the importance of transferring those exterior forces into internal benefits when the studio instructor attempts to optimise\nthe pedagogy. These findings are also inspiring for all creative disciplines", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zheng-Hui Wang  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xin Li ,   Shih-Chih Chen, Chiu-Shui Chan, Penny Lewis, Ihab Hijazi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Social science, educational design, research design", "Sumber": "PLOS ONE, March 2019", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Mei 2019"}
