{"Nomor": 32927, "Judul": "Lessons Learned From Applying A New Hra Method For The Petroleum Industry", "Abstrak": "Petro-HRA is a new human reliability analysis method developed for the petroleum industry. The human error\nquantification step in the Petro-HRA method was adapted from the Standardized Plant Analysis Risk-Human\nReliability Analysis (SPAR-H) method, which was originally developed for nuclear applications. During the\nPetro-HRA project, emphasis was placed on evaluating and adapting the SPAR-H quantification process to make\nit more suitable to a petroleum context. In addition, since HRA is relatively new to the petroleum industry,\nemphasis was also placed on the development of guidance for how to perform qualitative analysis to inform and\nprovide the necessary substantiation for human error quantification and human error reduction. Petro-HRA is\nthus considered to be a \u201ccomplete\u201d method. This paper describes the key differences between the petroleum and\nnuclear industries, which created the need for a new HRA method. An overview of the Petro-HRA method is\nprovided, and we document our observations and experiences from application of this new method in case\nstudies and in commercial practice", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "CLAIRE TAYLORA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sondre \u00d8ie, Kristian Gould"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Human Reliability Analysis, HRA, Qualitative analysis, Quantitative analysis, Petroleum Lessons learned", "Sumber": "Reliability Engineering and System Safety, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2018.10.001", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Jan 2019"}
