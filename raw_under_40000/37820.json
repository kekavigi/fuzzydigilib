{"Nomor": 37820, "Judul": "NONLINEAR AND QUASI-LINEAR BEHAVIOR OFA CURVED CARBONNANOTUBE VIBRATINGINAN ELECTRIC FORCE FIELD; ANANALYTICAL APPROACH", "Abstrak": "The nonlinear vibrational model of a slightly curved single-walled carbon nanotube\n(SWCNT) resting on aWinkler-type elastic foundation is developed using nonlocal Euler- Bernoulli\nelastic theory. The SWCNT is assumed to vibrate under an external harmonic electric force field\nand an analytical solution is proposed to obtain the nonlinear resonant frequencies. The results\nshow good agreement with the numerical simulation and the obtained analytical frequency is completely\nrelated to the curvature of the nanotube. Our model predicts that although the model is\nnonlinear in nature, the curved SWCNT could behave linearly in a certain amount of curvatures\nand this quasi-linear vibrational behavior of curved SWCNT is a function of aspect ratio, nonlocal parameter, and stiffness of the foundation.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "P.
