{"Nomor": 34302, "Judul": "Decontamination of radioactive wastewater: State of the art and challenges forward", "Abstrak": "Radioactive substances have been widely used in many industrial sectors, e.g. nuclear power station,\nbiomedical engineering, etc. With increasing applications of nuclear technology, more and more radioactive wastewater is being generated via different channels, which indeed is posing an emerging challenge and threat to the environment and human health. Given such a situation, this review attempts to\noffer a holistic view with regard to the state of the art of technology for decontamination of radioactive\nwastewater as well as shed lights on the challenges forward. Different from reclamation of other types of\nwastewaters, the most challenging issue in decontamination of radioactive wastewater is the effective\nstabilization and solidification of soluble radioactive nuclides present in wastewater, which are critical\nfor final disposal. Moreover, the potential risk of human exposure to wastewater radiation needs to be\ncarefully assessed, and this issue should also be taken into consideration in the selection, design and\noperation of the radioactive wastewater treatment process. These clearly differentiate the treatment\nprinciple of radioactive wastewater from those of traditional industrial and municipal wastewaters.\nLastly, the challenges from the perspectives of technology development, environmental and human\nhealth impacts and possible solutions forward are also elucidated.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xiaoyuan Zhang  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ping Gu.,Yu Liu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Radioactive wastewater Soluble radionuclides Decontamination technology Preconcentration Solidification Human health", "Sumber": "Chemosphere 215 (2019) 543-553", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Feb 2019"}
