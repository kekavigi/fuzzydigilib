{"Nomor": 35572, "Judul": "Treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater using combined approach of Fenton applications and aerobic biological treatment", "Abstrak": "The pharmaceutical wastewater of different organic loads i.e. high (HSW) and low strength\nwastewater (LSW) were collected from the bulk pharmaceutical industry and subjected to\ndifferent applications of Fenton\u2019s treatment followed by subsequent biological treatment. For\nboth the HSW and LSW, applications of Fenton such as, dark-Fenton (DF), solar driven photoFenton (PF) and electro-Fenton (EF) were utilized as pre-treatment technologies to improve the\nbiodegradability and reduce the organic load of wastewater by combine oxidation and\ncoagulation. The operational parameters like pH, hydrogen peroxide dosage and iron\nconcentration were optimized in case of DF and PF processes, whereas in case of EF process,\napplied voltage and hydrogen peroxide dosage were optimized to make water biocompatible for\nsubsequent biological degradation. The use of Fenton applications as a pre-treatment resulted in\na significant enhancement in the BOD5/COD ratio validating the production of easily degradable\nmetabolites or secondary products. Overall results indicated that among the utilized Fenton\ntechnologies, pre-treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater with PF lead to better COD and TOC\nremoval efficiency with subsequent biological degradation when compared to DF and EF pretreatment. Overall COD removal efficiency of the combined PF and biological treatment was\naround 84% for LSW and 82% for HSW. Conclusively, it can be established that combined\nFenton applications as pretreatment technology and biological treatment is more effective\napproach in comparison to single stage oxidation either by Fenton or biological treatment.\nCytotoxicity assessment revealed that complete detoxification of wastewaters were achieved\nindicating that hybrid treatment technology of Fenton\u2019s and biological treatment did not\nexhibited any toxicity against the selected microbes.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": ": Rahil Changotra [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Himadri Rajpu.,Amit Dhir"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Real pharmaceutical wastewater; dark-Fenton; photo-Fenton; electro-Fenton; biological treatment; cytotoxicity.", "Sumber": "Accepted Manuscript", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Feb 2019"}
