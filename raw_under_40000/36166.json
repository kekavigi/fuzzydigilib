{"Nomor": 36166, "Judul": "Low Parameter Model To Monitor Bottom Hole Pressure In Vertical Multiphase Flow In Oil Production Wells", "Abstrak": "The importance of the flow patterns through petroleum production wells proved for upstream\nexperts to provide robust production schemes based on the knowledge about flow behavior. To\nprovide accurate flow pattern distribution through production wells, accurate prediction/representation of bottom hole pressure (BHP) for determining pressure drop from bottom to surface play\nimportant and vital role. Nevertheless enormous efforts have been made to develop mechanistic\napproach, most of the mechanistic and conventional models or correlations unable to estimate or\nrepresent the BHP with high accuracy and low uncertainty. To defeat the mentioned hurdle and\nmonitor BHP in vertical multiphase flow through petroleum production wells, inventive intelligent\nbased solution like as least square support vector machine (LSSVM) method was utilized. The\nevolved first-break approach is examined by applying precise real field data illustrated in open\nprevious surveys. Thanks to the statistical criteria gained from the outcomes obtained from LSSVM\napproach, the proposed least support vector machine (LSSVM) model has high integrity and performance. Moreover, very low relative deviation between the model estimations and the relevant\nactual BHP data is figured out to be less than 6%. The output gained from LSSVM model are closed\nthe BHP while other mechanistic models fails to predict BHP through petroleum production wells.\nProvided solutions of this study explicated that implies of LSSVM in monitoring bottom-hole\npressure can indicate more accurate monitoring of the referred target which can lead to robust\ndesign with high level of reliability for oil and gas production operation facilities.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mohammad Ali Ahmadi  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Morteza Galedarzadeh", "Seyed Reza Shadizadeh"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Bottom hole pressure ; Multiphase flow ; Production well ; Least square support vector machine ; Genetic algorithm", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 3, Pages 282-266 (September  2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Mar 2019"}
