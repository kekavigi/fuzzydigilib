{"Nomor": 32965, "Judul": "Development Of An Artificial Neural Network Model For Prediction Of Bubble Point Pressure Of Crude Oils", "Abstrak": "Bubble point pressure is one of the most important pressureevolumeetemperature properties of crude\noil, and it plays an important role in reservoir and production engineering calculations. It can be precisely\ndetermined experimentally. Although, experimental methods present valid and reliable results, they are\nexpensive, time-consuming, and require much care when taking test samples. Some equations of state\nand empirical correlations can be used as alternative methods to estimate reservoir fluid properties (e.g.,\nbubble point pressure); however, these methods have a number of limitations. In the present study, a\nnovel numerical model based on artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed for the prediction of bubble\npoint pressure as a function of solution gaseoil ratio, reservoir temperature, oil gravity (API), and gas\nspecific gravity in petroleum systems. The model was developed and evaluated using 760 experimental\ndata sets gathered from oil fields around the world. An optimization process was performed on networks\nwith different structures. Based on the obtained results, a network with one hidden layer and six neurons\nwas observed to be associated with the highest efficiency for predicting bubble point pressure. The\nobtained ANN model was found to be reliable for the prediction of bubble point pressure of crude oils\nwith solution gaseoil ratios in the range of 8.61e3298.66 SCF/STB, temperatures between 74 and\n341.6 F, oil gravity values of 6e56.8 API and gas gravity values between 0.521 and 3.444. The performance of the developed model was compared against those of several well-known predictive empirical\ncorrelations using statistical and graphical error analyses. The results showed that the proposed ANN\nmodel outperforms all of the studied empirical correlations significantly and provides predictions in\nacceptable agreement with experimental data", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "AREF HASHEMI FATH [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Abdolrasoul Pouranfard, Pouyan Foroughizadeh"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Artificial neural network, Bubble point pressure, Empirical correlation, Statistical analysis", "Sumber": "Petroleum 4 (2018) 281-291 - KeAi, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.03.009", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Jan 2019"}
