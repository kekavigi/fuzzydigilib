{"Nomor": 37371, "Judul": "Photoconversion of FM1-43 Reveals Differences in Synaptic Vesicle Recycling and Sensitivity to Pharmacological Disruption of Actin Dynamics in Individual Synapses", "Abstrak": "The cycling of synaptic vesicles ensures that neurons can communicate\nadequately through their synapses on repeated occasions when activity is sustained,\nand several steps in this cycle are modulated by actin. The effects of pharmacological\nstabilization of actin with jasplakinolide or its depolymerization with latrunculin A was\nassessed on the synaptic vesicle cycle at individual boutons of cerebellar granule cells,\nusing FM1-43 imaging to track vesicle recycling and its photoconversion to specifically\nlabel recycled organelles. Remarkable differences in the recycling capacity of individual\nboutons are evident, and their dependence on the actin cytoskeleton for recycling is\nclear. Disrupting actin dynamics causes a loss of functional boutons, and while this\nindicates that exo/endocytotic cycling in boutons is fully dependent on such events,\nthis dependence is only partial in other boutons. Indeed, exocytosis and vesicle\ntrafficking are impaired significantly by stabilizing or depolymerizing actin, whereas\nrepositioning recycled vesicles at the active zone seems to be dependent on actin\npolymerization alone. These findings support the hypothesis that different steps of\nsynaptic vesicle cycling depend on actin dynamics and that such dependence varies among individual boutons.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Alberto Ramperez [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["David Bartolome-Mart\u00edn, Angeles Garc\u00eda-Pascual, Jose Sanchez-Prieto, Magdalena Torres"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Actin dynamics, cerebellar granule cells, FM1-43, jasplakinolide, latrunculin A, synaptotagmin", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Mar 2019"}
