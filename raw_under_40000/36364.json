{"Nomor": 36364, "Judul": "A Generative Theory of Shape", "Abstrak": "In A Generative Theory of Shape Michael Leyton presents an extremely rich and compelling\ntheory with foundations in and applications to art and architecture, music, math, physics,\npsychology, computer science, mechanical design and manufacturing, and CAD. As is standard,\nshapes are viewed as originating from primitive shapes (e.g., circles, squares, cubes, cylinders, etc.),\nprimitives themselves are ultimately defined from the fundamental building blocks (point, line,\nplane, etc.), and shapes are mathematically specified using group theory. What is different about\nLeyton\u2019s theory is that the information necessary to generate a given shape is recoverable from the\nmathematical definition of the shape. This generative approach is in contrast to the standard\nKlein geometry, where a shape is defined as an invariant under specified group transformations.\nLeyton describes this standard approach as memoryless, since the shape\u2019s generation is ignored\nrather than stored for later recovery. By contrast, his theory works by capturing the evolution of\nthe shape from the building blocks, rather than merely specifying the end result. Leyton\u2019s\napproach has the additional benefit of allowing for the complete mathematical specification of\nquite complex shapes.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Michael Leyton [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Architectural structure", "Kata Kunci": "Generative Theory", "Sumber": "NEXUS NETWORK JOURNAL \u2013 VOL. 6, NO. 1, 2004", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Mar 2019"}
