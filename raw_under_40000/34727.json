{"Nomor": 34727, "Judul": "Penicillium citrinum whole-cells catalyst for the treatment of lipid-rich wastewater", "Abstrak": "The performance of Penicillium citrinum whole cells in decreasing lipid and organic contents in dairy wastewater\nwas investigated using sequential and simultaneous treatment processes (enzymatic hydrolysis and anaerobic\ndigestion). Free and immobilized whole cells were used as catalysts for the treatment of dairy wastewater at pH\n4.0, 7.0, and 8.0 (optimal pH for P. citrinum whole cell activity) for 48 h. Percent hydrolysis was higher at pH 8.0.\nFree whole cells achieved a 1.3-fold higher percent hydrolysis (92.5%) than immobilized whole cells.\nBiodegradability tests were conducted using crude wastewater (E1), wastewater prehydrolyzed by whole cells\n(E2), and wastewater simultaneously submitted to whole-cell hydrolysis and biodigestion (E3). Low removal of\norganic matter was obtained in all tests (mean of 43%). E2 and E3 resulted in higher methane production rate\nthan E1, which demonstrates the benefits of combining enzymatic hydrolysis and anaerobic digestion for wastewater treatment, whether sequentially or simultaneously.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Alex M.
