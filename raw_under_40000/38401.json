{"Nomor": 38401, "Judul": "A typology of mixed methods research designs", "Abstrak": "The mixed methods paradigm is still in its adolescence, and, thus, is still relatively unknown and confusing to many researchers. In general, mixed methods research represents research that involves collecting, analyzing, and interpreting quantitative and qualitative data in a single study or in a series of studies that investigate the same underlying phenomenon. Over the last several years, a plethora of research designs have been developed. However, the number of designs that currently prevail leaves the doctoral student, the beginning researcher, and even the experienced researcher who is new to the field of mixed methods research with the challenge of selecting optimal mixed methods designs. This paper presents a three-dimensional typology of mixed methods designs that represents an attempt to rise to the challenge\nof creating an integrated typology of mixed methods designs. An example for each design is\nincluded as well as a notation system that fits our eight-design framework.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Nancy L.
