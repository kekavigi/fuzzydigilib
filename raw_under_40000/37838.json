{"Nomor": 37838, "Judul": "FINITE ELEMENTMODELING AND ROBUST VIBRATION CONTROL OFTWO-HINGED PLATE USING BONDED PIEZOELECTRIC SENSORSAND ACTUATORS", "Abstrak": "Active vibration control for a kind of two-hinged plate is developed in this paper.\nA finite element model for the hinged plate integrated with distributed piezoelectric sensors and\nactuators is derived, including bending and torsional modes of vibration. In this model, the hinges\nare simplified as regular plate elements to facilitate operation. The state space representations\nfor bending and torsional vibrations are obtained. Based on two low-order models of the bending\nand torsional motion, two H? robust controllers are designed for suppressing the vibrations of\nthe bending and torsional modes, respectively. The simulation results indicate the effectiveness\nand feasibility of the designed H? controllers. The vibration magnitudes of the low-order modes\ncan be reduced without affecting the high frequency modes.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zhicheng Qiu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Defang Ling"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "hinged plate, FEM, H? robust control, bending and torsional vibration control", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect: Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 27, No. 2, April, 2014", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Apr 2019"}
