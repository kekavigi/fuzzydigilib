{"Nomor": 33575, "Judul": "Sensing Ocean Plastics with an Airborne Hyperspectral Shortwave Infrared Imager", "Abstrak": "Here, we present a proof-of-concept on remote sensing of\nocean plastics using airborne shortwave infrared (SWIR) imagery. We\ncaptured red, green, and blue (RGB) and hyperspectral SWIR imagery\nwith equipment mounted on a C-130 aircraft surveying the \u201cGreat Pacific\nGarbage Patch\u201d at a height of 400 m and a speed of 140 knots. We\nrecorded the position, size, color, and type (container, float, ghost net,\nrope, and unknown) of every plastic piece identified in the RGB mosaics.\nWe then selected the top 30 largest items within each of our plastic type\ncategories (0.6?6.8 m in length) to investigate SWIR spectral information\nobtained with a SASI-600 imager (950?2450 nm). Our analyses revealed\nunique SWIR spectral features common to plastics. The SWIR spectra\nobtained (N = 118 items) were quite similar both in magnitude and shape.\nNonetheless, some spectral variability was observed, likely influenced by\ndifferences in the object optical properties, the level of water submersion,\nand an intervening atmosphere. Our simulations confirmed that the ?1215 and ?1732 nm absorption features have potential\napplications in detecting ocean plastics from spectral information. We explored the potential of SWIR remote sensing\ntechnology for detecting and quantifying ocean plastics, thus provide relevant information to those developing better\nmonitoring solutions for ocean plastic pollution.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Shungudzemwoyo P.
