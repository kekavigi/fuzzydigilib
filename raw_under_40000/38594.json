{"Nomor": 38594, "Judul": "Cellulosic Nanomaterials in Food and Nutraceutical Applications: A Review", "Abstrak": "Cellulosic nanomaterials (CNMs) are organic, green nanomaterials that are obtained from renewable sources\nand possess exceptional mechanical strength and biocompatibility. The associated unique physical and chemical properties have\nmade these nanomaterials an intriguing prospect for various applications including the food and nutraceutical industry. From\nthe immobilization of various bioactive agents and enzymes, emulsion stabilization, direct food additives, to the development of\nintelligent packaging systems or pathogen or pH detectors, the potential food related applications for CNMs are endless. Over\nthe past decade, there have been several reviews published covering different aspects of cellulosic nanomaterials, such as\nprocessing-structure?property relationship, physical and chemical properties, rheology, extraction, nanocomposites, etc. In this\ncritical review, we have discussed and provided a summary of the recent developments in the utilization of cellulosic\nnanomaterials in applications related to food and nutraceuticals.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Avik Khan 1.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170027"}, "Penulis": "Avik Khan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yangbing Wen,  Tanzina Huq, Yonghao Ni"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "cellulose, nanomaterials, food, emulsion stabilization, intelligent packaging, bioactive agents", "Sumber": "J.
