{"Nomor": 36368, "Judul": "Mapping Features to Aspects: A Model-Based Generative Approach", "Abstrak": "Handling the various derivations of an aspect-oriented software\nfamily architecture can be a daunting and costly task if explicit support is not\nsystematically provided throughout early and late development stages. Aspectoriented\nsoftware development (AOSD) has been recently explored as a\ntechnique that enables software product line customization. However, the\napplication of AOSD has been limited to modularize specific crosscutting\nfeatures encountered in the implementation of software product-line\narchitectures or frameworks. Only a few works have investigated the\ndevelopment of product derivation approaches for AOSD. This paper presents a\nmodel-based generative approach to mapping features to aspects across\ndifferent artifacts of a product line. Our main aim is to enable the smooth and\nsystematic derivation of aspect-oriented software family architecture. Our\napproach is complementary to a set of previously-proposed modularization\nguidelines to implement aspect-oriented frameworks. We present details about\nthe suite of mappings supported by our generative model, illustrate them in\nheterogeneous case studies, and discuss several implementation issues for its\naccomplishment.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Uir\u00e1 Kulesza [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Vander Alves, Alessandro Garcia, Alberto Costa Neto, Elder Cirilo, Carlos J.
