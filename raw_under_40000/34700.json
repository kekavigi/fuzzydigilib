{"Nomor": 34700, "Judul": "DYNAMICS OF LONG GAS BUBBLES RISING IN A VERTICAL TUBE IN A COCURRENT LIQUID FLOW", "Abstrak": "When a confined long gas bubble rises in a vertical tube in a cocurrent liquid flow, its\ntranslational velocity is the result of both buoyancy and mean motion of the liquid. A thin\nfilm of liquid is formed on the tube wall and its thickness is determined by the interplay\nof viscous, inertial, capillary and buoyancy effects, as defined by the values of the Bond\nnumber (Bo ? ?gR2/? with ? being the liquid density, g the gravitational acceleration,\nR the tube radius, and ? the surface tension), capillary number (Cab ? ?Ub/? with Ub\nbeing the bubble velocity and ? the liquid dynamic viscosity), and Reynolds number\n(Reb ? 2?UbR/?). We perform experiments and numerical simulations to investigate\nsystematically the effect of buoyancy (Bo = 0\u20135) on the shape and velocity of the bubble\nand on the thickness of the liquid film for Cab = 10?3\u201310?1 and Reb = 10?2\u2013103. A\ntheoretical model, based on an extension of Bretherton\u2019s lubrication theory, is developed\nand utilized for parametric analyses; its predictions compare well with the experimental\nand numerical data. This study shows that buoyancy effects on bubbles rising in a cocurrent\nliquid flow make the liquid film thicker and the bubble rise faster, when compared to the\nnegligible gravity case. In particular, gravitational forces impact considerably the bubble\ndynamics already when Bo < 0.842, with Bocr = 0.842 being the critical value below\nwhich a bubble does not rise in a stagnant liquid in a circular tube. The liquid film thickness\nand bubble velocity in a liquid coflow may vary by orders of magnitude as a result of small\nchanges of Bo around this critical value. The reduction of the liquid film thickness for\nincreasing values of the Reynolds numbers, usually observed for Reb  102 when Bo  1,\nbecomes more evident at larger Bond numbers. Buoyancy effects also have a significant\ninfluence on the features of the undulation appearing near the rear meniscus of the bubble,\nas they induce a substantial increase in its amplitude and decrease in its wavelength.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "M.
