In doing so, I challenge the taken-for-granted\nnotion that male physics students have an unproblematic relation to their chosen discipline,\nand nuance the picture of how working-class students relate to higher education by the\nexplicit focus on one disciplinary culture. Working from the perspective of situated learning\ntheory, the interviews with the two male students were analysed for how they negotiated the\npractice of the physics student laboratory and their own classed and gendered participation\nin this practice. By drawing on the heterogeneity of the practice of physics the two students\nwere able to use the practical and technological aspects of physics as a gateway into the\ndiscipline. However, this is not to say that their participation in physics was completely\nfrictionless. The students were both engaged in a continuous negotiation of how skills they\nhad learned to value in the background may or may not be compatible with the ones they\nperceived to be valued in the university physicist community.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ANNA T DANIELSSON [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Physics  Higher education  Social class  Gender  Masculinities", "Sumber": "Received: 27 September 2010 / Accepted: 2 June 2012 / Published online: 4 July 2012", "Staf Input/Edit": "Rina Kania", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
