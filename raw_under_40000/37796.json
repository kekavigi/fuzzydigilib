{"Nomor": 37796, "Judul": "The effect of P- and S-phase arrivals on the accuracy of microseismic source location", "Abstrak": "In this paper, the conventional microseismic monitoring is classified into two types: body and line monitoring\ncases. And the phase arrival conditions are classified into three types: 1) Only including P-arrivals and P-picks\nbeing in error; 2) Both including P- and S-arrivals and P-picks being in error; 3) Both including P- and S-arrivals\nand S-picks being in error. Then the effect of P- and S-phase arrivals on the accuracy of source location is studied\nunder six conditions. In body monitoring case, the location accuracy will be improved dramatically when S-picks\nare added. In line monitoring case, the convergence rate of location function is dramatically improved when Spicks are added. This kind of phenomena is called P-picks effect. Then a pair of mutually exclusive hypothesizes\nare put forward based on P-picks effect. And another set of numerical tests are designed to verify which one is\ntrue. The tests results show that the location accuracy and the iterative convergence rate of the objective function\ncan be dramatically improved when S-picks are added. What's more, this effect cannot be offset by increasing Ppicks. To understand this effect deeply, the location model is simplified further. The properties of location functions with or without S-picks are studied and compared. And the S-picks effect is analyzed mathematically based\non the simplified location model and the properties of objective function. Two field data tests, 81,307# workface\nmicroseismic monitoring of Baode Coal Mine and 4# branch tunnel microseismic monitoring of Hanjiang-toWeihe River Valley Water Diversion Project, are analyzed to verify the conclusion that the participation of Spicks can improve converge rate and location accuracy. In both cases, the location results with P- and S-picks\nare consistent with the rock mechanics theoretical results. Both of them confirm that S-picks are indispensable\nin source location", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mengbo Zhu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jianyuan Cheng, Liguan Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Microseismic monitoring P- and S-phase arrivals Source location Metal/coal mine Tunnel", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 164 (2019) 130\u2013139, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2019.02.008", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Apr 2019"}
