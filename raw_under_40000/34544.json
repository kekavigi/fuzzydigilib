{"Nomor": 34544, "Judul": "Productivity Model For Gas Reservoirs With Open-Hole Multi-Fracturing Horizontal Wells And Optimization Of Hydraulic Fracture Parameters", "Abstrak": "Multi-fractured horizontal wells are commonly employed to improve the productivity of low and\nultra-low permeability gas reservoirs. However, conventional productivity models for open-hole\nmulti-fractured horizontal wells do not consider the interferences between hydraulic fractures\nand the open-hole segments, resulting in significant errors in calculation results. In this article, a\nnovel productivity prediction model for gas reservoirs with open-hole multi-fractured horizontal\nwells was proposed based on complex potential theories, potential superimposition, and numerical analysis. Herein, an open-hole segment between two adjacent fractures was regarded as\nan equivalent fracture, which was discretized as in cases of artificial fractures. The proposed\nmodel was then applied to investigate the effects of various parameters, such as the angle between the fracture and horizontal shaft, fracture quantity, fracture length, diversion capacity of\nfractures, horizontal well length, and inter-fracture distance, on the productivity of low permeability gas reservoirs with multi-fractured horizontal wells. Simulation results revealed that the\nquantity, length, and distribution of fractures had significant effects on the productivity of low\npermeability gas reservoirs while the effects of the diversion capacity of fractures and the angle\nbetween the fracture and horizontal shaft were negligible. Additionally, a U-shaped distribution of\nfracture lengths was preferential as the quantity of fractures at shaft ends was twice that in the\nmiddle area.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jianqiang Xue [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Nianyin Li", "Xiaobing Lu", "Suiwang Zhang", "Yong Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Low permeability gas reservoir, Multi-fractured horizontal well, Productivity prediction, Open-hole completion, Unsteady-state flow, Fracture parameters optimization", "Sumber": "Petroleum, Volume 3, Issue 4, Pages 454-460 (December 2017)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Feb 2019"}
