{"Nomor": 36744, "Judul": "Nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics in plants and soil fertigated with decentralised wastewater treatment effluent", "Abstrak": "Municipalities in South Africa face problems in providing sanitation to unserved informal settlements in periurban areas and rural nodes. The Decentralised Wastewater Treatment System (DEWATS) connected to community ablution blocks can be an option, with the treated effluent then applied to agricultural land. However,\nthe management of treated wastewater through irrigation of crops must be environmentally sustainable. This\nstudy therefore investigated nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) dynamics in soil irrigated with DEWATS effluent. A\nfield study with banana and taro in a randomised complete block design with three blocks and two irrigation\ntreatments (DEWATS effluent without fertiliser vs tap water + fertiliser) was carried out over a period of 992\ndays at the Newlands-Mashu Research Site, Durban, South Africa. Data were collected on crop N and P uptake,\nsoil chemical properties, and nutrient leaching together with groundwater monitoring. Nitrogen and P uptake\nwas not significantly different (p > 0.05) between the two irrigation treatments. Irrigation with DEWATS effluent increased soil N and P concentrations within the upper 0.3 m implying its importance as a fertiliser source.\nLeaching of N and P from DEWATS effluent treated plots was comparable to that from the tap water + fertiliser\ntreatments. However, to manage excess water in the soil, practices such as irrigation to meet crop water re", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "W. Musazura [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["A.O.
