{"Nomor": 35482, "Judul": "Semiotics, edusemiotics and the culture of education", "Abstrak": "Semiotics is the study of signs addressing their action, usage, communication and  signification  (meaning).  Edusemiotics\u2014educational  semiotics\u2014is  a  recently  developed  direction  in educational  theory  that  takes  semiotics  as its foundational philosophy and explores the philosophical specifics of semiotics in educational contexts. As a novel theoretical field of inquiry, it is \ncomplemented by research known under the banner \u2018semiotics in education\u2019, which  is  largely  an  applied  enterprise.  In  this  respect  edusemiotics  is  a  new  conceptual  framework  for  both  theoretical  and  empirical  studies.  Edusemiotics  has  also  been  given  the  status  of  being  a  new  branch  of  theoretical semiotics and it was launched as such at the 12th World Congress \nof the International Association for Semiotic Studies in September 2014 at the New Bulgarian University in Sofia. The article presents \u2018semiosis\u2019 as the action of signs across culture AND nature and posits \u2018learning\u2019 in terms of developing semiotic consciousness and semiotic competence. Semiosis is a process and as  such  it  defies  the  Cartesian  philosophy  of  substance-dualism  that  still  informs the culture of education. The paper focuses specifically on university education permeated by disciplinary boundaries and the fragmentation of knowledge grounded in objective science inherited from modernity. Where is semiotics as the science of signs (or relations) in the context of academic culture? The authors conclude by affirming the transdisciplinary character of  semiotics  and  edusemiotics  and  specify  the  distinctive  focal  points  of  transdisciplinary knowledge afforded by edusemiotics.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "John Deely  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Inna Semetsky"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "science; Peirce\u2019s semiotics;  antidualism; process  philosophy; culture; nature", "Sumber": "Educational PhilosoPhy and  thEory, 2017 Vol. 49, no . 3, 207\u2013219", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Feb 2019"}
