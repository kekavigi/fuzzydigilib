{"Nomor": 32827, "Judul": "Study of the pyrolysis of municipal sludge in N2/CO2 atmosphere", "Abstrak": "The present study aims to explore the pyrolysis characteristics and gaseous product of municipal sludge\nincluding dry sample (DS) and wet sample (WS). The experiments were performed under atmospheres of\ndifferent N2/CO2 ratios using TG-FTIR. All of the thermal process could be divided into two stages. With\nthe existence of moisture, the releasing of volatiles was enhanced and a large amount of CO2 and NH3\ngenerated earlier. CO2 was inert in first stage and became reactive in second stage. The char gasification\nby CO2 resulted in more mass loss and macropores generation. As the CO2 concentration increased, the\ncorresponding peak shifted to lower temperature. The kinetic parameters were calculated by Coast-\nRedfern method and agreed with the pyrolysis properties observed. The activation energy and preexponential\nfactor increased (or decreased) simultaneously, illustrating kinetic compensation effect.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zihuan Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiaoqian Ma, Zhongliang Yao, Quanheng Yu, Zhao Wang, Yousheng Lin"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Pyrolysis, Wet sewage sludge, CO2, TG-FTIR, Gaseous product", "Sumber": "Science Direct", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Jan 2019"}
