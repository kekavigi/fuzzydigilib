{"Nomor": 35643, "Judul": "Incorporation of Radicals during Ni(II)-Catalyzed Ethylene Insertion Polymerization", "Abstrak": "A possible involvement of radicals in catalytic insertion chain growth remains elusive, albeit it could account for thus far inconclusive experimental observations and enable yet unachieved synthetic reaction schemes. This work shows that radicals present, deliberately generated for this purpose, are incorporated as end groups in ethylene insertion polymerizations......", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Sonja M.
