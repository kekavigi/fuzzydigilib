{"Nomor": 32934, "Judul": "CO2 Sequestration Through Direct Aqueous Mineral Carbonation Of Red Gypsum", "Abstrak": "In this study, the physical and chemical characteristics and direct aqueous mineral carbonation of red\ngypsum have been investigated. The characterization studies showed that red gypsum is a very potential\nfeedstock for mineral carbonation. It is mainly consisted of CaO, Fe2O3 and SO3 along with some impurities. On the other hand, the carbonation results showed that direct aqueous carbonation of red\ngypsum resulted in CaCO3 and FeCO3 production, however, the carbonates purity and carbonation efficiency are still very low", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "AMIN AZDARPOUR [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mohammad Afkhami Karaei, Hossein Hamidi, Erfan Mohammadian, Bizhan Honarvar"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Red gypsum, Titanium dioxide, Characterization, Direct mineral carbonation, Carbon dioxide sequestration", "Sumber": "Petroleum, 4 (2018) 398-407 - KeAi, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2017.10.002", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Jan 2019"}
