{"Nomor": 32982, "Judul": "QUANTUM AND CLASSICAL PHASES OF THE PYROCHLORE HEISENBERG MODEL WITH COMPETING INTERACTIONS", "Abstrak": "We investigate the quantum Heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice for a generic spin S in the\npresence of nearest-neighbor J1 and second-nearest-neighbor J2 exchange interactions. By employing the\npseudofermion functional renormalization group method, we find, for S \u00bc 1=2 and S \u00bc 1, an extended\nquantum-spin-liquid phase centered around J2 \u00bc 0, which is shown to be robust against the introduction of\nbreathing anisotropy. The effects of temperature, quantum fluctuations, breathing anisotropies, and a J2\ncoupling on the nature of the scattering profile, and the pinch points, in particular, are studied. For the\nmagnetic phases of the J1-J2 model, quantum fluctuations are shown to renormalize phase boundaries\ncompared to the classical model and to modify the ordering wave vectors of spiral magnetic states, while no\nnew magnetic orders are stabilized.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "YASIR IQBAL [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["TOBIAS M\u00dcLLER,", "PRATYAY GHOSH,", "MICHEL J.
