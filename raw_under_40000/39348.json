Firslty, The forward algorithm for three-dimensional magnetic anomalies on a horizontal observation surface is developed with the Block-Toeplitz-Toeplitz-Block (BTTB) matrix. In the proposed algorithm, the\ncuboid elements are used to divide the underground space. And the position of the observation point is set as\nthe projection of the central point of the cuboid element onto the observation surface. With the symmetry\nof the BTTB matrix, the coefficient matrix is compressed and stored to reduces the memory requirements during\nthe computation process. In order to deal with the coefficient matrix and parameter vector computations, the\nmatrix cross-multiplication computation is transformed into a point-multiplication computation with the fast\nFourier transform (FFT) method. Then, to solve the problem of undulating terrain, a hierarchical interpolation\nmethod is proposed in forward algorithm, in which the undulating terrain is divided into several horizontal observation surfaces. Subsequently, the magnetic field on the undulating terrain is interpolated. Some 3D models\nwith horizontal observation surface and undulating terrain are tested to verify the proposed algorithm. The results show that the forward algorithm has the advantages of fast computation speed, high precision, and low\nmemory requirement. It is suitable for large-scale (ten millions of nodes) three-dimensional magnetic forward\nmodeling", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP JIANKE QIANG 1": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/171736"}, "Penulis": "Jianke Qiang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wenyan Zhang, Kai Lu, Longwei Chen, Yuzhen Zhu, Shuanggui Hu, Xiancheng Mao"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Three-dimensional magnetic anomaly modeling Fast and high-precision forward algorithm Hierarchical interpolation method BTTB matrix Undulating terrain", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 166 (2019) 33\u201341, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2019.04.009", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Jun 2019"}
