{"Nomor": 39587, "Judul": "ESTIMATION ALGORITHMS FOR THE DEGREE OF POLYMERIZATION OF PAPER INSULATION IMPREGNATED WITH INHIBITED INSULATION OIL", "Abstrak": "Solid insulation in power transformer deteriorates due to aging processes during\nits operation. The widely used parameter for determining paper insulation condition\nis the Degree of Polymerization (DP). Nowadays DP measurement techniques\nwithout damage the components of the transformer insulation system or interfere\nwith the transformer service time is needed. The most common method is using\nfuran analysis to estimate DP value but still have external factor which impact to\nthe accuracy of furan measurement e.g. oil replacement or reclamation, also\nuncertainties and dynamics factor e. g. different period of measurement after oil\nprocessing, different temperature and time of measurement. Several estimation\nalgorithms has been developed to determine the condition of the solid insulation of\noil-immersed power transformer using the Degree of Polymerization (DP) by\nconsidering chemical and dielectric parameters of un-inhibited oils.\nThis contribution therefore is aimed at develop an algorithm to estimate the DP\nvalue of paper insulation for transformers immersed with inhibited oil. Dielectric\ncharacteristic parameters, i.e. Water content, Acidity, Interfacial Tension (IFT),\nBreakdown Voltage (BDV) as well as Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA), i.e. carbon\nmonoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are processed and evaluated using\nspecialized Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference\nSystem (ANFIS). An algorithm implemented to find the most significant\nparameters to DP value and generate rules for fuzzy sets based on the information\ngain according to entropy of the measurement data. Estimation result observed and\nevaluated so that FIS and ANFIS is suitable to estimate insulation condition for\ninhibited insulation oil. In addition, accelerated aging sample data found suitable to\nuse in algorithms to predict insulation condition on field operating transformer.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK R Bayu Hadi Nugraha": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/172443"}, "Penulis": "R Bayu Hadi Nugraha [23217115]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
