{"Nomor": 37725, "Judul": "A chirp modem incorporating interference excision", "Abstrak": "The paper describes an experimental\n75-baud chirp modem designed to operate at high\nfrequency (HF), which is able to reject interference\nfrom other HF users by adaptive filtering at the\nreceiver. It also has inherently good performance\nin multipath preparation and in white noise, and\nis thus capable of robust digital communication.\nThe system has been tested over a 170 km pointto-\npoint HF skywave link, in which short chirp\nmessages (approximately 30 s duration) were\nalternated in time with frequency-exchange keyed\n(FEK) messages. The total duration of the tests\nwas 72 hours, and included day and night operation.\nIn these tests, the chirp system had an\noverall performance which was superior to that of\nFEK. FEK occasionally suffered from long\nperiods (e.g. 1 hour) of severe failure, essentially\ndue to interference, whereas the chirp modem\nachieved more continuous useful operation.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "E.P.
