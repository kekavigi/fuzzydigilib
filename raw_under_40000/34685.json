{"Nomor": 34685, "Judul": "Low salinity watereSurfactanteCO2 EOR", "Abstrak": "Coreflood, interfacial tension (IFT), contact angle, and phase behavior measurements were performed to investigate the viability of a hybrid of low-salinity water, surfactant, and CO2 flood\nenhanced oil recovery (EOR) process.\nLow-permeability carbonate reservoir cores were aged for eight weeks at reservoir temperature\nand pressure. Coreflood and contact angle between oil droplets and core surface measurements\nwere performed. Additional contact angle measurements on sandstone and shale cores were also\nperformed. The coreflood sequences were seawater flood, followed by low-salinity water flood,\nfollowed by surfactant floods until residual oil saturations to each flooding sequences and finally\nCO2 injection.\nCoreflood in low-permeability carbonate cores show that the hybrid EOR process produces incremental oil up to twenty-five percent beyond seawater flooding. Contact angle measurements on\ncarbonate, sandstone and shale cores indicate that wettability alteration and IFT decrease are the\nmain oil-mobilizing mechanisms in the hybrid EOR process.\nThe hybrid EOR process mobilizes part of the residual oil because: (i) low-salinity brine improves\nwettability towards hydrophilic condition favorable for surfactant flooding; (ii) surfactant in lowsalinity water solubilizes some of the remaining oil as Winsor type II microemulsion and\nlowers IFT between oil and water; and (iii) CO2 will follow surfactant to mobilize more of the\nremaining oil in the wettability-improved condition.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Tadesse Weldu Teklu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Waleed Alameri", "Hossein Kazemi", "Ramona M.
