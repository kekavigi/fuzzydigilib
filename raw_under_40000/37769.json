{"Nomor": 37769, "Judul": "Study of Viability and Seed Structure of Shallot", "Abstrak": "In Indonesia, shallot cultivation finds difficulties to produce high viability seed. That low viability is caused by the\nabnormality of seed\u2019s structure. Normal shallot seeds have seed structure that consists of: testa, endosperm, and embryo. Normal\nembryo has curved shape which it has one cotyledon in endosperm. This research purpose is to find shallot viability and structure that\nis cultivated in tropic area, especially in Indonesia. This research is a deep observation research about water level, seeds viability and\nseeds structure monitoring by using microscope. To make a clearance about seeds structure composition, seeds are mixed with\ntetrazolium salt. Monitoring result shows that seed water level at harvest time is 18%, laid away at one month age is 13%, two\nmonths age is 12% and three months age is 10%. Seed viability at harvest until twenty nine days, seed that is germinated around 8%.\nAt two months viability seed laid age until twenty two days is 36.6%. Meanwhile three months age laid viability test is done with\ngermination boost compounding shows that IAA is able to fasten germination. At IAA treatment viability seeds are 17.25% that is\nfollowed with GA3 treatment around 13%. Another boosting substance that it\u2019s viability is only below 4%. Low viability is also\nproved by the seed structure. The result shows that mostly, the seeds has abnormal structure.", "Daftar File": {"2014_EJ_PP_EDDY_TRIHARYANTO_1-ASLI-1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/166476"}, "Penulis": "Eddy Triharyanto [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Djoko Purnomo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Rekayasa Pertanian", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Ilmu dan Teknologi Hayati", "Subjek": "Garden crops (Horticulture)", "Kata Kunci": "Bawang merah, struktur benih, viabilitas", "Sumber": "Journal of Agricultural Science and Technology B 4 (2014) 121-125", "Staf Input/Edit": "hidayat", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "16 Apr 2019"}
