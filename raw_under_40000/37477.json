{"Nomor": 37477, "Judul": "Landscape, memory and contemporary design", "Abstrak": "Simon Schama in Landscape and Memory says, \u2018Before it can ever be a\nrepose for the senses, landscape is the work of the mind. Its scenery is built up as\nmuch from the strata of memory as from layers of rock\u2019 (1995: 6\u20137).\nLandscape and memory are concepts that are strongly interwoven in the identity of\na place and its inhabitants. For the teaching and practice of landscape architecture,\n\u2018landscape identity\u2019 is regarded as an important issue of special conceptual value.\nThis essay explores the way that landscape, identity of a place and memory interact\nthrough design and design\u2019s visual form. It is divided into two parts. The first explains\nconceptual approaches to landscape as a palimpsest of actions on territory, as a\ndynamic \u2018archive\u2019, and as a tangible link between what we are and what we have\nbecome. The second part is focused on a review of three examples of design from\nprofessional and educational case studies. The rationale for presenting the particular\nprojects is that each one explores the relationship between identity, memory\nand landscape design to address three questions: How can we activate latent\ncharacteristics of a landscape that are connected and refer to past times? How can\ncontemporary landscape design rethink the past and reveal the subtle traces left at\nan historical or archaeological place? How does memory, as a mind process, inflect\nour perception of landscape and influence our interventions and thoughts about it?\nIn order to conceive integrated proposals that are not imposed on or do not alter\nthe site radically, all three projects try to activate the inherent qualities of each place.\nThey propose spaces that host a resilient coexistence of architectural and natural\nelements using subtle gestures and ecology as the main design tools. They are\nlandscape projects that try to awaken, to reveal, to underline by subtraction the\nstrongest elements that form the identity of a place and to achieve these aims within\na biological framework.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Panita Karamanea [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Landscape ; memory ; contemporary design", "Sumber": "https://search.proquest.com/results/7525FC7F2A9741C4PQ/1?accountid=31562", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Mar 2019"}
