{"Nomor": 37454, "Judul": "Bipolar Blue Host Emitter with Unity Quantum Yield Allows FullExciton Radiation in Single-Emissive-Layer Hybrid White OrganicLight-Emitting Diodes", "Abstrak": "Phosphorescence/fluorescence hybrid white organiclight-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are highly appealing for solid-statelighting. One major challenge is how to fully utilize the electricallygenerated excitons for light output. Herein, an efficient strategy torealize full exciton radiation is successfully revealed by a judiciousmolecular design and suitable device engineering. A blue host emitterTP-PPI is designed and synthesized, exhibiting a near 100%photoluminescence quantum yield and a high triplet energy level,enabling high-performance bluefluorescence and sensitization of ayellow phosphorescent dopant. Full exciton radiation in hybrid whiteOLEDs is demonstrated with a single emitting layer formed by doping ayellow phosphor (PO-01) into TP-PPI. Near 100% exciton utilizationand state-of-the-art external quantum efficiency of 27.5% are achieved with the high-efficiency blue-emitting host and anelectron-trap engineered device architecture.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Chen_Co_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164488"}, "Penulis": "Chen Cao 1 [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wen-Cheng Chen,Jia-Xiong Chen,Lei Yang,Xue-Zhi Wang,Hu Yang,Bin Huang,Ze-Lin Zhu,Qing-Xiao Tong,Chun-Sing Lee"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "bipolar bluefluorophore, unity quantum yield, electron trap engineering, hybrid white OLED, full exciton radiation", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
