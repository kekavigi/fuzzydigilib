{"Nomor": 37974, "Judul": "Evaluation Of Polyacrylamide Gels With Accelerator Ammonium Salts For Water Shutoff In Ultralow Temperature Reservoirs: Gelation Performance And Application Recommendations", "Abstrak": "Water shutoff in ultralow temperature reservoirs has received great attention in recent years. In\nprevious study, we reported a phenol-formaldehyde-based gel formula with ammonium salt which\ncan provide a gelation time between 2 hrs and 2 days at 25 C. However, systematic evaluation and\nfield recommendations of this gel formula when encountering complex reservoirs environment are\nnot addressed. In this paper, how and why such practical considerations as water composition,\ntemperature, pH, weight ratio of formaldehyde to resorcinol and contaminant Fe3\u00fe to affect the\ngelation performance are examined. Brookfield DV-III and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are\nemployed respectively for viscosity measurement and microstructure analysis. SEM results further\nillustrate the mechanism of the effect of salinity on gelation performance. It reveals that crosslinking done by covalent bond has great advantage for gel stability under high salinity environment.\nThe target gel formula can provide desirable gelation time below 60 C, perfect for 15e45 C, while\nit is unfeasible to use high salinity to delay gelation at 60 C. We summarized the effect of salinity\non gelation performance of different gel formulas from the present study and published literature.\nThe summarized data can provide important guideline for gel formula design before conducting\nany kinds of experiments. The variation of gelation performance at different salinity may be\ndominated by the interaction between crosslinker-salt-polymer, not only limited to \u201cchargescreening effect\u201d and \u201cion association\u201d proposed by several authors. We hope the analysis\nencouraging further investigations. Some recommendations for field application of this gel are\ngiven in the end of this paper.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "HU JIA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Qiang Ren", "Yong Ming Li", "Xian Ping Ma"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Polymer gel, Ultralow temperatures, Water shutoff, Ammonium salt, Application recommendations", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 2, Pages 90-97 (June  2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Mei 2019"}
