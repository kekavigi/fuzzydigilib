{"Nomor": 34782, "Judul": "The morphological study of spiral/lenticular galaxies in some pairs", "Abstrak": "This work presents the optical observations for three galaxy pairs. We have presented the isophotal contours and\ngeometrical analysis (x-center shift (xc), y-center shift (yc), ellipticity (Ellip=1?b/a) and position angle (P.A.))\nfor each component of the pair. The projected linear separations rp and the relative velocity ?v of each pair have\nbeen determined.\nThis sample of galaxy pairs has been reported by Karachentsev Catalog without interaction signs. Our analysis\nshows that the galaxies had signs of interaction (tidal tail and tidal bridge or only tidal tail). The length and\nthickness of the tidal tails and tidal bridges have obtained and presented in this study.\nOur results show that two of the galaxy pairs are close pairs, i.e. contact systems ( <\n? rp 30 h70 kpc\n1 and\n?v < 200 km/s) with the tidal interaction of tails and bridges. While the other pair is an intermediate pair\n( < <\n? 30 rp 55 h70 kpc\n1 and?v < 5 km/s) with the tidal tail in the western side.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Y.H.M.
