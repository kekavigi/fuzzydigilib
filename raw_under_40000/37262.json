{"Nomor": 37262, "Judul": "Task scheduling for cloud computing using multi-objective hybrid bacteria foraging algorithm", "Abstrak": "Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Cloud services allow individuals and other businesses organization\nto use data that are managed by third parties or another person at remote locations. Most Cloud providers support services under constraints of\nService Level Agreement (SLA) definitions. The SLAs are composed of different quality of service (QoS) rules promised by the provider.\nA cloud environment can be classified into two types: computing clouds and data clouds. In computing cloud, task scheduling plays a vital role\nin maintaining the quality of service and SLA. Efficient task scheduling is one of the major steps for effectively harnessing the potential of cloud\ncomputing. This paper explores the task scheduling algorithm using a hybrid approach, which combines desirable characteristics of two of the\nmost widely used biologically-inspired heuristic algorithms, the genetic algorithms (GAs) and the bacterial foraging (BF) algorithms in the\ncomputing cloud. The main contributions of this article are twofold. First, the scheduling algorithm minimizes the makespan and second; it\nreduces the energy consumption, both economic and ecological perspectives. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed\nalgorithm outperforms than those of other algorithms regarding convergence, stability, and solution diversity.", "Daftar File": {"2019_TA_PP_LASTRI_NAIBAHO_1-ABSTRAK1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164032", "2019_TA_PP_LASTRI_NAIBAHO_1-ABSTRAK11.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164033"}, "Penulis": "Sobhanayak Srichandan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Turuk Ashok Kumar, Sahoo Bibhudatta"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Cloud computing; Resource allocation; Pareto solutions; Bacteria foraging; Genetic algorithms", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "3 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Mar 2019"}
