{"Nomor": 37744, "Judul": "Femtoscopy of stopped protons", "Abstrak": "The longitudinal proton-proton femtoscopy (Hanbury Brown\u2013Twiss) correlation function, based on the idea\nthat in a heavy-ion collision at ? s  20 GeV stopped protons are likely to be separated in configuration space, is evaluated. It shows a characteristic oscillation which appears sufficiently pronounced to be accessible in experiment. The proposed measurement is essential for estimating the baryon density in the central rapidity region and can be also viewed as an (almost) direct verification of the Lorentz contraction of the fast-moving nucleus.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Andrzej Bialas [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Adam Bzdak,", "and Volker Koch"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW C 99, 034906 (2019); Published by the American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Apr 2019"}
