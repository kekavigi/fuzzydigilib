{"Nomor": 34477, "Judul": "Older Women and Craft: Extending Educational Horizons in Considering Wellbeing", "Abstrak": "While the social work literature is broader and more holistic than many disciplines, we\nundoubtedly still limit the knowledge we draw upon in ways that stifle our creativity in\nconceptualising and attempting to facilitate wellbeing, which flows on to limit our\nteaching. In particular, the significance to wellbeing of place and social space, the value of\ninformal networks to generate support and opportunities for reciprocity, and the inherent\ntherapeutic value of creative activity appears to be neglected. In this paper we draw upon a\nsmall Australian research study around older women and craftmaking to explore how\nlearning from diverse disciplines, such as critical gerontology and textile making, can\nilluminate our understanding of wellbeing. We relate this discussion to examining notions\nof ageing that go beyond a focus on illness and deterioration, to enhance positive and\ndiverse concepts of health in the context of everyday life. We then discuss the implications\nfor social work education, with particular emphasis on ageing, and argue that by engaging\nwith a diverse range of disciplines, we are able to think about, teach and advocate for\nwellbeing in more expansive and useful ways.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jane Maidment [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Selma Macfarlane"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Ageing; Arts and Craft; Creativity; Interdependence; Interdisciplinary", "Sumber": "Social Work Education Vol. 30, No. 6, September 2011, pp. 700\u2013711", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Feb 2019"}
