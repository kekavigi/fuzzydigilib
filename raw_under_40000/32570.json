{"Nomor": 32570, "Judul": "The monzonitic to dioritic pluton of Cerro Prieto, Durango, Mexico: A Laramide laccolith inferred by nonlinear 3D inversion of aeromagnetic data", "Abstrak": "The Cerro Prieto pluton is located in the San Juan de Guadalupe municipality, in the eastern limits of the Durango\nState, in northernMexico. Themonzonite\u2013diorite pluton intruded the Upper Cretaceous Caracol Formation, causing\nmetamorphism of shale and sandstone, producing a hornfels aureole surrounding the pluton body, which\nhosts metallic mineral deposits (Au, Ag, Pb, Cu, Zn). We infer that the Cerro Prieto pluton causes the intense\nobserved magnetic anomaly with normal dipolar character, with peak-to-peak-amplitude of about 1000 nT.\nThe 3D nonlinear inverse modeling of this magnetic anomaly revealed a large, normally magnetized source\nbody, with a volume of 625 km3, which fits the data with a residual variance less than 1 nT. The geometry of\nthe model is consistent with a two-stage genesis in which themagma was first emplaced and stopped on a horizontal\nsurface, currently at about 2000mbelowthe surface, and later thickening by lifting the roof and lowering\nthe floor of the magma chamber. The principal dimensions of the pluton correspondwith a triaxial ellipsoid elongated\nalong N25\u00b0E, with axis lengths: L1=20, L2=12.5 and L3=4 km, and this ellipsoid has a volume reduced\nto 523.6 km3, which satisfies the power law L3 = 0.88 [(L1 + L2)/2] 0.55, allowing the classification of the Cerro\nPrieto pluton as a laccolith. Considering the 1D diffusion equation, with a thermal diffusion constant of\n0.6 mm2/s, the time for lowering the temperature of the magma at the time of the intrusion, down to quartz\n?-? transition temperature, lasted about 500,000 years, suggesting that the Cerro Prieto laccolith was emplaced\nat the end of Cretaceous or at the beginning of the Paleocene, then cooled below its Curie temperature, and was\nfully magnetized during the geomagnetic polarity sub Chron C29n or C28n time, between 66 and 63.5 Ma.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Juan Garc\u00eda-Abdeslema  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Thierry Calmus"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "A Laramide laccolith inferred by nonlinear 3D inversion of aeromagnetic data", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 160 (2019) 121\u2013130, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.10.026", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Des 2018"}
