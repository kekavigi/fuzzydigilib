{"Nomor": 38479, "Judul": "Competition of Charge and Energy Transfer Processes in Donor?Acceptor Fluorescence Pairs: Calibrating the Spectroscopic Ruler", "Abstrak": "Sensing strategies utilizing Fo?\nrster resonance\nenergy transfer (FRET) are widely used for probing\nbiological phenomena. FRET sensitivity to the donor?\nacceptor distance makes it ideal for measuring the\nconcentration of a known analyte or determining the\nspatial separation between fluorescent labels in a macromolecular assembly. The difficulty lies in extracting the\nFRET efficiency from the acceptor-induced quenching of\nthe donor emission, which may contain a significant nonFRET contribution. Here, we demonstrate a general\nspectroscopic approach for differentiating between charge\ntransfer and energy transfer (ET) processes in donor?\nacceptor assemblies and apply the developed method for\nunravelling the FRET/non-FRET contributions in cyanine dye?semiconductor quantum dot (QD) constructs. The present\nmethod relies on correlating the amplitude of the acceptor emission to specific changes in the donor excitation profile in\norder to extract ET-only transfer efficiencies. Quenching of the donor emission is then utilized to determine the non-ET\ncomponent, tentatively attributed to the charge transfer. We observe that the latter accounts for 50?99% of donor emission\nquenching in QD-Cy5 and QD-Cy7 systems, stressing the importance of determining the non-FRET efficiency in a\nspectroscopic ruler and other FRET-based sensing applications.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP PAVEL MOROZ 1.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/169766"}, "Penulis": "Pavel Moroz [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zhicheng Jin, Yuya Sugiyama, D\u2019Andree Lara, Natalia Razgoniaeva,Mingrui Yang, Natalia Kholmicheva, Dmitriy Khon, Hedi Mattoussi, Mikhail Zamkov,"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "energy transfer, nanocrystals, FRET, cross-talk, bleed through", "Sumber": "ACS Nano 2018, 12, 5657?5665", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Mei 2019"}
