{"Nomor": 35068, "Judul": "Investigation of structural and electrical properties of ZnO varistor samples doped with different additives", "Abstrak": "Three samples of ZnO doped with CuO as additive were prepared by solid state reaction from the calcined oxides\nand characterized by SEM, EDX, and AFM. The results revealed the presence of intergranular phase. Additives\nfound to be between ZnO grains. The conductivity of the three samples was measured with the frequency up to\n100 KHz by LCR circuit. The calculated coefficients of nonlinearity and the conductivity are shown to be highly\ndependent on the frequency, concentration of copper oxide, surface morphology, and microstructure of the\nvaristor samples. The temperature dependence of the conductivity of these samples will be studied in the future\nwork.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "M.M. Saadeldin [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Osama A.
