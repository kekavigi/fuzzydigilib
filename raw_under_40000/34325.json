{"Nomor": 34325, "Judul": "PERCOLATION AND THE EFFECTIVE STRUCTURE OF COMPLEX NETWORKS", "Abstrak": "Analytical approaches to model the structure of complex networks can be distinguished into two groups\naccording to whether they consider an intensive (e.g., fixed degree sequence and random otherwise) or an extensive (e.g., adjacency matrix) description of the network structure.While extensive approaches\u2014such as the state-of-the-art message passing approximation\u2014typically yield more accurate predictions, intensive approaches provide crucial insights on the role played by any given structural property in the outcome of dynamical processes. Herewe introduce an intensive description that yields almost identical predictions to the ones obtained with the message passing approximation using bond percolation as a benchmark. Our approach distinguishes nodes according to two simple statistics: their degree and their position in the core-periphery organization of the network. Our near-exact predictions highlight how accurately capturing the long-range correlations in network structures allows easy and effective compression of real complex network data.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ANTOINE ALLARD [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["LAURENT H ?EBERT-DUFRESNE"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW X 9, 011023 (2019); Published by the American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Feb 2019"}
