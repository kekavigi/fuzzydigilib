{"Nomor": 33127, "Judul": "Quantum harmonically kicked environments", "Abstrak": "In this work we derive a generalized map which describes the time evolution of a quantum\nsystem coupled to a quantum environment composed by a finite number of free particles kicked harmonically at periodic times. Dissipation is introduced via the interaction\nbetween system and environment, which is switched on and off simultaneously at regular\ntime intervals. The dynamics of the environmental particles occurs along rotated ellipsis in\nphase space and can be described by unrotated harmonic oscillators with a new frequency\nwhich depends on the kicking time. With the definition of a thermal bath we show that our\nquantum kicked environment induces an unusual fluctuation\u2013dissipation relation.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "M.S.
