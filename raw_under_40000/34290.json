{"Nomor": 34290, "Judul": "Automatic passive data selection in time domain for imaging nearsurface surface waves", "Abstrak": "The passive surface wave method, as a valid supplement to the active survey\nmethod for the deeper imaging, has gained growing attentions from geophysicists and\ncivil engineering communities, particularly in urban applications. The multi-channel\nanalysis of passive surface waves (MAPS), as a newly developed method, combines\nseismic interferometry and multi-channel analysis of surface waves and shows high\npotential in extracting high-frequency surface-wave energy in urban environment. The\nunknown source-distribution of ambient noise and the complicated anthropogenic\nenvironment, however, make it difficult to obtain high-quality dispersion images of\npassive surface waves. We proposed a data selection technique in time domain for selective stacking of cross-correlations and applied it to improve the MAPS method.\nThe proposed technique sorts the time segments with the defined acausal-to-causal\nratio factor, and automatically detects the optimum time segments with the highest\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Three real-world applications have demonstrated the\nfeasibility of the proposed data selection technique. The results indicated that our\nmethod is able to preserve the time segments with coherent signals, and reject the\ntime segments polluted by non-stationary noise sources and/or spatial aliasing.\nCompared with the conventional MAPS method, the improved one can broaden\ninterested frequency band of surface waves and deblur the measured image of\ndispersion energy. Finally, we discussed the influence of velocity window parameter\nfor SNR calculation on the performance of the proposed technique, and suggested that\nthe velocity window should be appropriately wide to guarantee the accuracy of\nsurface-wave imaging.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jingyin Pang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Feng Cheng, Chao Shen, Tianyu Dai, Ling Ning, Kai Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Passive surface waves, Data selection, MAPS, Cross-correlations, SNR", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics, S0926-9851(18)30887-5  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.12.018", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Feb 2019"}
