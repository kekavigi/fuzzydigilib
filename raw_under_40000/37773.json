{"Nomor": 37773, "Judul": "Irreversibility in Active Matter Systems: Fluctuation Theorem and Mutual Information", "Abstrak": "We consider a Brownian particle which, in addition to being in contact with a thermal bath, is driven\nby fluctuating forces which stem from active processes in the system, such as self-propulsion or collisions\nwith other active particles. These active fluctuations do not fulfill a fluctuation-dissipation relation and\ntherefore play the role of a nonequilibrium environment, which keeps the system permanently out of\nthermal equilibrium even in the absence of external forces. We investigate how the out-of-equilibrium\ncharacter of the active matter system and the associated irreversibility is reflected in the trajectories of the\nBrownian particle. Specifically, we analyze the log ratio of path probabilities for observing a certain\nparticle trajectory forward in time versus observing its time-reversed twin trajectory. For passive\nBrownian motion, it is well known that this path probability ratio quantifies irreversibility in terms of\nentropy production. For active Brownian motion, we show that in addition to the usual entropy produced\nin the thermal environment, the path probability ratio contains a contribution to irreversibility from\nmutual information \u201cproduction\u201d between the particle trajectory and the history of the nonequilibrium\nenvironment. The resulting irreversibility measure fulfills an integral fluctuation theorem and a secondlaw-\nlike relation. When deriving and discussing these relations, we keep in mind that the active\nfluctuations can occur either due to a suspension of active particles pushing around a passive colloid or\ndue to active self-propulsion of the particle itself; we point out the similarities and differences between\nthese two situations. We obtain explicit expressions for active fluctuations modeled by an Ornstein-\nUhlenbeck process. Finally, we illustrate our general results by analyzing a Brownian particle which is\ntrapped in a static or moving harmonic potential.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lennart Dabelow [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Stefano Bo", "and Ralf Eichhorn"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW X 9, 021009 (2019); Published by the American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "16 Apr 2019"}
