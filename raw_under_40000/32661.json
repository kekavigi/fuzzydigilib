{"Nomor": 32661, "Judul": "Petrophysical characterization of carbonates (SE of Spain) through full wave sonic data", "Abstrak": "Carbonate reservoirs are characterized by strong permeability heterogeneity mainly linked to the predominant\npore type. In thiswork,we present a case study focused on a shallowborehole (160mdepth) located at the eastern\nend of the Betic Cordillera, SE of Spain. This borehole sampled a marly seal (deep marine marls rich in planktonic\norganisms from Messinian \u2013 upper Tortonian) on top of a carbonate reservoir (algae limestone from\nMiocene - upper Tortonian). Laboratory analysis show that most of the samples from the reservoir correspond\nto grainstone and packstone limestone types, and that the quality of this reservoir is controlled mainly by its\ndetritic composition and a high content of bioclasts. The aim of this work is to show the suitability of using standard\ngeophysical logging to assess permeability supported by laboratory and Lugeon tests. Two approaches have\nbeen used based on Kozeny's equation (pseudo-k log) and Mari et al. (2011) work (Ik-Seis log). Both ways require\nobtaining specific surface which is an indicator of pore type. This calculation is based on porosity and Vp/\nVs relations. Porosity has been obtained from resistivity and sonic logs constrained by laboratory measurements.\nShearwave velocity has been inferred from Stoneleywave velocity since this formation is considered as slow(Vs\nlower than 1500 m/s). Pseudo-K and Ik-Seis logs have been scaled using the Lugeon tests results. Both logs reproduce\nthe heterogeneities found in the in-situ test. Finally, an analysis of the dependence of different seismic attributes\nto the specific surface has been performed to check the suitability of using solely sonic measurements\nto assess permeability. This can be useful for boreholes were laboratory or field tests are not available.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Beatriz Benjumea [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ana Isabel L\u00f3pez, Jean Luc Mari, Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds Garc\u00eda-Lob\u00f3n"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Geophysical well logging Full-wave sonic data Permeability Carbonates AFWS permeability indicators", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 160 (2019) 1\u201314, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.10.024", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Des 2018"}
