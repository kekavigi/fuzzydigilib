Maximal biomass yield was 400\u2013500 mg/L at 0.1\u20131% salinity while\nthe TOC, NO3\n?-N, PO4\n3?-P were eliminated 39.5\u201392.1%, 23\u201397.4% and 7\u201330.6%, respectively. The biomass\nyield and pollutants removal efficiencies reduced significantly when salinity rose from 0.1 to 5%. The freshwater\nChlorella vulgaris performed its best with a focus on TOC removal at 0.1% salinity. The marine Chlorella sp. was\nprominent for removing NO3\n?-N at 0.1\u20131% salinity. Through the developed method, the freshwater C. vulgaris\ncompeted to the marine microalgae referring to pollutants assimilation up to 5% salinity. This study unveiled the\nmechanism of salinity\u2019s effect with evidence of salt layer formation and salt accumulation in microalgae.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hoang Nhat Phong Vo [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Huu Hao Ngo.,Wenshan Guo.,Yiwen Liu.,Soon Woong Chang.,Dinh Duc Nguyen.,Phuoc Dan Nguyen., Xuan Thanh Bui.,Jiawei Ren"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Saline wastewater Microalgae Pollutants assimilation Salinity", "Sumber": "Bioresource Technology 275 (2019) 44\u201352", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Feb 2019"}
