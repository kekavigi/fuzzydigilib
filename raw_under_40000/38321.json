{"Nomor": 38321, "Judul": "Magnetophotoluminescence of exciton Rydberg states in monolayer WSe2", "Abstrak": "Monolayer WSe2 hosts a series of exciton Rydberg states denoted by the principal quantum number n = 1, 2,3, etc. While most research focuses on their absorption properties, their optical emission is also important but much less studied. Here we measure the photoluminescence from the 1s\u20135s exciton Rydberg states in ultraclean monolayer WSe2 encapsulated by boron nitride under magnetic fields from ?31 to 31 T. The exciton Rydberg states exhibit similar Zeeman shifts but distinct diamagnetic shifts from each other. From their luminescence spectra, Zeeman shifts, and diamagnetic shifts, we deduce the binding energies, g factors, and radii of the 1s\u20134s exciton states. Our results are consistent with theoretical predictions and results from prior magnetoabsorption experiments.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Erfu Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jeremiah van Baren,", "Takashi Taniguchi,", "Kenji Watanabe,", "Yia-Chung Chang,", "and Chun Hung Lui"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW B 99, 205420 (2019); \u00a92019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Mei 2019"}
