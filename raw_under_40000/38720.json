{"Nomor": 38720, "Judul": "Fabrication of Flexible White Light-Emitting Diodes from Photoluminescent Polymer Materials with Excellent Color Quality", "Abstrak": "This study developed flexible light-emitting diodes\n(LEDs) with warm white and neutral white light. A simple\nultraviolet flip-chip sticking process was adopted for the pumping\nsource and combined with polymer and quantum dot (QD) films\ntechnology to yield white light. The polymer-blended flexible LEDs\nexhibited higher luminous efficiency than the QD-blended flexible\nLEDs. Moreover, the polymer-blended LEDs achieved excellent\ncolor-rendering index (CRI) values (Ra = 96 and R9 = 96), with\nhigh reliability, demonstrating high suitability for special\napplications like accent, down, or retrofit lights in the future. In\nplaces such as a museum, kitchen, or surgery room, its high R9 and\nhigh CRI characteristics can provide high-quality services.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Huang-Yu Lin 1.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170203"}, "Penulis": "Huang-Yu Lin, [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Chin-Wei Sher, Chih-Hao Lin, Hsien-Hao Tu, Xin Yin Chen, Yi-Chun Lai, Chien-Chung Lin, Huang-Ming Chen, Peichen Yu, Hsin-Fei Meng, Gou-Chung Chi,Keiji Honjo, Teng-Ming Chen, Hao-Chung Kuo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "light-emitting diode, polyfluorene, quantum dots, flexible device, color-rendering index", "Sumber": "www.acsami.org", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Jun 2019"}
