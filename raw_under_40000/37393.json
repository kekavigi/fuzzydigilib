{"Nomor": 37393, "Judul": "WHAT IS THE TOURIST LANDSCAPE? ASPECTS AND FEATURES OF THE CONCEPT", "Abstrak": "This paper will present a systematic review of the main publications for landscape and tourism\nresearch in Scopus and polish language databases. These were used to identify papers on landscape and\ntourism published from January 2003 to September 2013. A total of 382 articles and 37 other sources were\nidentified, but 116 analysed. The analysis, focusing on the explicated relation between landscape and tourism,\nshows that it is a new but growing concern for geographers, ecologists, and landscape architects contributing\nto the debate. The result is a veritable smorgasbord of definitions and approaches. The objective of this\npaper is to systematise the current knowledge on tourism and landscape, review the existing definitions\nof the term \u00bbtourist landscape\u00ab, and determine its aspects and components in the context of functions of\nregions. The paper concludes with a tentative definition of a tourist landscape and proposals for further\nscholarly research and some policy advice.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ewa Skowronek [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Andrzej Tucki, Edward Huijbens, Marta J\u00f3?wik"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "sustainable development, literature review, definitions of landscape, landscape structure, features of tourist landscape, tourism space, landscape perception", "Sumber": "DOI: https://doi.org/10.3986/AGS.3311", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Mar 2019"}
