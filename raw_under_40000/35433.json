{"Nomor": 35433, "Judul": "A Bismuth Metal?Organic Framework as a Contrast Agent for X?ray Computed Tomography", "Abstrak": "A new bismuth metal?organic framework (MOF), bismuth-NU-\n901 (Bi-NU-901), featuring the scu topology and a pore with a diameter of ?11 \u00c5,\nwas solvothermally synthesized, and its use as an X-ray computed tomography\n(CT) contrast agent was tested. X-ray CT is a common diagnostic method used in\nthe medical field. Inside the body, contrast media enhance the distinction between\ntissues and organs of similar density. Bi-NU-901 consists of eight connected Bi6\nnodes and tetratopic 1,3,5,8-(p-benzoate)pyrene linkers (TBAPy)....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lee Robison [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Lin Zhang, Riki J.
