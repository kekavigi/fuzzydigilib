{"Nomor": 36172, "Judul": "Cross-Flow Analysis Of Injection Wells In A Multilayered Reservoir", "Abstrak": "During fluid injection into a multilayered reservoir, a different pressure gradient is generated across\nthe face of each permeable layer. This pressure gradient generates driving forces in the wellbore\nduring well shut-in that causes the injected fluid moves from higher pressure layers to lower\npressure layers, a phenomenon known as interwell cross-flow. Cross-flow behavior depends on the\ninitial pressure in the permeable layers and may be referred to as natural cross-flow (identical or\nnatural initial pressures) and forced cross-flow (different initial pressures because of exploitation).\nCross-flow may induce sand production and liquefaction in the higher pressure layers as well as\nformation damage, filter cake build-up and permeability reduction in the lower pressure layers.\nThus, understanding cross-flow during well shut-in is important from a production and reservoir\nengineering perspective, particularly in unconsolidated or poorly consolidated sandstone\nreservoirs.\nNatural and forced cross-flow is modeled for some injection wells in an oil reservoir located at\nNorth Sea. The solution uses a transient implicit finite difference approach for multiple sand layers\nwith different permeabilities separated by impermeable shale layers. Natural and forced cross-flow\nrates for each reservoir layer during shut-in are calculated and compared with different production\nlogging tool (PLT) measurements. It appears that forced cross-flow is usually more prolonged and\nsubject to a higher flow rate when compared with natural cross-flow, and is thus worthy of more\ndetailed analysis.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mohammadreza Jalali  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jean-Michel Embry", "Francesco Sanfilippo", "Frederic J.
