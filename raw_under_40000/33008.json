{"Nomor": 33008, "Judul": "A dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on a dynamic evolutionary environment model", "Abstrak": "diversity of population through different strategies and making the population track the Pareto optimal solution set efficiently after the environmental change. However, these algorithms neglect the role of the dynamic\nenvironment in evolution, leading to the lacking of active guieded search. In this paper, a dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on a dynamic evolutionary environment model is proposed (DEE-DMOEA).\nWhen the environment has not changed, this algorithm makes use of the evolutionary environment to record the\nknowledge and information generated in evolution, and in turn, the knowledge and information guide the search.\nWhen a change is detected, the algorithm helps the population adapt to the new environment through building a\ndynamic evolutionary environment model, which enhances the diversity of the population by the guided method,\nand makes the environment and population evolve simultaneously. In addition, an implementation of the algorithm about the dynamic evolutionary environment model is introduced in this paper. The environment area and\nthe unit area are employed to express the evolutionary environment. Furthermore, the strategies of constraint,\nfacilitation and guidance for the evolution are proposed. Compared with three other state-of-the-art strategies on\na series of test problems with linear or nonlinear correlation between design variables, the algorithm has shown\nits effectiveness for dealing with the dynamic multiobjective problems.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Juan Zou  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Qingya Li.,, Shengxiang Yang.,Jinhua Zheng.,Zhou Peng.,, Tingrui Pei"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Dynamic multiobjective optimization Evolutionary algorithms Evolutionary environment Dynamic evolutionary environment model", "Sumber": "Swarm and Evolutionary Computation 44 (2019) 247\u2013259", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Jan 2019"}
