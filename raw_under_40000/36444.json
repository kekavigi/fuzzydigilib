{"Nomor": 36444, "Judul": "Hyperbranched PEO-Based Hyperstar Solid Polymer Electrolyteswith Simultaneous Improvement of Ion Transport and MechanicalStrength", "Abstrak": "Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-based solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs)with nonflammability, shapeflexibility, and high SPE/Li interfacial stability are poisedto be an enabler for solid-state lithium batteries, but their application is restricted bylow room-temperature ionic conductivity and poor mechanical strength at elevatedtemperatures. Herein, hyperstar polymers are synthesized with hyperbranched PEOserving as the star core and linear polystyrene (PS) serving as the arms. Thehyperbranched topological structure suppresses crystallization and facilitates PEOsegmental motion, and the steric hindrance for PEO segmental motion is tuned bycontrolling the average chain length of the branched PEO segments. The rigid PS armsentangle during phase separation and form mechanically strong physical cross-links. Anall-solid-state Li/LiFePO4battery based on our hyperstar SPE delivers a stable capacityof 142 mAh g?1at 0.2C owing to fast ion transport and stable electrolyte/electrodeinterfaces.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Yang_Chen_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/162225"}, "Penulis": "Yang Chen [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yi Shi, Yanliang Liang, Hui Dong,Fang Hao,Audrey Wang,Yuxiang Zhu,Xiaoli Cui,Yan Yao"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "lithium battery, solid polymer electrolyte, poly(ethylene oxide), hyperstar, hyperbranched, polystyrene, cross-linking", "Sumber": "ACSAppl.EnergyMater.XXXX, XXX, XXX?XXX", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Mar 2019"}
