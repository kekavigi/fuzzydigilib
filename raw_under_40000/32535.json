{"Nomor": 32535, "Judul": "Biometric ontology for semantic biometric-asa-service (BaaS) applications: a border security use case", "Abstrak": "With the fast adoption of cloud computing, the use of biometric technologies has evolved to a different way of\nproviding security, preserving privacy, and analysing personal traits for various purposes. The main components of any\nbiometric system, such as biometric sensing, data gathering, feature extraction, identification, verification, recognition, and\nanalytics, are now handled over distributed networks. Many of the biometric system services are presented over such networks\nwhich are followed by the creation of a new concept \u2018biometric-as-a-service (BaaS)\u2019. Recent BaaS approaches usually focus on\nidentifying the effective distributed architectures, policies, and use case recommendations. However, there is a strong need to\nfocus on developing a semantic framework which should rely on a biometric ontology. This study presents such an ontology\ncovering the uses of different biometric modalities, evaluation and assessment of biometric systems, modelling biometric\nprocesses, and analyses through interlinked relations with biometric stakeholders. In order to shed light on how such an\nontology is useful for BaaS solutions, a case study focusing on the various uses of biometric modalities is presented. The\nselected use case addresses the asylum seeker or immigrant identification problems regarding the border security challenges\nwhere facial biometrics are benefited.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Alper Kanak [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Knowledge", "Kata Kunci": "Biometrics as-a-service", "Sumber": "IET Biom., 2018, Vol. 7 Iss. 6, pp. 510-518", "Staf Input/Edit": "Dany Yunandar", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
