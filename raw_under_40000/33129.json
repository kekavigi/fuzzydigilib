{"Nomor": 33129, "Judul": "Thermal Maturity And Burial History Modelling Of Shale Is Enhanced By Use Of Arrhenius Time-Temperature Index And Memetic Optimizer", "Abstrak": "Thermal maturity indices and modelling based on Arrhenius-equation reaction kinetics have played an\nimportant role in oil and gas exploration and provided petroleum generation insight for many kerogenrich source rocks. Debate continues concerning how best to integrate the Arrhenius equation and which\nactivation energies (E) and frequency factors (A) values to apply. A case is made for the strong theoretical\nbasis and practical advantages of the time-temperature index (PTTIARR) method, first published in 1998,\nusing a single, carefully selected E-A set (E \u00bc 218 kJ/mol (52.1 kcal/mol); A \u00bc 5.45E\u00fe26/my) from the\nwell-established A-E trend for published kerogen kinetics. An updated correlation between PTTIARR and\nvitrinite reflectance (Ro) is provided in which the PTTIARR scale spans some 18 orders of magnitude. The\nmethod is readily calculated in spreadsheets and can be further enhanced by visual basic for application\ncode to provide optimization. Optimization is useful for identifying possible geothermal gradients and\nerosion intervals covering multiple burial intervals that can match calculated thermal maturities with\nmeasured Ro data. A memetic optimizer with firefly and dynamic local search memes is described that\nflexibly conducts exploration and exploitation of the feasible, multi-dimensional, thermal history solution space to find high-performing solutions to complex burial and thermal histories. A complex deep\nburial history example, with several periods of uplift and erosion and fluctuating heat flow is used to\ndemonstrate what can be achieved with the memetic optimizer. By carefully layering in constraints to\nthe models specific insights to episodes in their thermal history can be exposed, leading to better\ncharacterization of the timing of petroleum generation. The objective function found to be most effective\nfor this type of optimization is the mean square error (MSE) of multiple burial intervals for the difference\nbetween calculated and measure Ro. The sensitively-scaled PTTIARR methodology, coupled with the\nmemetic optimizer, is well suited for rapidly conducting basin-wide thermal maturity modelling\ninvolving multiple pseudo-wells to provide thermal maturity analysis at fine degrees of granularity", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "DAVID A.
