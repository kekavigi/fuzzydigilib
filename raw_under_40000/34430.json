{"Nomor": 34430, "Judul": "On Ethics and the Earthquake Resistant Interior Design of Buildings", "Abstrak": "The most common tectonic quality of modern structures, such as frame\nsystems, is their flexibility; they are open for change. Although this characteristic is\na  big  advantage  in comparison  to  the  inflexible  masonry  structures  of  the  past,  it\nmight also create some serious problems, such as e.g. the lack of safety in the event\nof an earthquake, if the flexibility is not used consciously by architects and interior\ndesigners. This  article  attempts to define  and establish  some rules for the  interior\ndesign of buildings with reinforced concrete frame systems. The rules for making\nsubtractions from these structures and extending them by making additions to them\nare contained within this article. The main objective of this article is to derive some\nethical values from these rules. Thus, the conclusion of the article focuses on the\nderivation of some ethical values for achieving earthquake resistant interior design\nof buildings with reinforced concrete frame systems", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yonca Hurol [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Earthquake resistant design  Interior design  Flexibility  Structural engineering  Reinforced concrete frame", "Sumber": "ORIGINAL PAPER On Ethics and the Earthquake Resistant Interior Design of Buildings Yonca Hurol Received: 20 September 2012 / Accepted: 10 December 2012 / Published online: 3 January 2013 \u00d3 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2012", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Feb 2019"}
