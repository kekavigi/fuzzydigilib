{"Nomor": 37724, "Judul": "Convolutionally encoded FFH-MFSK: demodulation and frequency tracking over frequency-varying jammed channels", "Abstrak": "A novel soft decision metric for the\nViterbi demodulation and decoding of convolutionally\nencoded fast-frequency-hopped M-ary frequency\nshift keying is described. The effectiveness\nof two possible hop-by-hop AGe methods is\nevaluated for use with metric calculation methods\nto optimise the worst-case partial-band-jamming\nperformance. The metric is shown to improve the\nworst-case jamming bit-error-rate (BER) performance\nfor M;:' 8 in these situations and to\nalter the worst-case jamming scenario from one of\nsparsely separated tones to either full-band\nA WGN or densely spaced jamming tones. This\nmetric also makes large signal sets (M ;:, 16) more\nattractive for anti-jam M -ary frequency-shift\nkeyed systems. The worst-case partial-band tone\njamming BER performance is consistently close to\nthe broadband A WGN case, irrespective of the\nreceiver bandwidth. This is the reverse with conventional\nlinear metrics. The Viterbi frequencytracking\nmethod is shown to provide fast tracking\nof frequen<.,J' olTsets whilst degrading the BER performance\nof 8-FSK in A WGN or worst-case\npartial-band tone jamming by 0.5 dB for a tracking\nrange of 16 possible carrier-frequency positions.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "J.A.
