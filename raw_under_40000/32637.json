{"Nomor": 32637, "Judul": "Vibration analysis of deploying laminated beams with generalized boundary conditions in hygrothermal environment", "Abstrak": "The free vibration of a deploying laminated beam in hygrothermal environment with a constant axial velocity is studied. The model of this system is given within the framework of the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and von\nKarman nonlinear strain theory. The nonlinear dynamic equilibrium equation with generalized boundary conditions is established based on the Hamilton\u2019s principle with considering the combined effects of the axial\nmotion, transverse vibration and hygrothermal environment. Based on the Galerkin method, a set of ordinary\ndifferential equations is obtained. The numerical results of the discretization equation are performed adopting\nthe eigenvalue method and Newmark method. In addition, the dynamic stability is discussed, and extensive\nnumerical calculations are performed to illustrate the effects of varying extension velocities, temperature, humidity and ply angles on frequencies.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "L.
