{"Nomor": 31228, "Judul": "ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY OF FRESH AND FERMENTED PINEAPPLE JUICE (ANANAS COMOSUS.L) TO BACTERIAL AND FUNGAL INFECTION", "Abstrak": "The study assessed the antimicrobial activity extracted from fresh and fermented pineapple fruit juice \n\n(Ananas comosus.L) on microorganism. The fermented pineapple juice bacteria isolated on MRS agar, \n\ncharacterization test of gram staining, catalase test and microscopic determination carried out. The \n\nresult of gram staining showed 2 colonies on the MRS were gram positive bacteria. The changes of pH \n\nmeasured from day 1 to day 10 showed the pH of pineapple juice was increased from day 1 to day 5 , \n\nwhile decreased from day 6 to day 10 . Day 10 gave the lowest pH which was 3.545. Pineapple juice \n\nshowed positive antimicrobial activities toward bacteria but negative activities toward fungal. This \n\nexperiment to determine the antimicrobial activities of fresh pineapple juice and fermented \n\npineapple juice toward the gastrointestinal infection bacteria which were Pseudomonas aeruginosa \n\nATTC 9027, Staphylococcus aureus ATTC 6538 and Escherichia coli ATTC 8939, and fungi Candida \n\nalbicans ATCC 10231. The pineapple juice was prepared and tested for antimicrobial activity for fresh \n\npineapple juice and fermented juice. The antimicrobial activity tested by Kirby-Bauer test on bacteria \n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, and fungi Candida albicans \n\nobservation after 24 hours \n\nincubation. The positive control for bacteria was tetracycline and fungi was ketoconazole, while \n\nsugar solution used as negative control. The result of the test showed positive antimicrobial activity \n\ntoward the bacteria was increased by day and 10th days had the highest inhibition which \n\nStaphylococcus aureus 11.93mm, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 8.32mm and Escherichia coli 7.90mm. The \n\npineapple juice showed larger inhibition zone in Staphylococcus aureus. There had no antimicrobial \n\nactivity toward fungi, Candida albicans.", "Daftar File": {"2018 TA PP TAN YI JIA 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/140860"}, "Penulis": "TAN YI JIA NIM : 11615761", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["PEMBIMBING Dr. Marlia Singgih Wibowo", "Dr.Elin Julianti"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Farmasi Klinik dan Komunitas", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Farmasi", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Fresh and fermented juice , Pineapple , Antimicrobial activity, Bacteria", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana \u00a0\n                                     yana mulyana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Jun 2018"}
