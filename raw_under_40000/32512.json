{"Nomor": 32512, "Judul": "Bamboo dominance reduces tree regeneration in a disturbed tropical forest", "Abstrak": "Human disturbance may change dominance\nhierarchies of plant communities, and may cause substantial changes in biotic environmental conditions if the new\ndominant species have properties that diVer from the previous dominant species. We examined the eVects of bamboos\n(Bambusa tulda and Cephalostachyum pergracile) and\ntheir litter on the overall woody seedling abundance, species richness and diversity in a mixed deciduous forest in\nnortheastern Thailand. These bamboo species are gaining\ndominance after human disturbance. Our results show that\nseedling abundance and species richness were reduced by\nbamboo canopies. Seedling abundance and species diversity under bamboo canopies were aVected by bamboo litter,\nwhereas seedling abundance and species diversity outside\nbamboo canopies did not respond to the mixed-tree litter\nmanipulation. Removal of bamboo litter increased seedling\nabundance and species diversity. However, bamboo litter\naddition did not aVect seedling abundance or species diversity compared to either control or litter removal. This may\nindicate that the eVect of natural amount of bamboo litter is\nas high as for litter addition in preventing seedling establishment by woody species and hence in minimizing\nresource competition. We conclude that undergrowth bamboos and their litter aVect tree seedling regeneration\ndiVerently from mixed-tree litter, causing changes in plant\ncommunity composition and species diversity. Increased\nhuman disturbance, causing a shift in dominance structure\nof these forests, may result in a concomitant reduction in\ntheir overall woody species abundance, richness and diversity. Thus, management of bamboos by controlling their\ndistribution in areas of high bamboo density can be an\nimportant forest restoration method.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "PANADDA LARPKERN [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["STEIN R.
