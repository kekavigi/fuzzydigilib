{"Nomor": 38199, "Judul": "Tomographic Extraction of the Internuclear Separation Based on Two-Center Interference with Aligned Diatomic Molecules", "Abstrak": "We experimentally investigate the two-dimensional photoelectron momentum spectra of aligned\ndiatomic molecules in an intense laser field. Our results reveal a novel prominent valley structure in\nthe molecular alignment dependence of the high-energy photoelectron spectra along the laser polarization.\nResorting to the molecular strong-field approximation and a simple semiclassical analysis, we show that\nthis valley structure stems from the destructive two-center interference of the laser-driven rescattered\nelectrons in diatomic molecules. Based on this two-center interference with aligned diatomic molecules, we\ndemonstrate for the first time a tomographic method to extract the molecular internuclear separation,\nproviding a more straightforward approach of molecular imaging, in comparison with, e.g., laser-induced\nelectron diffraction and fixed-angle broadband laser-driven electron scattering.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "RenPing Sun [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["XuanYang Lai,", "ShaoGang Yu,", "YanLan Wang,", "SongPo Xu,", "Wei Quan,", "and XiaoJun Liu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 122, 193202 (2019); \u00a9 2019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "16 Mei 2019"}
