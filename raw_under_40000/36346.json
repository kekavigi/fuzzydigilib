{"Nomor": 36346, "Judul": "Facile Surface Properties Engineering of High-Quality Graphene:Toward Advanced Ni-MOF Heterostructures for High-PerformanceSupercapacitor Electrode", "Abstrak": "Metal?organic frameworks (MOFs) have emergedas one class of the most promising electrode materials forsupercapacitors because of their high surface area and tunablepore structures. The development of MOF heterostructures basedon high-quality graphene (HQG) which aims at superiorcapacitive properties while overcoming poor solution process-ability and reactivity of HQG is of great concern. In this work, aheterolayered MOF composite was prepared by a facile glucosemodification of HQG and controlled nucleation and growth oflamellar Ni-MOF on the HQG surface. The introduction ofoxygen-containing functionalities in our approach not onlyimproves the interfacial interactions to form two-dimensionalheterostructures but also enhanced the synergistic effects betweenNi-MOF and HQG substrates. The constructed GM-LEG@Ni-MOF exhibits excellent capacitance of 987.6 F g?1at the current density of 0.5 A g?1and a high capacity retention (85.6%) after3000 cycles, owing to its favorable electrochemical kinetics and highly structural stability.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Yao_Xiao_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/162055"}, "Penulis": "Yao Xiao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wei Wei, Meijiao Zhang,Sa Jiao, Yuchuan Shi, Shujiang Ding"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "graphene, surface engineering, Ni-MOF, supercapacitor, glucose", "Sumber": "ACSAppl.EnergyMater.XXXX, XXX, XXX?XXX", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Mar 2019"}
