{"Nomor": 32458, "Judul": "Set-valued risk statistics with scenario analysis", "Abstrak": "In this paper, we introduce two new classes of risk statistics, named set-valued coherent\nand convex risk statistics. These new risk statistics can be considered as a kind of setvalued\nextension of risk statistics introduced by Kou, Peng and Heyde (2013), and also\nempirical versions of set-valued coherent and convex risk measures introduced by Jouini,\nMeddeb and Touzi (2004) and Hamel (2009), respectively. Representation results for these\nnew introduced risk statistics are provided. Finally, we also provide some examples of setvalued\ncoherent and convex risk statistics.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "YANGHONG CHEN [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yijun Hu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Matematika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Analysis", "Kata Kunci": "Set-valued risk statistics, Convexity, Coherency, Representation results", "Sumber": "Statistics and Probability Letters 131 (2017) 25\u201337", "Staf Input/Edit": "Dwi Ary Fuziastuti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
