{"Nomor": 37396, "Judul": "HIERARCHICAL LANDSCAPE OF HARD DISK GLASSES", "Abstrak": "We numerically analyze the landscape governing the evolution of the vibrational dynamics of hard\ndisk glasses as the density increases towards jamming. We find that the dynamics becomes slow, spatially\ncorrelated, and starts to display aging dynamics across an avoided Gardner transition, with a\nphenomenology that resembles three-dimensional observations. We carefully analyze the behavior of\nsingle glass samples, and find that the emergence of aging dynamics is controlled by the apparition of a\ncomplex organization of the landscape that splits into a remarkable hierarchy of minima as jamming is\napproached. Our results show that the mean-field prediction of a Gardner phase characterized by an\nultrametric structure of the landscape provides a useful description of finite-dimensional systems, even\nwhen the Gardner transition is avoided.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "QINYI LIAO  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["LUDOVIC BERTHIER"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW X 9, 011049 (2019); Published by the American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Mar 2019"}
