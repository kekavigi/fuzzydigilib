{"Nomor": 32547, "Judul": "Zwitterionic cocrystal of diclofenac and L-proline: Structure determination, solubility, kinetics of cocrystallization, and stability study", "Abstrak": "In recent decades, the design of cocrystals has developed significantly due to the unique characteristics and\nadvantages of cocrystals, which help to improve the physicochemical properties of drugs, especially solubility.\nZwitterions are attractive and interesting co-formers. However, the physicochemical properties of cocrystals\nwith zwitterionic co-formers, i.e. zwitterionic cocrystals, have not been adequately evaluated. In this study,\nsolid-state characterization of a newly developed zwitterionic cocrystal of diclofenac (DFA), a non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug, and the amino acidL-proline (PRO) was performed using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, di?erential scanning calorimetry, and powder X-ray di?raction (PXRD) analyses. In addition, the\ncrystal structure of the cocrystal (DFA-PRO) was determined by single-crystal X-ray di?raction analysis, after\nwhich the zwitterionic structure was confirmed. The cocrystallization during co-grinding, which was investigated by PXRD, followed first-order kinetics. Furthermore, the solubility of the zwitterionic cocrystals was\n7.5-times higher than that of the DFA crystals. The results indicate that the cocrystal is stable under ambient\nconditions; however, it hydrates and transforms into a mixture of L-proline monohydrate crystals and DFA\ncrystals under conditions of high humidity.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ILMA NUGRAHANI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dwi Utami", "Slamet Ibrahim", "Yuda Prasetya Nugraha", "Hidehiro Uekusa"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Diclofenac L-Proline Cocrystal Solubility Co-grinding Stability", "Sumber": "European Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences 117 (2018) 168-176", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana \u00a0\n                                     yana mulyana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
