{"Nomor": 38154, "Judul": "Drop impact close to the edge of an inclined substrate: Liquid sheet formation and breakup", "Abstrak": "Raindrop impacts on plant leaves are responsible for the dispersal of several crop\ndiseases. In this experimental study, we propose a generic impact configuration that shares\nseveral qualitative features with more complex impacts on leaves. We investigate the\nformation and breakup of a liquid sheet upon impact of a drop close to the horizontal\nedge of an inclined substrate. The impact Weber number, the distance from the impact\npoint to the edge, and the substrate inclination are systematically varied. We analyze their\ninfluence on the kinematics of both the liquid spreading on substrate and the liquid sheet\nbeyond the edge, as well as on the subsequent statistics of droplet ejection (radius, speed,\nand time of ejection).", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "S.
