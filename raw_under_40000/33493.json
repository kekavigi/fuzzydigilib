{"Nomor": 33493, "Judul": "QUANTUM LIMIT TO SUBDIFFRACTION INCOHERENT OPTICAL IMAGING", "Abstrak": "The application of quantum estimation theory to the problem of imaging two incoherent point sources has\nrecently led to new insights and better measurements for incoherent imaging and spectroscopy. To establish a more general limit beyond the case of two sources, here I evaluate a quantum bound on the Fisher information that can be extracted by any far-field optical measurement about the moments of a subdiffraction object. The bound matches the performance of a spatial-mode-demultiplexing (SPADE) measurement scheme in terms of its scaling with the object size, indicating that SPADE is close to quantum-optimal. Coincidentally, the result is also applicable to the estimation of diffusion parameters with a quantum probe subject to random displacements.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MANKEI TSANG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW A 99, 012305 (2019); \u00a92019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Jan 2019"}
