{"Nomor": 37359, "Judul": "Pedestrian behavior during evacuation from road tunnel in smoke condition\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdEmpirical results", "Abstrak": "Five evacuation experiments were performed in a road tunnel in order to test how pedestrians\nreact when exposed to reduced visibility, how the decision making process is carried\nout, and finally what is the impact of various circumstances like: different level of smokiness,\ncompetitive behavior or learning effect on an evacuation process. In four experiments\npedestrians were exposed to artificial, non-toxic smoke. During evacuation of a group of\npeople gathered in low and moderate level of smokiness (when Cs < 0.5m?1) we observed\nmulti-line patterns created by pedestrians. Decision making was engaged in only by the first\ngroup of passengers, while under heavy smokiness Cs > 0.7m?1 we have observed decision\nmaking by small groups and characteristic double-lines patterns. In four experiments the\nsame group of participants was involved, and a learning effect was observed: increasingly\nshorter pre-movement time and decreasing time required to leave the main tunnel. We\nshow, that movement speed in smoke is influenced by the evacuees\u2019 attitude and familiarity\nwith environment and evacuation procedures and not only by the visibility level.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jakub Porzycki [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Natalia Schmidt-Polonczyk, Jaroslaw Was"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Pedestrian behavior ; evacuation ; road tunnel ; smoke condition ; Empirical results", "Sumber": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0201732 August 29, 2018", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur \u00a0\n                                     Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Mar 2019"}
