{"Nomor": 36358, "Judul": "Modularity and Proportions in Architecture and their Relevance to a Generative Approach to Architectural Design", "Abstrak": "Modularity and proportions have been at stake in\narchitecture since at least the \u00aborders\u00bb in classical antiquity,\nthroughout centuries, and well into our time, as highlighted\nby architects Rudolph M. Schindler, Hans Van der Laan,\nand Le Corbusier. Not all architectural modular and\nproportioning systems are founded on the same assumptions.\nSome systems, which are truly modular, are based on a unit,\nand deal only with integer multiples and dividers of this unit\n(and therefore rational ratios), others imply an irrational\ndivision of a chosen length. While both are based on\nproportions, music and architecture do not relate in the same\nway to space and time. They involve different issues\nregarding physics, perception and dimensions. The generative\napproach to architectural design means the use of\ntransformation rules, which often involve ratios. The use of\ntransformation rules, which relates art to the way nature\ngenerates forms, permits events like \u201chybridization\u201d: how may\nthose operations contribute to a search for \u201cresonance\u201d?", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Marie-Pascale Corcuff [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "modularity, proportion, architectural design, generative design, Le Corbusier, Hans van der Laan, golden number, plastic number", "Sumber": "Nexus Netw J \u2013 Vol.14, No. 1, 2012", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Mar 2019"}
