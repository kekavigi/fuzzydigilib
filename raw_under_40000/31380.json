Hence there is need to develop ecologically safer and economically viable onsite domestic wastewater treatment technologies. Therefore, for the sake of advancement, the present study was carried out to do an investigation on the actualfield application a modified septic tank followed by an anaerobic fixed-bed tank and aerobic fixed-bed with attached growth plastic media for onsite treatment of toilet wastewater. The objective of research are as follows: knowing the performance of modified septic tank in removal of organic matter, determine the efficiency and kinetic removal of COD in each compartment of MST, evaluating the parameter of the growth kinetics of microorganism consortium modified septic tank system in fixed-bed aerobic tank compartment by using batch culture in lab-scale. The characteristics of wastewater used in research is originated from office building toilet. In this research, flow rate was being assumed as one cubic meter per day. Depending on the results obtained from different runs (lab-scale and onsite system), the pilot plant performance was evaluated. The results illustrated the COD removal with respect to the monitoring period (8 months). About 80 to 90% of COD removal was achieved effluent during four months at the hydraulic retention time 74 hours. After that time, the efficiency of COD concentration removal was decreased to about 50 percent. It\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s because of the affect of concentration of influent. For TKN, removal efficiency was achieved only 3.82\uf0b13.84% in the variation of the inlet concentration of 70.15\uf0b122.66 mg/L. Average efficiency achieved in the removal of TP was 15% in the variation of 4.6 mg/L. With these efficiency, modified Stover-Kincannon model was being used to determine the maximum substrate removal rate constant UB and saturated value constant KB in each compartments of MST. Umax and KB values of whole system, Anaerobic and Aerobic compartment resulted 35.587, 28.653 and 84.746 mg/L and 151.819, 424.183 and 951.525 mg/L.day, respectively. Moreover, the maximum specific growth \uf0ecmax and Monod constant Ks was obtained from lab-scale aerobic batch condition. The data from experiment resulted 0.0918/hours of maximum specific growth rate and Monod constant is 64.1506 mg/.", "Daftar File": {"2016 TS PP TRY KIMLENG 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/141296", "2016 TS PP TRY KIMLENG 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/141297", "2016 TS PP TRY KIMLENG 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/141298", "2016 TS PP TRY KIMLENG 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/141299", "2016 TS PP TRY KIMLENG 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/141300", "2016 TS PP TRY KIMLENG 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/141301", "2016 TS PP TRY KIMLENG 1-DAFTAR PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/141302"}, "Penulis": "TRY KIMLENG (NIM: 25314758)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Ir.
