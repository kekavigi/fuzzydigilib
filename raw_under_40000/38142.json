{"Nomor": 38142, "Judul": "What is a walkable place? The walkability debate in urban design", "Abstrak": "What exactly is meant by the term \u2018walkability\u2019? In professional, research and public debates the\nterm is used to refer to several quite different kinds of phenomena. Some discussions focus on environmental\nfeatures or means of making walkable environments, including areas being traversable, compact, physically\nenticing and safe. Others deal with outcomes potentially fostered by such environments, such as making places\nlively, enhancing sustainable transportation options and inducing exercise. Finally some use the term walkability\nas a proxy for better design whether composed of multiple, measurable dimensions or providing a holistic\nsolution to urban problems. This review both problematizes the idea of walkability and proposes a conceptual\nframework distinguishing these definitions. This matters for urban design, because what is considered a walkable\nplace varies substantially between definitions leading to substantially different designs. By mapping the range of\ndefinitions, this review highlights potential conflicts been forms of walkability.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ann Forsyth [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "walkability; pedestrian; vitality", "Sumber": "https://search.proquest.com/docview/1730497087/fulltextPDF/25BD81E6B2904723PQ/3?accountid=31562", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Mei 2019"}
