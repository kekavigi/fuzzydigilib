{"Nomor": 33009, "Judul": "Matrix-specific distribution and compositional profiles of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in multimedia environments", "Abstrak": "This study investigated perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in multimedia environments to confirm the effects of\nemission sources of PFASs and to elucidate their spatial distribution. The highest PFAS levels were detected from\nthe samples of air (272.30 pg/m3\n) and surface water (36.54 ng/L) in an industrial complex area, meanwhile high\nPFAS levels were found from the samples of soil (8.80 ng/g) and sediment (84.98 ng/g) in urban areas and near\nwastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) was primarily detected in water, influent and effluent, whereas long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS)\nwere dominant in dust, soil, sediment and sludge. While PFBS and neutral PFASs were dominant in air, PFCAs\nwere primarily detected in plant and fish. The specific distribution patterns of PFASs in each matrix showed the\ninfluences of surrounding environments and different physicochemical characteristics of each congener. These\nfindings suggest that the industrial complex and WWTP might be major emission sources to air and aquatic\nenvironments, respectively. This is the first study in which 6 neutral and 13 ionic PFASs were investigated\nsimultaneously for nine different matrices in multimedia environments, and also it would be a good model study\nfor future assessment of PFASs.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Sung-Hee Seo [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Min-Hui Son.,, Eun-Su Shin., Sung-Deuk Choi.,Yoon-Seok Chang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "PFAS Multi-media environment Spatial distribution Korea", "Sumber": "Journal of Hazardous Materials 364 (2019) 19\u201327", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Jan 2019"}
