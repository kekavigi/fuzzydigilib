In these studies, targets and distractors are\nusually shown in the same display (e.g., the computer screen).\nHowever, children are constantly exposed to visually enriched\nenvironments (e.g., elementary school classrooms), and little is\nknown about their influence on children\u2019s cognition. Although\nthe importance of the surrounding environment is well recognized\nin the literature, few experimental studies have explored this question. We propose an alternative paradigm to study visual distraction in children that brings together the rigor of experimental\npsychology and more ecological validity on the exposure to potential environmental distractors. Our study was designed to investigate whether a high-load versus low-load visual surrounding\nenvironment influences children\u2019s cognitive performance as evaluated by four different cognitive tasks. A sample of 64 children (aged\n8\u201312 years) completed two sessions in two environmental conditions: a high-load visual surrounding environment and a lowload environment. In each session, they performed visuospatial\nattention and memory tasks. Overall, the results suggested that\nthe high-load visual environment affected children\u2019s cognitive performance given that children performed better in the low-load\nvisual environment (e.g., higher percentage of hits, higher Corsi\nspan).
