{"Nomor": 38337, "Judul": "Ultrafast quantum-path interferometry revealing the generation process of coherent phonons", "Abstrak": "Optical dual-pulse pumping actively creates quantum-mechanical superposition of the electronic and phononic states in a bulk solid. We here made transient reflectivity measurements in an n-GaAs using a pair of relativephase-locked femtosecond pulses and found characteristic interference fringes. This is a result of quantum-path interference peculiar to the dual-pulse excitation as indicated by theoretical calculation. Our observation reveals that the pathway of coherent phonon generation in the n-GaAs is impulsive stimulated Raman scattering at the displaced potential due to the surface-charge field, even though the photon energy lies in the opaque region.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Kazutaka G.
