In this paper,\nin order to study the influence of thermal damage on coal mechanical properties and pore-fracture development,\nuniaxial compression experiments were performed on coal samples treated under different temperatures.\nMeanwhile, the evolution law of coal fracture in the heating process was quantitatively studied from macroscopic and microscopic perspectives by using a CT scanning electron microscope (SEM), and evolution characteristics of coal pore structure under high temperature were tested and analyzed. In addition, the influence\nmechanism of thermal damage to the mine fire was discussed in combination with the characteristics of coal\nmine fire. The results show that the failure mode of coal sample changes from splitting failure to splitting-tensile\ncombined failure and shear-tensile combined failure with the rise of temperature. As the temperature goes up,\nthe number and length of fractures both grow, while the fracture rate and width increase first and then decrease.\nThe porosity of coal exhibits an upward trend on the whole. Under the action of thermal damage, the internal\nmicropore surfaces of coal become notably rougher. The high temperature thermal damage causes the formation\nof a loose area at the edge of fire area. This loose area not only affects the fracture field and airflow field of the\nfire area, but also further induces the fire to spread deeper. The research results can be used as a reference for onsite fire prevention work.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_YONGLIANG_YANG_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164915"}, "Penulis": "Yongliang Yang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Kaiyue Zheng, Zhiwei Li, Zenghua Li, Leilei S, Shisong Hou, Yujian Duan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Coal, Thermal damage, Fracture evolution, Pore structure, Mechanical parameters", "Sumber": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrmms.2019.03.004", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Apr 2019"}
