{"Nomor": 37173, "Judul": "A ROCK PHYSICS MODELING AND FLUID SUBSTITUTION STUDIES IN SAND STONE RESERVOIR AND SHALYSAND", "Abstrak": "The link between various physics properties, including cement volume, clay volume and degree of sorting, can be used to perform lithology substitution from observed rock types assumed to be present nearby. Rock physics models can be used to provide the link between trends in velocity and porosity as well as velocity and clay content in reservoir rocks.\nThe main objective of this thesis are to discover sandstone and shalysand area from x formation. And be understanding the step to process the clean sand and shalysand to compare how well the predicted response of fluid substitution methods using Gassmann\u2019s equation applied to rock physics models.\nThe data used in modeling is based on physical parameter data from (Papua that own by Oil Company Z).\nthe Dvorkin-Gutierrez laminar model which was the basis of Simm porosity modeling. Laminar shows a description of the mixture of small grains and large grains that are layered used laminar thought to be Simm (2007) type. Several types of modeling are used to determine other elastic parameters such as P wave velocity and S wave velocity, among others are effective elastic medium (lower limit of Hashin-Shtrikman and upper limit of krief modeling)\nThe model was established for water-saturated rock and gas saturated which is Gassmann theory as a tool for predicting pore fluid from the elastic properties of water-saturated sandstone reservoir and shalysand.\nIn VP the brine sat will have higher value than the Gas sat. because in vp there is bulk modulus parameter while in vs inversely depends on density. In Hertz-Mindlin the difference Vp brine and Vp gas is much higher than in Krief, so Hertz-Mindlin will tend to optimistic and Krief will tend to pessimistic and in Hertz-Mindlin the difference Vs gas and Vs brine is much higher than in Krief, so Hertz-Mindlin will tend to optimistic and Krief will tend to pessimistic.", "Daftar File": {"2019_TA_PP_ALI_GAMAL_AMER_SALEH_AL-HAMIDI_1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/163834"}, "Penulis": "Ali Gamal Amer Saleh Al-hamidi [12313701]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ignatius Sonny Winardhie, Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Geofisika - FTTM", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "rock physics modeling, sandstone, shalysand, Clay content, good Reservoir, Dvorkin-Gutierrez modeling.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "9 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Mar 2019"}
