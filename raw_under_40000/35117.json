{"Nomor": 35117, "Judul": "Influence of paper mill wastewater on reed chlorophyll content and biomass", "Abstrak": "Studies on the influence of paper mill wastewater, which affects photosynthesis, on reed chlorophyll and biomass can provide a theoretical basis for the ecological restoration of wetland plants. The influence of different\nconcentrations of wastewater (chemical oxygen demands (COD) of 300, 175 and 50 mg\u2022L?1\n) and different irrigation times (germination, blade-expansion, rapid-growth, heading and maturity stages) on the contents of\nchlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll and chlorophyll a/b in reeds were tested in experimental pools\nthat simulated the wetland ecosystem of the Liaoning Shuangtai estuary. The contents of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll and chlorophyll a/b all increased significantly with increasing concentrations of\nwastewater, and their contents all differed significantly from each other. The contents of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll were maximal when irrigated at the beginning of all growth stages with COD of\n300 mg\u2022L?1\n(C1O) at 2.253, 0.458 and 2.711 mg\u2022g?1 fresh weight (FW), respectively, with irrigation at the rapidgrowth stage and were minimal in the control plants at 0.142, 0.068 and 0.210 mg\u2022g?1 FW, respectively, with\nirrigation at maturity. Chlorophyll a/b was maximal at C1O at 5.753 with irrigation at germination stage and\nwas minimal in the control plants at 2.113 with irrigation at maturity. Reed biomass was maximal at C1O at\n3.26 kg, which was 2.76 times higher than the control. Reed biomass was positively correlated with the content\nof chlorophyll and with COD in the wastewater. Paper mill wastewater generally increased the content of\nchlorophyll and the net photosynthesis rate and enhanced the growth of reeds.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Fangli Su [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Linlin Dong.,Haifu Li.,Tieliang Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Paper mill wastewater Reed Chlorophyll Biomass Wetland", "Sumber": "Physics and Chemistry of the Earth 108 (2018) 13\u201318", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Feb 2019"}
