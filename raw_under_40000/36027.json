{"Nomor": 36027, "Judul": "CHIRAL CASIMIR FORCES: REPULSIVE, ENHANCED, TUNABLE", "Abstrak": "Both theoretical interest and practical significance attach to the sign and strength of Casimir forces. A famous, discouraging no-go theorem states that \u201cthe Casimir force between two bodies with reflection symmetry is always attractive.\u201d Here, we identify a promising way to avoid the assumptions of the no-go theorem, and propose a universal way to realize repulsive Casimir forces. We show that the sign and strength of Casimir forces can be adjusted by inserting optically active or gyrotropic media between bodies, and modulated by external fields.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "QING-DONG JIANG AND FRANK WILCZEK [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW B 99, 125403 (2019); \u00a92019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Mar 2019"}
