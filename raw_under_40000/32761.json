{"Nomor": 32761, "Judul": "SPACE CHARGE IMPEDANCE AND ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS IN ELLIPTICAL VACUUM CHAMBERS", "Abstrak": "Starting from the electric fields produced by a point charge and a dipole traveling inside a circular\nvacuum chamber, in this paper we derive a formalism for a complete set of equations that describe the\nelectromagnetic fields and the longitudinal and transverse coupling impedances arising by the interaction\nof a beam with a perfectly conducting pipe in the case of elliptic geometry. The expressions, which are\nvalid for any frequency and beam energy, are written in terms of expansions of Mathieu functions, allow\nto range from a circular geometry to the parallel plates, and show an interesting parallelism with the\nwell-known expressions for a circular pipe. We also obtain that, under the approximation of low\nfrequency, the formalism allows us to derive the Laslett coefficients for parallel plates, circular and\nelliptic beam pipe.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "M.
