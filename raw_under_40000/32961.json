{"Nomor": 32961, "Judul": "Associations between the physical environment and park-based physical activity: A systematic review", "Abstrak": "Background: With an increase in the evidence for the associations between park-based physical activity (PA) and physical environments (especially park and neighborhood environments), researchers face an important challenge in interpreting and summarizing the evidence to develop\nenvironmental change interventions. An updated review is needed to better inform policymaking and environmental interventions. The current\nstudy aimed to systematically review the research on the associations of park-based PA with park and neighborhood environmental\ncharacteristics.\nMethods: We targeted English peer-reviewed articles from 5 electronic databases using keywords related to park-based PA, park environments,\nand neighborhood environments. Of the 4071 identified papers, 25 studies published between 2008 and 2016 met all the eligibility criteria and\nwere included in this review.\nResults: The characteristics of physical environment that received consistent support included paths/trails, lighting, and incivilities (e.g., broken\nglasses and litter). Mixed findings were revealed for 6 park environmental factors (unspecified active facilities, playgrounds and skating areas, fitness stations, picnic areas, greenness, and park size) and 2 neighborhood environmental factors (park density and park proximity).\nConclusion: It can be concluded that paths/trails, lighting, and incivilities are 3 key physical environmental attributes of park-based PA. Given\nthe inconsistent findings on park and neighborhood environmental factors, more robust designs such as prospective investigation are required.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ru Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hagen Wulff.,Yanping Duan.,Petra Wagner"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Neighborhood; Park-based physical activity; Park environment; Physical environment; Systematic review", "Sumber": "Journal of Sport and Health Science xxx (2018) xxx-xxx", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Jan 2019"}
