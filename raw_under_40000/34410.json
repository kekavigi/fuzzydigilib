{"Nomor": 34410, "Judul": "COLLOQUIUM:SUPERHEAVY ELEMENTS: OGANESSON AND BEYOND", "Abstrak": "During the last decade, six new superheavy elements were added into the seventh period of the periodic\ntable, with the approval of their names and symbols. This milestone was followed by proclaiming 2019\nthe International Year of the Periodic Table of Chemical Elements by the United Nations General\nAssembly. According to theory, due to their large atomic numbers, the new arrivals are expected to be\nqualitatively and quantitatively different from lighter species. The questions pertaining to superheavy\natoms and nuclei are in the forefront of research in nuclear and atomic physics and chemistry.\nThis Colloquium offers a broad perspective on the field and outlines future challenges.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "S.A .
