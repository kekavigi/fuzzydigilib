{"Nomor": 32404, "Judul": "Ultrafast Formation of a Fermi-Dirac Distributed Electron Gas", "Abstrak": "Time- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy with 13 fs temporal resolution is used to follow\nthe different stages in the formation of a Fermi-Dirac distributed electron gas in graphite after absorption of\nan intense 7 fs laser pulse. Within the first 50 fs after excitation, a sequence of time frames is resolved that\nare characterized by different energy and momentum exchange processes among the involved photonic,\nelectronic, and phononic degrees of freedom. The results reveal experimentally the complexity of the\ntransition from a nascent nonthermal towards a thermal electron distribution due to the different timescales\nassociated with the involved interaction processes.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "G.
