{"Nomor": 33003, "Judul": "A Review Of Multiscale Expansion Of Low Permeability Reservoir Cracks", "Abstrak": "The study of rock crack propagation by multi-scale method is of great significance to comprehensively\nand accurately understand the law of rock crack evolution. In this paper, the theoretical, experimental\nand numerical methods from macroscale, mesoscale and microscale used for crack propagation in recent\nyears are summarized and analyzed. Firstly, the evolution mechanism of the crack and the related\nresearch status are analyzed from a single scale. Secondly, multi-scale theory, modeling, meshing algorithm and macro-mesoscopic parameters are reviewed in the multi-scale coupling method. Through\nthe analysis of the results published in recent years, it is considered that the following aspects need to be\nfurther studied: the characteristic parameters of the rock are different at different scales, so the\nextraction of the characteristic parameters under different scales is essential to modeling and coupling;\nthe heterogeneity of rock and the prefabrication of cracks are greatly affected by human factors, so that\n3D printing will be a good breakthrough to build the model of crack owing to its accurate control on the\ndistribution and the size of cracks. The internal stress field of the rock is complex and varied, and the\ngeneration and expansion of the microcracks in the process of crack propagation are closely related to\nthe surrounding environment. Therefore, it is of great importance to combine theoretical, experimental\nand numerical research with practical engineering.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "LIUKE HUANG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jianjun Liu, Youjun Ji, Xiaoping Gong, Liangkai Qin"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Crack propagation, Multiscale coupling, Multiscale modeling, Microcrack 3D printing", "Sumber": "Petroleum 4 (2018) 115e125 - KeAi, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2017.09.002", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Jan 2019"}
