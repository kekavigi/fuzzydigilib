{"Nomor": 37837, "Judul": "ANALYTICAL SOLUTIONS FORA ONE-DIMENSIONAL CHEMO-MECHANICAL COUPLING PROBLEM", "Abstrak": "Chemo-mechanical coupling exists in a lot of intelligent materials including hydrogels,\nbiological tissues and other soft materials. These materials are able to respond to external\nstimulus, such as temperature, chemical concentration, and pH value. In this paper, a\none-dimensional theoretical model for chemo-mechanical coupling is proposed for analyzing the\nuniaxial stress/strain state of coupling materials. Based on the chemo-mechanical coupled governing\nequation, the displacement function and concentration function are derived and the stress\nand chemical potential are obtained. It is shown that the present chemo-mechanical theory can\ncharacterize the chemo-mechanical coupling behavior of intelligent materials.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Qingsheng Yang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hui Tian, Qinghua Qin"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "intelligent materials, chemo-mechanical coupling, analytical solution, theoretical model, constitutive equations, hydrogel", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect: Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 27, No. 2, April, 2014", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Apr 2019"}
