{"Nomor": 37447, "Judul": "Friction-Based Connectors for Timber Shear Walls: Static Experimental Tests", "Abstrak": "Timber shear wall systems dissipate energy through nail bending, nail withdrawal, and crushing of the sheathing around the nail\nhole. This dissipation mechanism is a pinching hysteretic response. Use of high-damping devices is an effective method for improving the\nearthquake resistance of a building. In this study, three wood friction connections were developed and tested to increase the damping of the\nwood shear walls. In this paper, cyclic experimental tests of the connectors and shear walls are presented. In addition, results of long-term performance assessments are also presented. The cyclic test response of the connections exhibited a rectangular hysteretic response, and the shear\nwall systems had an equivalent viscous damping ratio of around 0.3.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP YOSHIAKI WAKASHIMA 1": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164469", "2019 EJRNL PP YOSHIAKI WAKASHIMA 2": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164470"}, "Penulis": "Yoshiaki Wakashima [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hidemaru Shimizu , Koichiro Ishikawa,  Yasushi Fujisawa and Solomon Tesfamariam"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Shake table test, Timber structures, Dampers, Energy dissipation", "Sumber": "Journal of Architectural Engineering / Volume 25 Issue 2 - June 2019", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Mar 2019"}
