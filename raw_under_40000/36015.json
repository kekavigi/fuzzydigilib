{"Nomor": 36015, "Judul": "Hyaluronic Acid-Coated Aligned Nanofibers for the Promotion ofGlioblastoma Migration", "Abstrak": "The propensity of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells to migrate along white matter tracts and blood vesselssuggests that topographical cues associated with brain parenchyma greatly influence GBM motility and invasion.In vitrocellculture platforms that mimic the physical and biochemical characteristics of brain tissue are needed to develop biologicallyrelevant GBM migration models for the development of anticancer therapies. Here, we fabricated highly aligned chitosan-polycaprolactone (C-PCL) polyblend nanofibers coated with hyaluronic acid (HA), a glycosaminoglycan commonly found inthe brain, to simulate the structure and biochemistry of native brain tissue. The influence of topography on GBM cell behaviorwas apparent on both HA-coated and uncoated nanofibers where cells aligned axially along nanofibers and displayed anelongated morphology associated with migration. Time lapse imaging revealed that migrating cells on nanofibers were less likelyto divide, suggesting a shift to a mesenchymal-like phenotype. Cells cultured on nanofibers coated with 0.5% HA achieved thehighest migratory speed relative to uncoated nanofibers and 2D adherent cultures on polystyrene plates. Further, cells onnanofibers were more resistant to cell death, after exposure to the common chemotherapeutic Temozolomide than cells grownon 2D polystyrene plates. These results indicate that HA-coated nanofibers are a promising substrate for characterization ofGBM migration and investigation of novel therapies.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Ariane_Erickson_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/161407"}, "Penulis": "Ariane Erickson [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jialu Sun,Sheeny K.
