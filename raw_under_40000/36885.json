{"Nomor": 36885, "Judul": "SPATIO-TEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF MODIS VEGETATION INDICES FOR MANGROVE DEFORESTATION IN SOUTHEAST ASIA", "Abstrak": "The mangrove forests of Southeast Asia are highly biodiverse ecosystems and provide multiple ecosystem services and support coastal livelihoods. Despite all the benefits of mangrove forests, these forests are also among the most vulnerable ecosystems, both to natural and anthropogenic disturbance. The previous studies have mapped and quantified the anthropogenic factors of mangrove forests deforestation in Southeast Asia from 2000 to 2012. In order of the deforestation monitoring, a quick assessment of the deforestation driver was needed. The satellite-derived vegetation indices from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provided an opportunity to be explored as an alternative approach in the correlation between vegetation indices responds to the conversion mangrove over 2000-2012. This study aims to analyze the spatiotemporal trends of the vegetation indices related to the conversion type. In the initial step, the vegetation indices of MODIS data were calculated and clipped to the area of the mangrove in 2000 and 2012. The information of deforestation rate and drivers were added to the attribute of each index. The final step, the indices were analysed and plotted. The results showed that indices were highly dependent on land cover and land use conversion. Site, where the mangrove restored, showed no significant changes of indices from 2000 to 2012. Sites converted by relatively to non-vegetated land cover and land use had decreased by the indices. Sites converted another vegetation land cover relatively by, and land use had a vary of the indices trends. In the rice field the indices have a fluctuation every year and in the oil palm plantation the indices showed high value. The examination of these indices verifies needing to use this tool (vegetation indices) along with other monitoring data to identify areas with deforestation problem (where, when, and what conversion arise) to formulate practical management decisions.", "Daftar File": {"2019_TA_PP_Yoki_1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/163133"}, "Penulis": "Yoki Sepwanto Raja Gukguk [15114099]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
