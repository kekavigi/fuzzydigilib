{"Nomor": 38068, "Judul": "Studying the correlation of rock properties with P-wave velocity index in dry and saturated conditions", "Abstrak": "Estimation of physical and mechanical properties of rocks plays crucial role in designing of mining and civil\nengineering projects. Determination of these properties using direct methods i.e., laboratory determination is very\nexpensive and time consuming in most cases despite having the high accuracy. Moreover, preparing core samples to\nperform direct tests is extremely difficult and needs double precision. For this reason, indirect and non-destructive\nmethods can be utilized as suitable alternatives to determine rock properties. In this paper, the relationships between\nthe different physico-mechanical properties of intact rocks with P-wave velocity have been investigated. For this\npurpose, rock samples of schist, phyllite, and sandstone were firstly collected from drilling operation in Marivan\nAzad dam site of Iran. Then, different physio-mechanical properties of core samples including uniaxial compressive\nstrength, modulus of elasticity, porosity, Poiss on\u2019s ratio, slake durability index, density, water absorption and Pwave velocity were determined in dry and saturated conditions in the laboratory. Based on the statistical analysis,\nlinear, logarithmic, polynomial, exponential and power equations between the above parameters and P-wave\nvelocity were investigated. An equation with very high determination coefficient (R2) was proposed as best equation\nto determine each of the above properties based on the P-wave velocity index. To validate the proposed empirical\nequations, obtained results were compared with the measured data which was not incorporated in equations\ndevelopment. Finally, comparison from the obtained results showed that physical and mechanical properties of rock\nhave higher correlation with the P-wave velocity in saturated and dry conditions, respectively.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mohammad Rezaei [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pouya Koureh Davoodi, Iraj Najmoddin"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Intact rock; Physico-mechanical properties; P-wave velocity; Azad dam; Statistical analysis", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics, S0926-9851(17)31025-X, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2019.04.017", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Mei 2019"}
