{"Nomor": 35229, "Judul": "IN-PLANE FERROELECTRIC TUNNEL JUNCTION", "Abstrak": "Ferroelectric materals are an important platform for the realization of nonvolatile memories. So far,\nexisting ferroelectric memory devices have utilized out-of-plane polarization in ferroelectric thin films.\nIn this paper, we propose a type of random-access memory (RAM) based on ferroelectric thin films with\nin-plane polarization, called an \u201cin-plane ferroelectric tunnel junction.\u201d Apart from nonvolatility, lower\npower usage, and a faster writing operation compared with traditional dynamic RAMs, our proposal\nhas the advantage of a faster reading operation and a nondestructive reading process, thus overcoming\nthe write-after-read problem that exists widely in current ferroelectric RAMs. The recent discovered\nroom-temperature ferroelectric IV-VI semiconductor thin films are a promising material platform for the\nrealization of our proposal", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "HUITAO SHEN [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["JUNWEI LIU,", "KAI CHANG,", "AND LIANG FU"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED 11, 024048 (2019); \u00a9 2019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Feb 2019"}
