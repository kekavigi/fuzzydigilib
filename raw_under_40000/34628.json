Thirteen out of the fifty-six antimicrobial compounds analyzed were\ndetected in the wastewater samples with concentration ranging from 23.30 (for cefalexin) to 690.50 ng/L (for\nspiramycin) in WWTP influent and from 7.50 (for cefalexin) to 370.04 ng/L (for spiramycin) in WWTP effluent.\nThe highest removal efficiency was observed for trimethoprim (88%), while the lowest one was observed for\nsulfapyridine (33%).The potential impact of the regenerated waters in the environment and pubic health is also\ndiscussed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Malek Harrabi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Saulo Varela Della Giustina., Fatma Aloulou., Sara Rodriguez-Mozaz.,Dami\u00e0 Barcel\u00f3.,c , Boubaker Elleuch"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Antibiotics Environment pollution WWTP Wastewater Water reuse", "Sumber": "Environmental Nanotechnology, Monitoring & Management 10 (2018) 163\u2013170", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Feb 2019"}
