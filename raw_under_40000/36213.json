{"Nomor": 36213, "Judul": "Shale Characteristics Impact On Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Fluid Typing Methods And Correlations", "Abstrak": "The development of shale reservoirs has brought a paradigm shift in the worldwide energy\nequation. This entails developing robust techniques to properly evaluate and unlock the potential of\nthose reservoirs. The application of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance techniques in fluid typing and\nproperties estimation is well-developed in conventional reservoirs. However, Shale reservoirs\ncharacteristics like pore size, organic matter, clay content, wettability, adsorption, and mineralogy\nwould limit the applicability of the used interpretation methods and correlation. Some of these\nlimitations include the inapplicability of the controlling equations that were derived assuming fast\nrelaxation regime, the overlap of different fluids peaks and the lack of robust correlation to estimate\nfluid properties in shale. This study presents a state-of-the-art review of the main contributions\npresented on fluid typing methods and correlations in both experimental and theoretical side. The\nstudy involves Dual Tw, Dual Te, and doping agent's application, T1-T2, D-T2 and T2sec vs. T1/T2\nmethods. In addition, fluid properties estimation such as density, viscosity and the gas-oil ratio is\ndiscussed. This study investigates the applicability of these methods along with a study of the\ncurrent fluid properties correlations and their limitations. Moreover, it recommends the appropriate method and correlation which are capable of tackling shale heterogeneity.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mohamed Mehana  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ilham El-monier"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Shale, Fluid typing, Fluid properties, Heterogeneity, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 2, Pages 138-147 (June  2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Mar 2019"}
