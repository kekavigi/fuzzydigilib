The experimental success of such application and its experimental\nuncertainties are today reported in many publications. To map bedrock, two approaches exist. The first is to\nassume a constant shear wave velocity profile of the sediments. The second, and most preferable, is Ibs-von\nSeht and Wohlenberg's, based on correlating Nakamura's curves main peak and wells information. In the latter\napproach, the main sources of uncertainty addressed by authors, despite the lack of formal proof, comprise\nlocal deviations of the subsurface from the assumed model. I first discuss the reliability of the simplified constant\nvelocity approach showing its limitations. As a second task, I evaluate the uncertainty of the Ibs-von Seht\nand Wohlenberg's approach with focus on local subsurface variations. Since the experimental basis is\nwell established, I entirely focus my investigation on numerical simulations to evaluate to what extent local\nsubsurface deviations from the assumed model may affect the outcome of a bedrock mapping survey. Further,\nthe present investigation strategy suggests that modeling and inversion, through the investigation of the\nparameters space around the reference model, may reveal a very convenient tool when lateral variations are\nsuspected to exist or when the number of available wells is not sufficient to obtain an accurate frequencydepth regression", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Samuel Bignardi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Microtremor HVSR Bedrock mapping Lateral variations Uncertainty", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 145 (2017) 28\u201338, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.07.017", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Mar 2019"}
