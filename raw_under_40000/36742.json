{"Nomor": 36742, "Judul": "Sewage sludge processing and management in small and medium-sized municipal wastewater treatment plant-new technical solution", "Abstrak": "Although sewage sludge generated by most large wastewater treatment plants is treated as waste, this \u2018waste\u2019 is\nboth a source of energy and nutrients. Moreover, mainly in the small and medium-sized installations of municipal wastewater treatment plants is produced sewage sludge that meets the standards for soil application.\nUnfortunately, the overly simplified operating systems of small wastewater treatments plants cannot provide the\nsatisfactory content of water in sewage sludge for energy recovery purposes. Therefore, new solutions for sewage\nsludge treatment are required. The study presents an innovative, energy effective, wastewater treatment and\nsewage sludge processing in one operational sequence, with significant energy consumption decrease and autothermal biomass production. Current research contains detailed technical information about the novel integrated waste water treatment plant and sewage sludge treatment installation as well as cost analysis in\ncomparison to conventional treatments.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the operation of the one prototype line for wastewater and sewage\nsludge treatment and the assessment of the obtained biomass and fertilizer.\nThis new technology is a solution for small and medium-sized municipal wastewater treatment plants and is\nleading to change the conception of wastewater treatment process as a whole and is resolving the management of\nsewage sludge at the place where it is generated. In described process the sewage sludge is adequately treated by\nthe installation apparatus and can be used in two ways: as a source of pathogen-free compost, or as a biomass\nand feedstock for simple thermal installation. Obtained sewage sludge can be recycled as biomass for combustion\nwith the remaining ash acing as a plant nutrient-rich source (soil properties enhancer). Finally, in a modified\nwastewater treatment process, an odorless and stabilized compost or biomass for thermal energy recovery can be\nobtained and utilized directly at the place of origin. This alternative system allows for the systematic (and\ntechnological) adjustment of already existing, upgraded and newly-designed wastewater treatment plants. This\nnew and innovative technology driven by assumptions about the best possible use of the resources and energy,\nallows for a more sustainable functioning of the treatment plant. The present study provides a significant insight\ninto closing carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and energy loops in wastewater treatments system.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Anna Grobelak [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Anna Grosser., Ma?gorzata Kacprzak.,Tomasz Kamizela"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Sewage sludge disposal Small wastewater treatment plants Compost Biomass Renewable energy", "Sumber": "Journal of Environmental Management 234 (2019) 90\u201396", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Mar 2019"}
