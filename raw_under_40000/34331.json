Seventy-seven P-12 art teachers responded to an online\nsurvey items consisting of perceived knowledge and preparedness and strategies and\nresources, including assistive technology, used in the art classroom. Results showed\nthat (a) neither years of teaching experience nor number of students with disabilities\ntaught were related to frequency of use of assistive technology; (b) respondents agreed/\nstrongly agreed that it is important for students with significant disabilities to participate\nin artmaking (96 %); (c) in response to a list of assistive technology devices, over half\nreported using most of them rarely or never. Those most commonly reported were\nlarge-handled writing or painting tools, adapted scissors, and devices for stabilization;\nand (d) one-fourth of the respondents reported never working collaboratively with a\nspecial education teacher and most reported collaboration happens only sometimes.\nFindings suggest the need for more preservice and inservice preparation for art teachers\nto most effectively engage students with significant disabilities as well as more\npreparation for special education teachers and paraeducators in both collaboration\nand specific assistive technology expertise.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mari Beth Coleman  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["E.
