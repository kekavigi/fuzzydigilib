{"Nomor": 35511, "Judul": "Constructed wetlands combined with disinfection systems for removal of urban wastewater contaminants", "Abstrak": "The removal efficiency of an urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) to obtain an effluent suitable for agriculture reuse was evaluated in a one-year period, taking into account the Italian wastewater limits and the recent\nEuropean proposal for the minimum requirements water quality for agricultural irrigation. The secondary effluent of WWTP was treated by three full-scale horizontal sub-surface flow (H-SSF) constructed wetlands (CWs),\nworking in parallel, planted with different macrophytes species, and combined with a UV device and a lagooning\nsystem running in series.\nThe H-SSF CW system effectively reduced physico-chemical pollutants and its efficiency was steady over the investigation period, while, Escherichia coli densities always exceed the Italian limits required for wastewater reuse\nin agriculture. The UV system significantly reduced the microbiological indicators, eliminating E. coli, in compliance with the Italian regulation, and somatic coliphages, although a variable efficacy against total coliforms and\nenterococci, especially in winter season, was achieved. Although the lagooning unit provides a high removal of\nthe main microbial groups, it did not reduce physico-chemical parameters. Even if the overall performance target,\nfor the whole treatment chain, met the recent log10 reduction (?5.0), required by the European Commission, the\npersistence of enterococci, especially in winter season, poses a matter of concern for public health, for the potential risk to serve as a genetic reservoir of transferable antibiotic-resistance.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Nunziatina Russo [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Alessia Marzo., Cinzia Randazzo.,Cinzia Caggia.,Attilio Toscano.,Giuseppe Luigi Cirelli"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Fecal indicators Enterococci Wastewater reuse, lagooning, UV system", "Sumber": "Science of the Total Environment 656 (2019) 558\u2013566", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Feb 2019"}
