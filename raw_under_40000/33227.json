{"Nomor": 33227, "Judul": "Preliminary study of the source apportionment and diversity of microplastics: Taking floating microplastics in the South China Sea as an example", "Abstrak": "At present, the study of microplastic sources is in a relatively preliminary stage due to the complexity of\nmicroplastic features in the environment. Based on a literature review, we developed a source-specific\nclassification system for the quantitative analysis of microplastic sources. The classification system includes ten types of microplastics based on morphology and composition and can identify their main\nsources and the associated probabilities. To reflect the complexity of types and sources in the regional\ncombination of microplastics, we first propose a microplastic diversity index (D1-D\u2019(MP)). We use the\nSouth China Sea as an example to carry out quantitative source analysis and calculate the diversity index.\nEight types of microplastics were found, mainly consisting of maritime coatings (type \u201cGran_coat\u201d)\n(33.0%) and synthetic fibers (type \u201cFib_thin\u201d) (29.6%). We also found that the diversity increased with\noffshore distance. In addition, we partitioned surface microplastics globally according to a twodimensional microplastic abundance-diversity index. We believe that these indicators can effectively\nreflect pollution status and ultimately lead to different types of control measures. In the future, additional indicators for the characterization of microplastics must be included in the classification system to\nestablish a one-to-one source analysis system for microplastic characteristics and source apportionment.\nIn general, our study may provide new insights into the establishment of more accurate and quantitative\nsource apportionment techniques and effective pollution control.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Teng Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xinqing Zou.,Baojie Li.,Yulong Yao.,Zheng Zang.,Yali Li.,Wenwen Yu.,Wanzhi Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Microplastic Source apportionment Source-specific classification Microplastic diversity index South China Sea", "Sumber": "Environmental Pollution 245 (2019) 965-974", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Jan 2019"}
