{"Nomor": 37706, "Judul": "LIGO RESTARTS WITH QUANTUM BOOST", "Abstrak": "The hunt for gravitational waves is on again \u2014 this time assisted by the\nquirks of quantum mechanics. Three massive detectors \u2014 two in the\nUnited States called LIGO and one in Italy known as Virgo \u2014 resumed collecting data\non 1 April, after a 19-month shutdown for upgrades. Thanks in part to a quantum\nphenomenon known as light squeezing, the machines promise not only to spot more\ngravitational waves \u2014 ripples in space-time that can reveal a wealth of information about the cosmos \u2014 but also to make more detailed detections than before. Researchers hope to observe as-yet undetected events, such as a supernova or the merging of a black hole with a neutron star.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "DAVIDE CASTELVECCHI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Astronomi", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "gravitation", "Sumber": "4 APRIL 2019 | VOL 568 | NATURE | 17", "Staf Input/Edit": "pustaka bosscha", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Apr 2019"}
