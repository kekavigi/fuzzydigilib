{"Nomor": 35510, "Judul": "Wastewater alters feeding rate but not vitellogenin level of Gammarus fossarum (Amphipoda)?", "Abstrak": "Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents release complex mixtures of organic and inorganic micropollutants,\nincluding endocrine disrupting compounds, into receiving water bodies. These substances may cause adverse effects\nin aquatic communities as well as in ecosystem functions they provide. The aim of this study was to determine the\npotential impact of secondary treated wastewater released into a small Swiss stream on leaf litter decomposition\nbased on feeding rates of the amphipod shredder Gammarus fossarum measured in situ. Additionally, endocrine\ndisrupting effects downstream of the WWTP were investigated by measuring vitellogenin (vg) induction in male\ngammarids exposed in situ, as well as estrogen receptor activation using the Yeast Estrogen Screen (YES) involving\npassive sampler and grab water sample extracts. Extracts were also analysed for 424 organic micropollutants and\nselected transformation products. Gammarid feeding rate was significantly reduced 100, 200 and 400 m downstream of the WWTP effluent relative to the upstream site. While YES results showed significantly elevated\nestrogenicity at downstream sites, vg production in male gammarids was not induced. A laboratory experiment,\nin which gammarids were exposed to WWTP effluent, supported this observation. These results, hence, suggest\nthat treated wastewater released into aquatic ecosystems impairs the ecosystem function of leaf litter decomposition. Vg levels in male gammarids measured by UPLC-MS/MS did, however, not alter.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Barbara Ganser  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mirco Bundschuh.,c , Inge Werner., Nadzeya Homazava.,Eti\u00ebnne L.M.
