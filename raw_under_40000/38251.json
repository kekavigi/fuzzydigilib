{"Nomor": 38251, "Judul": "CULTURAL STUDIES IN GRADUATE PROGRAMMES IN LATIN AMERICA", "Abstrak": "In this article, we describe the eccentric location of Cultural Studies in the Latin\nAmerican   academy:   while   it   remains   marginal   in   terms   of   institutional\nrecognition,  it  is  nevertheless  important  in  terms  of  the  interest  it  arouses  in\nprofessors and students alike, and in the amount and quality of publications in the\narea. The field\u2019s general flexibility appeals both to many established researchers,\nwho employ its methodologies to expand the scope of their investigations, and to\nmany  students,  who  become  frustrated  with  disciplinary  rigidity  and  with  the\ndifficulty  in  carrying  out  academic  projects  with  overtly  political  underpinnings\nfrom  the  traditional  disciplines  of  the  humanities  and  social  sciences.  While\nstudent demand is clearly strong in much of Latin America, the response to the rise\nof Cultural Studies in the Latin American academy has taken two general forms:\n(1)   an   opening   up   of   spaces   within   existing   disciplines   (anthropology,\ncommunications,  literature,  etc.)  for  the  more  interdisciplinary  or  politicized\nwork and (2) the foundation of new programmes in Cultural Studies. We use as\nexamples  the  case  studies  of  Argentina  and  Colombia,  countries  that  have  a\ncompletely different academic history and tradition. We survey the diverse ways in\nwhich   Cultural   Studies   has   entered   institutional   spaces   in   both   countries.\nColombia  offers  the  case  of  an  academy  that  appears  to  have  welcomed  the\ninstitutionalization  of  Cultural  Studies,  at  least  superficially,  while  Argentina\nappears  to  have  resisted  ceding  the  field  institutional  space.  Nonetheless,  its\npresence in both countries is strongly palpable; it is clearly a force too strong to be\nsuppressed by resistance from the traditional disciplines.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Robert McKee Irwin  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Monica Szurmuk"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Cultural  Studies;  Latin  America;  Colombia;  Argentina; discipline; graduate", "Sumber": "Cultural Studies Vol. 26, No. 1 January 2012, pp. 8-28", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Mei 2019"}
