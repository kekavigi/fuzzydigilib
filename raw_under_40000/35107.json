{"Nomor": 35107, "Judul": "Biodegraded mackerel wastewater selectively inhibits harmful algal blooms", "Abstrak": "Functional substances from mackerel wastewater were biodegraded and tested for inhibitory activity against\nharmful algal blooms (HABs) that are detrimental to aquaculture. The supernatant from a 48 h culture of\nmackerel wastewater had a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 0.54?0.68 mg/ml for the three tested HAB\norganisms (Heterocapsa triquetra, Alexandrium fundyense and Prorocentrum minimum). This inhibitory effect was\nnot observed form 48-h biodegraded nutrient broth culture supernatant, indicating inhibitory substances did not\noriginate from bacterial metabolites. Rough estimation of molecular weight using ultrafiltration indicated that\nthe inhibitory substance was less than 2 kDa, and it did not inhibit the non-HAB organism (Skeletonema costatum), which is essential for preserving marine ecosystems in real-world applications. Furthermore, this inhibitory effect against HABs was not observed for biodegraded culture supernatants of other protein sources\n(skim milk and okara), indicating that the inhibitory substances were derived from a particular source present\nonly in raw mackerel wastewater. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the selective\ninhibitory effects of the culture supernatant of mackerel wastewater against HABs.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ja Young Cho [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hyun Yi Jung.,Joong Kyun Kim"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Selective inhibitory effect Harmful algal bloom Low molecular weight substance Biodegradation Mackerel wastewater", "Sumber": "Journal of Hazardous Materials 364 (2019) 349\u2013355", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Feb 2019"}
