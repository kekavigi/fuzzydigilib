{"Nomor": 32587, "Judul": "Airplane boarding meets express line queues", "Abstrak": "Airlines have been implementing several policies which partition passengers into groups of fast\nand  slow  passengers  and  placing  them  in  different  queue/row  combinations.   For  example,  the\npolicy which provides boarding precedence to passengers needing assistance and families traveling\nwith small children,  or a policy which provides precedence to passengers with no overhead bin\nluggage.  The idea of separating customers into groups with different service times also appears\nin the very different setting of express line queues, for example, in the supermarket or in server\nfarms.  Such queues have been extensively explored in the last 20 years in the queueing theoretic\nliterature.\nWe show that the two systems,  airplane boarding with slow and fast passenger groups and\nexpress line queues are intimately related in the asymptotic regime where the ratio between the\nslowest and fastest customer becomes large.  We produce good algorithms for placing different\ngroups of passengers in the airplane boarding setting with competitive guarantees compared to\noptimal placements.  We then show how we can analyze the airplane boarding setting using results\nfrom the express line setting.  This relation provides a novel bridge between the theory of project\nmanagement and the critical path method to which airplane boarding belongs and queueing theory\nto which express line queues belong.\nThe  analysis  uses  very  basic  notions  and  arguments  from  geometry,  but  in  the  setting  of\nspace-time (Lorentzian) geometry, a geometry which was invented to study relativity theory.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Eitan Bachmat [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Transportation, airplane boarding, queueing", "Sumber": "-", "Staf Input/Edit": "Erlin Marliana Effendi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Des 2018"}
