{"Nomor": 37726, "Judul": "Scheduling delay protocols integrating voice and data on a bus LAN", "Abstrak": "Two new protocols integrating voice\nand data on a multiaccess broadcast bus LAN\nwith reverse round robin service are presented.\nThe protocols arc based on a collision free scheduling\ndelay access mechanism. According to this\nmechanism, each station computes its transmission\ntime relying on the activity of the bus. In the\nfirst protocol, we use this mechanism for both\nvoice and data traffic. In the second protocol, the\ndata traffic is based on the above mechanism,\nwhile, for the voice traffic, we additionally exploit\nthe periodicity of voice. Separation of the two\ntraffic types is achieved by the requirement for\nsharing the channel alternately in voice and data\nrounds. The transmission of data packets and\nvoice call packets for setting up calls is assigned to\nthe data round while the transmission of voice\npackets is assigned to the voice round. The proposed\nprotocols were studied via simulation tools.\nThey satisfy the delay constraint of voice traffic\nand, at the same time, guarantee a sufficient bandwidth\nfor data traffic. Results obtained under\nvarious traffic conditions are given.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "S. Bolis, MSc [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["E.G. Economou, PhD Prof. G.
