{"Nomor": 38969, "Judul": "Combining Inkjet Printing with Emulsion Solvent Evaporation to Pattern Polymeric Particles", "Abstrak": "We demonstrate a concept to produce deposits of polymer in the\nform of particles by inkjet printing an emulsion in which the discrete phase\nevaporates preferentially. An oil/water emulsion with polymer contained inside the\noil phase is used as ink for printing. Circular deposits of spherical polymer particles\nwith uniform thickness are obtained. The effects of the hydrophobicity of substrates\nand the physical properties of the oil on the morphology of the deposits are\nexplored. The deposit of aggregated polymeric particles can be transformed into a\nuniform film by annealing if required. This strategy for the patterning of polymer\nmaterials in the form of either particles or a film works for mixtures of polymers and\nfunctional cargoes.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Renhua Deng 1.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170718"}, "Penulis": "Renhua Deng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Lisong Yang, and Colin D.
