In this paper, the response of GPR from different parameters of the landmine targets\nhas been shown and the data is correlated with observed field experiment made in 2012 at Miami\nCrandon Park test site. The ability of GPR for detecting non-metallic mines with different orientations\nwas revealed and soil effect upon the GPR signal was examined putting into consideration the soil parameters\nin different locations in Egypt such as in Sinai and El Alamein. The simulation results showed that\nPMN-2 landmine was detected at 5 cm and 15 cm depths, even at the minimum radar cross section vertical\norientation. The B-Scan (2D GPR profiles) of PMN-2 target at 15 cm depth figured out high reflectivity\nfor Wadi deposits due to large contrast between PMN-2 landmine material and soil of sand dunes.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Shereen M.
