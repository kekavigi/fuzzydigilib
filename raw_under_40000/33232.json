{"Nomor": 33232, "Judul": "CO2 Storage In Depleted Gas Reservoirs: A Study On The Effect Of Residual Gas Saturation", "Abstrak": "Depleted gas reservoirs are recognized as the most promising candidate for carbon dioxide storage.\nPrimary gas production followed by injection of carbon dioxide after depletion is the strategy\nadopted for secondary gas recovery and storage practices. This strategy, however, depends on the\ninjection strategy, reservoir characteristics and operational parameters. There have been many\nstudies to-date discussing critical factors influencing the storage performance in depleted gas\nreservoirs while little attention was given to the effect of residual gas. In this paper, an attempt was\nmade to highlight the importance of residual gas on the capacity, injectivity, reservoir pressurization, and trapping mechanisms of storage sites through the use of numerical simulation. The\nresults obtained indicated that the storage performance is proportionally linked to the amount of\nresidual gas in the medium and reservoirs with low residual fluids are a better choice for storage\npurposes. Therefore, it would be wise to perform the secondary recovery before storage in order to\nhave the least amount of residual gas in the medium. Although the results of this study are useful to\nscreen depleted gas reservoirs for the storage purpose, more studies are required to confirm the\nfinding presented in this paper.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ARSHAD RAZA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Raoof Gholami, Reza Rezaee, Chua Han Bing, Ramasamy Nagaraja, Mohamed Ali Hamid"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "CO2 storage, Dry gas reservoir, Long term reservoir simulation, Residual gas saturation", "Sumber": "Petroleum 4 (2018) 95-107 - KeAi, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2017.05.005", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Jan 2019"}
