{"Nomor": 36254, "Judul": "High-Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells Using DopedPoly(triarylamine) as the Hole Transport Layer", "Abstrak": "Organolead trihalide perovskite materials have attractedconsiderable interest because of their successful application in fabricatinghigh-efficiency photovoltaic cells. Charge transport layers play a significant rolein improving the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In thiswork, we investigated the p-type doping effect of the poly(triarylamine)(PTAA) layer on the performance of PSCs by using three dopants. We observethat doping copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) into PTAA led to a higherperformance improvement for the PSCs than the use of copper(I) iodide (CuI)or lithium salt (Li-TFSI) as the dopant. The power conversion efficiency (PCE)of the PSCs significantly improved from 14.22% to 18.16% upon doping 2.0 wt% CuSCN with simultaneously enhanced open-circuit voltage, short-circuitcurrent density, andfill factor. The long-term stability of the PSCs was alsoimproved with significantly reduced PCE degradation (from 79% to 25%) after200 h. Our results provide a simple method to improve the performance of planar PSCs by adding dopants into PTAA.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Yawen_Liu_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/161865"}, "Penulis": "Yawen Liu, [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zhihai Liu,Eun-Cheol Lee"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "perovskite solar cells, doping, stability, hole transport layer, CuSCN, CuI, PTAA", "Sumber": "ACSAppl.EnergyMater.XXXX, XXX, XXX?XXX", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Mar 2019"}
