{"Nomor": 39036, "Judul": "Improvement of the Cycling Performance of LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 Cathode Active Materials by a Dual-Conductive Polymer Coating", "Abstrak": "LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cathode materials were surface-modified by coating\nwith a dual conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-co-poly(ethylene glycol)\n(PEDOT-co-PEG) copolymer, and their resulting electrochemical properties were\ninvestigated. The surface-modified LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cathode material exhibited a high\ndischarge capacity and good high rate performance due to enhanced transport of Li+ ions\nas well as electrons. The presence of a protective conducting polymer layer formed on the\ncathode also suppressed the growth of a resistive layer and inhibited the dissolution of\ntransition metals from the active cathode materials, which resulted in more stable cycling\ncharacteristics than the pristine LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cathode material at 55 o\nC.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Seo Hee Ju 1.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170874"}, "Penulis": "Seo Hee Ju [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ik-Su Kang, Yoon-Sung Lee, Won-Kyung Shin, Saheum Kim, Kyomin Shin, Dong-Won Kim"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "conductive polymer, surface modification, LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2, protective coating, cycling performance", "Sumber": "www.acsami.org    dx.doi.org/10.1021/am404965p | ACS Appl.
