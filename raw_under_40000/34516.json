{"Nomor": 34516, "Judul": "The effects of leakage error on terrestrial water storage variations in the Yangtze River Basin measured by GRACE", "Abstrak": "The Yangtze River Basin is an important economic area in China. Monitoring TWS change in this basin is strongly\nmeaningful for exploitation of water resources and economic development. Filtering is necessary to derive the\nTWS from GRACE time-variable gravity field models, but the signal is distorted. Therefore, we subtract the leakage error from the filtered TWS change to acquire the attenuation signal. We use a scale factor derived from the\nbasin characteristic function to recover the attenuation signal. We propose a so-called third-filter method to gain\nthe temporal distribution of the leakage error. In addition, we compare the TWS obtained using the third-filter\nmethod with that from other approaches, e.g., the scaling-factor approach, addictive correction approach, and\nmultiplicative correction approach. In the spatial distribution, we compare the results from these three\napproaches with that from the second-filter method. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our method\nin simulation studies. By using the GRACE data, we further analyze the effect of leakage error on TWS change\nin the Yangtze River Basin, and we compare the restored signal after correcting the leakage error with the\nWGHM and in-situ measurements of TGR impoundment. The results indicate: (1) From the third-filter method,\nthe annual amplitude of TWS change in the Yangtze River Basin corresponds to a 4.4 \u00b1 0.5 cm equivalent water\nthickness, while the semi-annual amplitude is up to an equivalent water thickness of 0.7 \u00b1 0.5 cm. These results\nare more consistent with the WGHM model after leakage error is corrected. (2) Additionally, the GRACE and\nmodel results show coincident annual fluctuation of the TWS in the basin, with the largest increase in August\nevery year. The whole trend of third-filter method result in TGR area is closer to yearly change rate of TGR volume. (3) The third-filter method effectively reconstructs the temporal distribution of the TWS from the GRACE\nfiltering data. And the multiplicative correction method may achieve a higher precision of spatial TWS change\nin the basin.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Wanqiu Li [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Chuanyin Zhang, Hanjiang Wen, Wei Feng, Wei Wang, Yulong Zhon, Zhen Li, Cai Yin,  Yuanqi Lu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "GRACE TWS Leakage error Scale factor Third-filter", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 160 (2019) 264\u2013272, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.12.001", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Feb 2019"}
