{"Nomor": 37487, "Judul": "Repurposing vitamin D for treatment of human malignancies via targeting tumor microenvironment", "Abstrak": "Tumor cells along with a small proportion of cancer stem cells exist in a stromal microenvironment consisting of vasculature, cancer-associated fibroblasts, immune cells and extracellular components. Recent epidemiological and clinical studies strongly support that vitamin D supplementation is associated with reduced cancer risk and favorable prognosis. Experimental results suggest that vitamin D not only suppresses cancer cells, but also regulates tumor microenvironment to facilitate tumor repression. In this review, we have outlined the current knowledge on epidemiological studies and clinical trials of vitamin D. Notably, we summarized and discussed the anticancer action of vitamin D in cancer cells, cancer stem cells and stroma cells in tumor microenvironment, providing a better understanding of the role of vitamin D in cancer. We presently re-propose vitamin D to be a novel and economical anticancer agent.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP XU WU 1": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164634"}, "Penulis": "Xu Wu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wei Hu, LanLu, Yueshui Zhao, Yejiang Zhoud, ZhangangXiao,  Lin Zhang, Hanyu Zhang, Xiaobing Li, Wanping Li, Shengpeng Wang, Chi Hin Cho, Jing Shen, Mingxing Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Vitamin D, 1?,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3, Tumor microenvironment, Cancer stem cell, Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte, Tumor-derived endothelial cell, Cancer-associated fibroblast", "Sumber": "Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica B Volume 9, Issue 2, March 2019, Pages 203-219", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Mar 2019"}
