{"Nomor": 34352, "Judul": "Sustainable finance. A critical realist perspective", "Abstrak": "This article seeks to respond to certain epistemological challenges which are posed to the traditional\nmethods of inquiry used in finance by the emergence of sustainable finance. We first\nunderline the qualitative changes that have been induced in the finance function by the imperatives\nof sustainable finance. Then, through the prism of critical realism, we analyse it to\nreveal a contradiction, which we attribute to a misconceived social ontology in academic finance.\nFinally, we outline methodological avenues which might allow us to overcome these difficulties\nand pave the way for a more realist and pluralist approach to finance research in the 21st century.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_THOMAS_LAGOARDE-SEGOT_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/155802"}, "Penulis": "Thomas Lagoarde-Segot [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Aktuaria", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Insurance", "Kata Kunci": "Finance, Sustainability, Epistemology", "Sumber": "Research in International Business and Finance 47 (2019) 1\u20139", "Staf Input/Edit": "Dwi Ary Fuziastuti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Feb 2019"}
