Several algorithms measuring selected aspects of finger image quality have been proposed in the literature, yet only few of them have found their way into quality assessment algorithms used in practice. The authors provide comprehensive algorithm descriptions and make available implementations of adaptations of ten quality assessment algorithms from the literature which operates at the local or the global image level. They evaluate the performance on four datasets in terms of the capability in determining samples causing false non-matches and by their Spearman correlation with sample utility. The authors\u2019 evaluation shows that both the capability in rejecting samples causing false non-matches and the correlation between features varies depending on the dataset.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Martin Aastrup Olsen [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Vladimir Smida, Christoph Busch"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Mobile Biometrics", "Sumber": "IET Biometrics", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Apr 2019"}
