These fluctuations play a dominant part in the\nquantum critical region surrounding the transition point, where\nthe dynamics is governed by the universal properties associated\nwith the QPT. Although time-dependent phenomena associated\nwith classical, thermally driven phase transitions have been\nextensively studied in systems ranging from the early Universe to\nBose\u2013Einstein condensates2\u20135, understanding critical real-time\ndynamics in isolated, non-equilibrium quantum systems remains\na challenge6. Here we use a Rydberg atom quantum simulator with\nprogrammable interactions to study the quantum critical dynamics\nassociated with several distinct QPTs.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Alexander Keesling [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ahmed Omran, Harry Levine"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Quantum Kibble, Rydberg simulator", "Sumber": "Nature", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Apr 2019"}
