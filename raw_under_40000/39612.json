{"Nomor": 39612, "Judul": "POWER TRANSFORMER DEGRADATION AND INSULATION CONDITION INDEX ESTIMATION BASED ON HISTORICAL OIL DATA", "Abstrak": "Power transformer is one of the most important assets for any electricity utility.\nThe overall power transformer health condition can be assessed through the\ncondition of its insulation system. Furan, dissolved gas analysis, water content,\nbreakdown voltage, interfacial tension, acidity, and oil color are commonly used\nas fault diagnostic oil parameters that can assess the health condition of power\ntransformers. Degradation condition of power transformer insulation system,\nespecially paper insulation, reflects the transformer aging condition.\nUnfortunately, continuous aging process of power transformer insulation system\ncannot be avoided due to the severe operating conditions that a transformer is\noperating on. So, it is very important to regularly monitor the condition of power\ntransformer insulation to maintain its reliability. Historical data of transformer\ninsulations are very substantial to define the history of power transformer health\ncondition. This research introduces a method to predict the degradation condition\nand provide insulation index estimation of power transformers based on these\nhistorical data.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Muhammad Fuad Al Hamdani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/172514", "COVER Muhammad Fuad Al Hamdani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/194919", "BAB 1 Muhammad Fuad Al Hamdani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/194920", "BAB 2 Muhammad Fuad Al Hamdani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/194921", "BAB 3 Muhammad Fuad Al Hamdani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/194922", "BAB 4 Muhammad Fuad Al Hamdani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/194923", "BAB 5 Muhammad Fuad Al Hamdani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/194924", "PUSTAKA Muhammad Fuad Al Hamdani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/194925"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Fuad Al Hamdani [23217120]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
