{"Nomor": 33243, "Judul": "Microplastic and charred microplastic in the Faafu Atoll, Maldives", "Abstrak": "Microplastics are recognized as a growing threat for the marine environment that may even affect areas generally considered pristine. In this work we surveyed the microplastic contamination in the Faafu Atoll (Maldives,\nIndian Ocean) across twelve sampling station, located either inside or outside the reef rim. Sediments and\nseawater samples were collected. Despite the remoteness of the atoll, the scarce local population and low\ntouristic annual afflux, the detected average abundance were 0.32 \u00b1 0.15 particles/m3 in the surface water and\n22.8 \u00b1 10.5 particles/m2 in the beach sediments. Polymers identified through Fourier-Transform Infrared\nspectroscopy were mostly polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride, polyethyleneterephtalate, and polyamide. Elastomeric residues and charred microparticles were also found. In\nparticular, the charred microparticles were prevalently located nearby the inhabited island and they might be\nconsidered a peculiarity of the area, related to local practice of burning plastic waste at the shoreline.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Francesco Saliu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Simone Montano.,Maria Grazia Garavaglia.,, Marina Lasagni.,Davide Seveso.,Paolo Galli"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Microplastic Char Atoll Reef Maldives", "Sumber": "Marine Pollution Bulletin 136 (2018) 464\u2013471", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Jan 2019"}
