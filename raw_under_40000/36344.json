{"Nomor": 36344, "Judul": "Unveiling the Origin of Superior Electrochemical Performance inPolycrystalline Dense SnO2Nanospheres as Anodes for Lithium-ionBatteries", "Abstrak": "Development of feasible electrode materials issignificant to realize high energy density Li-ion batteries (LIBs).Tin(IV) oxide, in particular, has a number of merits includinghigher theoretical capacity compared with graphite (1493 mAhg?1), low cost, and environmental friendliness. Nevertheless,huge volume changes and subsequent pulverization usuallyresulted in poor capacity retention of SnO2, where variousnanostructures have been adopted to overcome its intrinsiclimitations. Here we introduce the new insights into employingpolycrystalline dense SnO2nanospheres (NSs), rather than itshollow structures, as high-performance electrode for LIBs.Contrary to the previous notions, polycrystalline dense SnO2NSs can exhibit highly stable cycle retention characteristics(1009.9 mAh g?1after 300 cycles at 0.5 A g?1) as well asconsiderable rate capabilities (349 mAh g?1at 5.0 A g?1), even superior to those of polycrystalline hollow SnO2NSs. Based onthe in situ TEM analyses and electrochemical/postmortem analyses, such improved electrochemical performance can beattributed to the (i) predominant isotropic volume changes of polycrystalline SnO2, (ii) formation of numerous nanograinswithin the NSs, and (iii) maintenance of structural integrity without pulverizations. This work sheds lights on the importance ofusing polycrystalline dense nanostructures to mitigate the effects of large volume changes and minimize pulverization, which canalso be applied to other electrode materials.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Jun_Young_Cheong_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/162053"}, "Penulis": "Jun Young Cheong [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Joon Ha Chang,Chanhoon Kim,Jiyoung Lee,Yoon-Su Shim,Seung Jo Yoo,Jong Min Yuk,Il-Doo Kim"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "dense SnO2nanosphere, electrode, in situ TEM, lithium, battery", "Sumber": "ACSAppl.EnergyMater.XXXX, XXX, XXX?XXX", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Mar 2019"}
