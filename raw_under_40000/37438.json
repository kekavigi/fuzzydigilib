{"Nomor": 37438, "Judul": "Complete temporal mode characterization of non-Gaussian states by a dual homodyne measurement", "Abstrak": "Optical quantum states defined in temporal modes, especially non-Gaussian states, such as photon-number states, play an important role in quantum computing schemes. In general, the temporal mode structures of these states are characterized by one or more complex functions called temporal mode functions (TMFs). Although we can calculate the TMF theoretically in some cases, experimental estimation of a TMF is more advantageous to utilize the states with high purity. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate complex TMFs. This method can be applied not only to arbitrary single temporal mode non-Gaussian states, but also to two temporal mode states containing two photons. This method is implemented by continuous-wave dual homodyne measurement and does not need prior information of the target states nor state reconstruction procedure. We demonstrate this method by analyzing several experimentally created non-Gaussian states.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Kan Takase [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Masanori Okada,", "Takahiro Serikawa,", "Shuntaro Takeda,", "Jun-ichi Yoshikawa,", "and Akira Furusawa"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW A 99, 033832 (2019); \u00a92019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Mar 2019"}
