{"Nomor": 36380, "Judul": "Cathepsin G Activity as a New Marker for Detecting Airway Inflammation by Microscopy and Flow Cytometry", "Abstrak": "Muco-obstructive lung diseases feature extensive\nbronchiectasis due to the uncontrolled release of\nneutrophil serine proteases into the airways. To assess if\ncathepsin G (CG) is a novel key player in chronic lung\ninflammation, we developed membrane-bound (mSAM) and\nsoluble (sSAM) FRET reporters. The probes quantitatively\nrevealed elevated CG activity in samples from 46 patients. For\nfuture basic science and personalized clinical applications, we\ndeveloped a rapid, highly informative, and easily translatable\nsmall-molecule FRET flow cytometry assay for monitoring\nprotease activity including cathepsin G. We demonstrated that\nmSAM distinguished healthy from patient cells by FRET-based\nflow cytometry with excellent correlation to confocal microscopy data.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Matteo Guerra [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dario Frey, Matthias Hagner, Susanne Dittrich, Michelle Paulsen, Marcus A.
