{"Nomor": 38913, "Judul": "A fidelity-restricted distributed principal component analysis compression algorithm for non-cable seismographs", "Abstrak": "This paper proposes a distributed principal component analysis seismic data compression algorithm based on fidelity restriction for non-cable seismic exploration systems. The proposed method compresses data effectively according to a customized fidelity. It first determines the cumulative contribution rate, then calculates the global eigenvector matrix, generates a projection in the seismographs and finally transmits the projected data. The numerical simulation results show that when the total waveform fidelity reaches 92%, the compression ratio still stands at 77 times or more. Furthermore, the field experiment also verifies the performance of the algorithm.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP FAN ZHENG 1": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170640"}, "Penulis": "Fan Zheng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yalan Ling, Yuqing Tang, Shuai Hui, Hongyuan Yang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Seismic data compression Fidelity-restricted Non-cable seismographs Distributed principal component analysis", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics,  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2019.06.004", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Jun 2019"}
