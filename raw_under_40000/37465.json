{"Nomor": 37465, "Judul": "Certifying Nonclassical Behavior for Negative Keldysh Quasiprobabilities", "Abstrak": "We introduce an experimental test for ruling out classical explanations for the statistics obtained when\nmeasuring arbitrary observables at arbitrary times using individual detectors. This test requires some trust\nin the measurements, represented by a few natural assumptions on the detectors. In quantum theory, the\nconsidered scenarios are well captured by von Neumann measurements. These can be described naturally\nin terms of the Keldysh quasiprobability distribution (KQPD), and the imprecision and backaction exerted\nby the measurement apparatus. We find that classical descriptions can be ruled out from measured data if\nand only if the KQPD exhibits negative values.We provide examples based on simulated data, considering\nthe influence of a finite amount of statistics. In addition to providing an experimental tool for certifying\nnonclassicality, our results bestow an operational meaning upon the nonclassical nature of negative\nquasiprobability distributions such as the Wigner function and the full counting statistics", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Patrick P.
