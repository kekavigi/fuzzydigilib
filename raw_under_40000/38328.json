The design, development\nand delivery of technology enhanced learning in pre-service teacher education programs is\ntherefore gaining momentum, both in Australia and internationally. Much research\nregarding online, or blended learning, has focussed on theoretically-founded learning\nareas, with less attention directed toward fundamentally practical learning areas, such as\nDesign and Technology Education. Situated within the Bachelor of Education (Early\nChildhood Education, Primary, and Primary/Middle) degrees at the University of South\nAustralia, Australia, this study captures the design, development and delivery of a blended\nDesign and Technology course with first and third year pre-service teachers. Drawing on\ncourse learning analytics, pre-service teacher responses, and the reflective practice of\nteaching academics, this paper highlights the facilitators and challenges in transitioning to\na blended model of curriculum delivery that addresses the contexts of the Australian\nCurriculum: Technologies.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Marnie Best  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Denise MacGregor"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Design and Technology Education, Curriculum, Online learning, Learner support, Pre-service teacher education", "Sumber": "International Journal Technology Des Educ (2017) 27:201\u2013213", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Mei 2019"}
