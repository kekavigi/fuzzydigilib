{"Nomor": 37987, "Judul": "Analysis of pressure falloff tests of non-Newtonian power-law fluids in naturally-fractured bounded reservoirs", "Abstrak": "Application of non-Newtonian Power-law fluids (e.g. polymeric solutions) for production\nenhancement in petroleum reservoirs has increased over the last three decades. These fluids are\noften injected as viscous solutions to improve mobility ratio and enhance oil recovery during\nchemical flooding. As part of the flooding operation, surfactant (or micellar) solutions are first\ninjected at the leading edge of the flood to reduce interfacial tension between water and oil.\nSubsequently, a slug of polymer solution is injected ahead of normal water to increase viscosity of\nthe water, improve volumetric sweep efficiency and accelerate oil production. Analysis of pressure\ntests conducted pre and post injection, to evaluate mobility of these fluids, is more demanding than\nconventional techniques, which were developed strictly for Newtonian fluids. In naturally-fractured\nreservoirs, flow of non-Newtonian fluids is more complex due to fracture-matrix interaction which\nis usually resonated in the pressure footprints. Some models have been developed to aid interpretation of pressure tests, but boundary effects on down-hole measurements due to structural\ndiscontinuity and presence of an active aquifer, have not been thoroughly investigated.\nThis article presents an analytic technique for interpreting pressure falloff tests of nonNewtonian Power-law fluids in wells that are located near boundaries in dual-porosity reservoirs. First, dimensionless pressure solutions are obtained and Stehfest inversion algorithm is used\nto develop new type curves. Subsequently, long-time analytic solutions are presented and interpretation procedure is proposed using direct synthesis. Two examples, including real field data\nfrom a heavy oil reservoir in Colombian eastern plains basin, are used to validate and demonstrate\napplication of this technique. Results agree with conventional type-curve matching procedure. The\napproach proposed in this study avoids the use of type curves, which is prone to human errors. It\nprovides a better alternative for direct estimation of formation and flow properties from falloff data.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "OMOTAYO OMOSEBI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Alpheus Igbokoyi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Non-Newtonian fluid, Pressure falloff, Bounded reservoirs, Direct synthesis, Naturally-fractured reservoirs", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 4, Pages 318-341 (December  2015)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Mei 2019"}
