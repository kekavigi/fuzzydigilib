{"Nomor": 38352, "Judul": "Drawing as Driver of Creativity: Nurturing an Intelligence of Seeing in Art Students", "Abstrak": "The article reasserts the primacy of drawing as a driver of creativity within art schools. It reviews \nspecific aspects of visual perception theory and visual communication theory relevant to a pedagogical strategy as a means of nurturing an\u2018intelligence of seeing\u2019 in art students. The domain of drawing is theorised as a systemic-functional semiotic model informed by Michael Halliday\u2019s model for language, as adapted by Michael O\u2019Toole in his 2011 The Language of Displayed Art. The model is demonstrated as an aid to the production of drawings, rather than its more-recognised efficacy as a means of negotiating meaning from existing works. The article is illustrated with examples of drawings by the author", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Howard Riley [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "drawing, pedagogy, intelligence of seeing, modes of perception, systemic-functional semiotics", "Sumber": "THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION, 2017", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Mei 2019"}
