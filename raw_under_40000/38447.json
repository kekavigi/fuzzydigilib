{"Nomor": 38447, "Judul": "Detection of Charges and Molecules with Self-Assembled NanoOscillators", "Abstrak": "Detection of a single or small amount of\ncharges and molecules in biologically relevant aqueous\nsolutions is a long-standing goal in analytical science and\ndetection technology. Here we report on self-assembled nanooscillators for charge and molecular binding detections in\naqueous solutions. Each nano-oscillator consists of a nanoparticle linked to a solid surface via a molecular tether. By\napplying an oscillating electric field normal to the surface, the\nnanoparticles oscillate, which is detected individually with ?0.1\nnm accuracy by a plasmonic imaging technique. From the\noscillation amplitude and phase, the charge of the nanoparticles is determined with a detection limit of ?0.18 electron charges along with the charge polarity. We further demonstrate\nthe detection of molecular binding with the self-assembled nano-oscillators.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Xiaonan Shan 1.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/169723"}, "Penulis": "Xiaonan Shan, [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yimin Fang, Shaopeng Wang,Yan Guan, Hong-Yuan Chen, Nongjian Tao*"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "Nano-oscillators, surface plasmon resonance, single charge detection, small molecule detection, plasmonic imaging technique", "Sumber": "pubs.acs.org/NanoLett", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Mei 2019"}
