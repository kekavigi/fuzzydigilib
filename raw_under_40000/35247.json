{"Nomor": 35247, "Judul": "The Hybrid MPC-MINLP Algorithm For Optimal Operation Of Coal-Fired Power Plants With Solvent Based Post-Combustion CO2 capture", "Abstrak": "This paper presents an algorithm that combines model predictive control (MPC) with MINLP\noptimization and demonstrates its application for coal-fired power plants retrofitted with solvent\nbased post-combustion CO2 capture (PCC) plant. The objective function of the optimization algorithm works at a primary level to maximize plant economic revenue while considering an optimal\ncarbon capture profile. At a secondary level, the MPC algorithm is used to control the performance\nof the PCC plant. Two techno-economic scenarios based on fixed (capture rate is constant) and\nflexible (capture rate is variable) operation modes are developed using actual electricity prices\n(2011) with fixed carbon prices ($AUD 5, 25, 50/tonne-CO2) for 24 h periods. Results show that fixed\noperation mode can bring about a ratio of net operating revenue deficit at an average of 6% against\nthe superior flexible operation mode.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Norhuda Abdul Manaf  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Abdul Qadir", "Ali Abbas"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Carbon capture, PCC, Flexible operation, Modeling, Algorithm, Optimization", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 3, Issue 1, Pages 155-166 (March 2017)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Feb 2019"}
