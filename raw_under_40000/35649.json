{"Nomor": 35649, "Judul": "Experimental investigation of the shear mechanical behavior of sandstone under unloading normal stress", "Abstrak": "Excavations in rocks always induce unloading of stress in excavation-disturbed zones. In many cases, rocks fail\ndue to shear under unloading normal stress. To study the shear mechanical behavior of sandstone under unloading normal stress, a new loading path was proposed, and direct shear tests under unloading normal stress\nwere performed on sandstone samples. For the unloading test, normal stress was first applied, and then, shear\nstress was gradually applied to a desired level. After that, the normal stress was unloaded until the sample failed.\nThe shear and normal displacements, shear strength, failure criterion and failure pattern were analyzed. Three\ncharacteristic displacements, i.e., the failure shear displacement Df, the shear displacement of unloading Dsu, and\nthe normal displacement of unloading Dnu, were also analyzed in detail to describe the evolution of shear and\nnormal deformation during the tests. The results indicated that the initial normal stress and initial shear stress\nsignificantly influence the three displacements, except for the shear displacement of unloading Dsu, which is not\nsensitive to varying initial shear stress. Shear displacement shows linear growth at the initial stage of unloading\nnormal stress and then increases nonlinearly and rapidly immediately before failure occurs. The failure normal\nstress increases linearly with the initial shear stress, while the failure normal stress grows exponentially as the\ninitial normal stress increases. The Mohr-Coulomb criterion describes well the change in shear strength with\nvarying initial shear stress. Compared to the direct shear test under constant normal stress, cohesion in the direct\nshear test under unloading normal stress decreases noticeably, while the internal friction angle increases slightly", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Tantan Zhu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Da Huang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Rock mechanics, Unloading normal stress, Shear strength, Deformation Shear dilatancy", "Sumber": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrmms.2019.01.003", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Feb 2019"}
