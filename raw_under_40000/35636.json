The cultural geographies of  installation art", "Abstrak": "In the mid 1980s Cosgrove described a geography based on the \u2018Argument of the Eye\u2019. Since \nthen geography, like the humanities more broadly, has seen the decline of vision\u2019s hegemony with \nembodied accounts of vision taking the place of the detached Cartesian observer. In this article I \nconsider what the geographer\u2019s argument of the eye looks like today. In contrast to many recent \nstudies I return to art as a site from which to build my arguments about vision. Employing a mode \nof enquiry that uses my body as a \u2018research instrument\u2019 the article stages four encounters with a \npiece of installation art by Tomoko Takahashi. Such embodied enquiries place a series of demands \nupon the writer, so a part of this article is devoted to critical engagement with an embodied politics \nof writing, a form of writing which is responsive to the arguments made about the experience of \ninstallation art and therefore the argument of the eye the article develops", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Harriet Hawkins [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "embodied methodologies, embodied writing, installation art, senses, vision", "Sumber": "cultural geographies 17(3) 321\u2013340", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Feb 2019"}
