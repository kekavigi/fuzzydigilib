{"Nomor": 33244, "Judul": "SPIN-ORBIT SPLITTING OF ANDREEV STATES REVEALED BY MICROWAVE SPECTROSCOPY", "Abstrak": "We perform microwave spectroscopy of Andreev states in superconducting weak links tailored in an\nInAs-Al (core-full shell) epitaxially grown nanowire. The spectra present distinctive features with bundles\nof four lines crossing when the superconducting phase difference across the weak link is 0 or ?.We interpret these features as arising from zero-field spin-split Andreev states. A simple analytical model, which takes into account the Rashba spin-orbit interaction in a nanowire containing several transverse subbands,\nexplains these features and their evolution with magnetic field. Our results show that the spin degree of\nfreedom is addressable in Josephson junctions and constitute a first step towards its manipulation.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "L.
