{"Nomor": 30331, "Judul": "KONSTRUKSI DAN EKSPRESI MUTAN GEN PENGKODE ?-AMILASE BMAN2 W198F DAN W198A PADA  _ESCHERIECHIA COLI_", "Abstrak": "a-Amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) catalyzes the hydrolysis of o-1,4-glycosidic linkages in starch \n\nproducing linear and branched oligosaccharides. c-Amylase BmaN2, *am Bacillus \n\nmegaterium NL3 isolated from Kakaban Lake, East Kalimantan, can degrade raw starch. \n\nTrp198 is predicted as potential starch binding site (SBS) which helps BmaNZ in degrading \n\nraw starch. The aims of this study were to construct bmaN2 mutant, and to study the role of \n\nTrp198 in starch hydrolysis. A codon TGG at position 592,593, and.594 encoding Trp198 \n\nwas changed into TTC and CGG encoding Phe198 (W198F) and Ala198 (W198A), \n\nrespectively. The mutation were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. BmaN2wild type and \n\nmutants (bmaN2 W198F and bmaN2 W198A) were expressed in E. coli ArcticExpress \n\n(DE3) using IPTG 0.5 M as an inducer for 24 hours at 15 'C. SDS-PAGE analysis showed \n\nthat BmaN2 wild type, BmaN2 Wl98F, and BmaN2 W198A have molecular weight of \n\n-61.5 kDa. BmN2 activity was determined by DNS method which is based on the amount \n\nof reducing sugar at 40'C and pH 8 for 10 minutes. The specific activity of BmaN2 wild \n\ntype, BmaN2 W198F, and BmaN2 W198A were 72.3 Uimg; 17.0 Ulmg; and 13.3 Ulmg, \n\nrespectively. The degree of raw starch hydrolysis using rice, wheat, ganyong, corn, potato, \n\ncassava and sago in BmaN2 wild type, respectively were 16.53%,25.33ya, l4.4lyo, 13.82o/o, \n\n7 .94oh, 14,.89yo, and l6.7Yr. The degree of hydrolysis of BmaN2 W198F in each raw starch \n\nsubstrates were 14.620/o,25.24yo, 13.48%, 13.33yo,7 .37yo, 12.930 , dan I4.9A%. The degree \n\nof hydrolysis of BmaN2 Wl98A in each raw starch substrates were 12.834/o, 21.94/o, \n\nll.99yo, 12.860/o,7 .A3yo, 11 .Ilyo, dan 13.73%", "Daftar File": {"2018 TA PP RIRI ELVIA DWIFITIRIAYU 1- ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/138586"}, "Penulis": "RERE ELVIA DWIFITRIAYU [10414009]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing 1 : Dr. Dessy Natalia Pembimbing 2 : Dr. Fernita Puspasari"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "o-Amylase, bmaN2, Raw Starch Degrading Amylase (RSDA), Starch Binding Site (SBS), site directed mutagenesis.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor \u00a0\n                                     Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Jun 2018"}
