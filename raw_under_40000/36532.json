Their effectiveness has been shown in several lab-scale and pilot-scale studies;\nhowever, there is a paucity of published data on pilot-scale systems treating genuine wastewater. This\nstudy aims to assess the performance of a pilot-scale system, carrying Phragmites australis in combination\nwith three plant growth promoting and dye-degrading bacteria (Acinetobacter junii strain NT-15, Rhodococcus sp. strain NT-39, and Pseudomonas indoloxydans strain NT-38) for the treatment of textile industry wastewater (Interloop Limited, Faisalabad, Pakistan). Fifteen FTW macrocosms were established\ncomprising plants and bacteria separately or in combination. Each unit was capable to carry 1000 L of the\nwastewater and the system was operated in a batch-wise mode for the period of 2 years. After a year of\ninstallation, performance of all FTWs units was optimal. A high removal in organic and inorganic pollutants was observed in the vegetated tanks, whereas combined application of plants and bacteria\nfurther enhanced the removal performance, i.e., chemical oxygen demand was reduced to 92%,\nbiochemical oxygen demand to 91%, color to 86%, and trace metals to approximately 87% in the\nwastewater. The augmented bacteria displayed persistence in water as well as in the roots and shoots of\nP. australis suggesting a potential partnership with the host towards enhanced performance. Treated\nwastewater met the National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS) set by the Government of\nPakistan, thus, suggesting its discharge in the surface water without any potential risks. This pilot-scale\nstudy is a step forward towards sustainable remediation of the textile wastewater in the field", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Nain Tara [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": [", Muhammad Arslan.,Zahid Hussain .,Mazhar Iqbal.,Qaisar Mahmood Khan.,Muhammad Afzal"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Floating treatment wetlands Plant-bacteria partnership Textile wastewater Wastewater treatment", "Sumber": "Journal of Cleaner Production 217 (2019) 541-548", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Mar 2019"}
