{"Nomor": 37711, "Judul": "Empirical mode decomposition for online handwritten signature verification", "Abstrak": "The handwritten signature is a biometric method used to verify a person\u2019s identity. This study lies within the\nscope of an online handwritten signature verification system, in which a signature is modelled by an analytical\napproach based on the empirical mode decomposition. The organised system is tested on the SVC2004 task1 and MYCT-100 databases. The implemented evaluation protocol shows the importance of the adopted method and allows obtaining an equal error rate of 1.83 and 2.23% for the SVC2004 task1 and the MYCT-100 databases, respectively.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Toufik Hafs [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Layachi Bennacer, Mohamed Boughazi, Amine Nait-Ali"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Empirical mode decomposition, online handwritten signature verification", "Sumber": "IET Biometrics", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Apr 2019"}
