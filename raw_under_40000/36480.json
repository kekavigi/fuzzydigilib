{"Nomor": 36480, "Judul": "Experimental Study On Gas Slippage Of Marine Shale In Southern China", "Abstrak": "The shale gas reservoirs are composed of porous media of different length scales such as nanopores,\nmicropores, natural fractures and hydraulic fractures, which lead to high heterogeneity. Gas flow\nfrom pores to fractures is under different flow regimes and in the control of various flow mechanisms. The gas slippage would have significant effects on gas flow in shale. To obtain the effect of\nslippage on gas flow in matrix and fractures, contrast experiments were run by using cores with\npenetration fractures and no fractures from Marine Shale in Southern China under constant\nconfining pressure. The results showed that slippage effect dominates and increases the gas\npermeability of cores without fractures. To cores with penetration fractures, slippage effect is\nassociated with the closure degree of fractures. Slippage dominates when fractures close under low\npore pressure. Slippage weakens due to the fractures opening under high pore pressure.\nFracture opening reduces the seepage resistance and slippage effect. The Forchheimer effect occurs\nand leads to a permeability reduction.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ying Ren [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiao Guo", "Chuan Xie", "Hongqin Wu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Shale gas, Permeability, Fracture, Slippage, Effective stress", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 2, Pages 171-176 (June  2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Mar 2019"}
