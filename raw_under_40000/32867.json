{"Nomor": 32867, "Judul": "DIRECT MEASUREMENT OF FOCUSING FIELDS IN ACTIVE PLASMA LENSES", "Abstrak": "Active plasma lenses have the potential to enable broad-ranging applications of plasma-based\naccelerators owing to their compact design and radially symmetric kT/m-level focusing fields, facilitating\nbeam-quality preservation and compact beam transport. We report on the direct measurement of magnetic\nfield gradients in active plasma lenses and demonstrate their impact on the emittance of a charged particle\nbeam. This is made possible by the use of a well-characterized electron beam with 1.4 mm mrad normalized\nemittance from a conventional accelerator. Field gradients of up to 823 T=m are investigated. The observed\nemittance evolution is supported by numerical simulations, which suggests the potential for conservation\nof the core beam emittance in such a plasma lens setup.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "J.-H.
