{"Nomor": 36135, "Judul": "Predicted Pressure-Induced Superconducting Transition in Electride Li6P", "Abstrak": "Electrides are unique compounds where most of the electrons reside at interstitial regions of the crystal\nbehaving as anions, which strongly determines its physical properties. Interestingly, the magnitude and\ndistribution of interstitial electrons can be effectively modified either by modulating its chemical\ncomposition or external conditions (e.g., pressure). Most of the electrides under high pressure are\nnonmetallic, and superconducting electrides are very rare. Here we report that a pressure-induced stable\nLi6P electride, identified by first-principles swarm structure calculations, becomes a superconductor with a predicted superconducting transition temperature Tc of 39.3 K, which is the highest among the already\nknown electrides. The interstitial electrons in Li6P, with dumbbell-like connected electride states, play a\ndominant role in the superconducting transition. Other Li-rich phosphides, Li5P, Li11P2, Li15P2, and Li8P, are also predicted to be superconducting electrides, but with a lower Tc. Superconductivity in all these compounds can be attributed to a combination of a weak electronegativity of phosphorus (P) with a strong electropositivity of lithium (Li), and opens up the interest to explore high-temperature superconductivity in similar binary compounds.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ziyuan Zhao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Shoutao Zhang,", "Tong Yu,1Haiyang Xu", "Aitor Bergara,", "and Guochun Yang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 122, 097002 (2019); \u00a9 2019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Mar 2019"}
