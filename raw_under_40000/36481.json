{"Nomor": 36481, "Judul": "A Predictive Model Of Chemical Flooding For Enhanced Oil Recovery Purposes: Application Of Least Square Support Vector Machine", "Abstrak": "Applying chemical flooding in petroleum reservoirs turns into interesting subject of the recent\nresearches. Developing strategies of the aforementioned method are more robust and precise when\nthey consider both economical point of views (net present value (NPV)) and technical point of\nviews (recovery factor (RF)). In the present study huge attempts are made to propose predictive\nmodel for specifying efficiency of chemical flooding in oil reservoirs. To gain this goal, the new type\nof support vector machine method which evolved by Suykens and Vandewalle was employed. Also,\nhigh precise chemical flooding data banks reported in previous works were employed to test and\nvalidate the proposed vector machine model. According to the mean square error (MSE), correlation\ncoefficient and average absolute relative deviation, the suggested LSSVM model has acceptable\nreliability; integrity and robustness. Thus, the proposed intelligent based model can be considered\nas an alternative model to monitor the efficiency of chemical flooding in oil reservoir when the\nrequired experimental data are not available or accessible.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mohammad Ali Ahmadi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Maysam Pournik"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Chemical flooding, Enhanced oil recovery (EOR), Polyme,r Surfactant, Least square support vector machine (LSSVM)", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 2, Pages 177-182 (June  2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Mar 2019"}
