{"Nomor": 35386, "Judul": "Application Of Nanotechnology For Enhancing Oil Recovery E A Review", "Abstrak": "Nanotechnology has attracted a great attention in enhancing oil recovery (EOR) due to the costeffective and environmental friendly manner. The size of nanoparticles for EOR usually is in a\nrange of 1e100 nm, which may slightly differ from various international organisations. Nanoparticles exhibit significantly different properties compared to the same fine or bulk molecules\nbecause of much higher concentration of atoms at their surface as a result of ultra-small size. In\nparticular, one of the most useful and fascinating properties of these particles is to creating a\nmassive diffusion driving force due to the large surface area, especially at high temperatures.\nPrevious studies have shown that nanoparticles can enhance oil recovery by shifting reservoir\nwettability towards more water-wet and reducing interfacial tension, yet this area is still open for\ndiscussion. It is worth noting that the potential of nanoparticles to reduce the oil viscosity, increase\nthe mobility ratio, and to alter the reservoir permeability has not been investigated to date.\nDepending on the operational conditions of the EOR process, some nanoparticles perform more\neffectively than others, thus leading to different levels of enhanced recovery. In this study, we aim\nto provide a summary on each of the popular and available nanoparticles in the market and list\ntheir optimum operational conditions. We classified nanoparticles into the three categories of\nmetal oxide, organic and inorganic particles in this article.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Chegenizadeh Negin  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Saeedi Ali", "Quan Xie"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Nanotechnology, Application, Enhanced oil recovery, Mechanisms", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 4, Pages 324-333 (December 2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Feb 2019"}
