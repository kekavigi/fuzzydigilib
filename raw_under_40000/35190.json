{"Nomor": 35190, "Judul": "Geoelectrical exploration of groundwater at West Dayrout Area, Assiut Governorate, Egypt", "Abstrak": "The study area includes a western limestone plateau with a narrow strip of Nile Valley and extended between\nLatitudes 27\u00b0 27?\u201327\u00b0 43? N and Longitudes 30\u00b0 25\u201330\u00b0 53? E. The importance of this area increased after the\nconstruction of the Dayrout-Farafrah new road. This area was selected from the 1.5 million acre reclamation\nproject. Reclamation depends on groundwater occurrence. So, this research will focus on groundwater exploration.\nThe geoelectrical resistivity method was used for delineating of groundwater occurrence for recommending\nnew localities for drilling wells. Thirty-four Schlumberger Vertical Electrical Soundings (VES) have\nbeen carried out with a maximum half current electrode spacing of 700 m. Results of the interpretation through\nthe light of the Eocene aquifer characteristics along the study area indicates that the depth to water in Eocene\naquifer varying from 66 to 120 m. and the best area for drilling wells is located in the southwestern, central and\nsouthern parts of the study area, where minimum depth to water and maximum groundwater resistivity values\nwithin Eocene aquifer are well-represented.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Th.H.
