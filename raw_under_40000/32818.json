{"Nomor": 32818, "Judul": "Investigation of spectrum values in rural environments", "Abstrak": "Frequency bands above 1.5 GHz have traditionally been used for 3G and 4G mobile communication services and new frequency bands will\nbe allocated for 5G services in the near future. In this paper, the spectrum value in rural environments is analyzed using an engineering-economic\nmodeling. In order to evaluate the spectrum values, three metrics are selected: maximum cell radius, annual infrastructure cost per square kilometer,\nand spectrum value per MHz-POP. Frequency bands ranging from 1.5 GHz to 3 GHz and 3 GHz to 11 GHz, are evaluated.\n?c 2018 The Korean Institute of Communications and Information Sciences (KICS). Publishing Services by Elsevier B.V.
