{"Nomor": 32606, "Judul": "Characterization of the Kinetics and Mechanism of Degradation of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Laden Poly(ethylene glycol) Hydrogels", "Abstrak": "Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are\nmotile cells that migrate from their native niche to wounded\nsites where they regulate in\nfl\nammation during healing. New\nmaterials are being developed as hMSC delivery platforms to\nenhance wound healing. To act as an e\nff\nective wound healing\nmaterial, the hydrogel must degrade at the same rate as tissue\nregeneration, while maintaining a high cell viability. This work\ndetermines the kinetics and mechanism of cell-mediated\ndegradation in hMSC-laden poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)\nhydrogels. We use a well-established hydrogel sca\nff\nold that is\ncomposed of a backbone of four-arm star PEG functionalized with norbornene that is cross-linked with a matrix\nmetalloproteinase (MMP) degradable peptide. This peptide sequence is cleaved by cell-secreted MMPs, which allow hMSCs to\nactively degrade the hydrogel during motility. Three mechanisms of degradation are characterized: hydrolytic, noncellular\nenzymatic and cell-mediated degradation. We use bulk rheology to characterize hydrogel material properties and quantify\ndegradation throughout the entire reaction. Hydrolysis and noncellular enzymatic degradation are\nfi\nrst characterized in\nhydrogels without hMSCs, and follow\nfi\nrst-order and Michaelis\n?\nMenten kinetics, respectively. A high cell viability is measured\nin hMSC-laden hydrogels, even after shearing on the rheometer. After con\nfi\nrming hMSC viability, bulk rheology characterizes\ncell-mediated degradation. When comparing cell-mediated degradation to noncellular degradation mechanisms, cell-mediated\ndegradation is dominated by enzymatic degradation. This indicates hydrogels with hMSCs are degraded primarily due to cell-\nsecreted MMPs and very little network structure is lost due to hydrolysis. Modeling cell-mediated degradation provides an\nestimate of the initial concentration of MMPs secreted by hMSCs. By changing the concentration of hMSCs, we determine the\ninitial MMP concentration increases with increasing hMSC concentration. This work characterizes the rate and mechanism of\nsca\nff\nold degradation, giving new insight into the design of these materials as implantable sca\nff\nolds.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Michelle S.
