{"Nomor": 34364, "Judul": "Entrepreneurial manipulation with staged financing", "Abstrak": "Finance is staged in entrepreneurial settings. It has been argued that staging has a drawback: en- trepreneurs manipulate short-term appearances to keep funds flowing. In contrast, this paper finds that staging can lead to either more or less manipulation than non-staged finance. Finally, behavior in early rounds induces a kind of \u201cmanipulation persistence\u201dso that total manipulation is path-dependent. The model makes predictions regarding crowdsourced finance, switching of VCs, and lifecycle issues in en- trepreneurial finance.", "Daftar File": {"2018_EJRNL_CHRIS_YUNG_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/155860"}, "Penulis": "Chris Yung [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Matematika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Insurance", "Kata Kunci": "Venture capital Staging Fraud Manipulation Entrepreneurial finance", "Sumber": "Journal of Banking and Finance 0 0 0 (2018) 1\u201310", "Staf Input/Edit": "Dwi Ary Fuziastuti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Feb 2019"}
