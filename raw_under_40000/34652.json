{"Nomor": 34652, "Judul": "Design Rhetoric Studying the Effects of Designed Objects", "Abstrak": "Many of the ways in which artifacts appear to or actually do affect us as elegant, dynamic, comfortable, authentic are based on the fact that they are designed objects. Design is an effect-oriented process that resorts to design rules  linking  formal  aspects  of  designed  artifacts  to  specific  design  effects.  \nDesign rhetoric tries to capture these links between design techniques and resulting effects. This article presents design-rhetorical methods of identifying design rules of intersubjective validity. The new approach, developed at Bern University  of  the  Arts,  combines  rhetorical  design  analysis  with  practice oriented design research, based on the creation and empirical testing of design variants in accordance with effect hypotheses", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Annina Schneller [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "commercial graphics, design artifacts, design effects, design rhetoric, effect- oriented design, information design, practice-based design research, visual  rhetoric", "Sumber": "Nature & Culture.
