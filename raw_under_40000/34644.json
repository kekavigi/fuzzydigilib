{"Nomor": 34644, "Judul": "Semiotics of virtual reality as a communication process", "Abstrak": "The experience of immersive virtual reality (VR) can be considered as a communication process\nbetween human beings, mediated by computer systems, which uses visualisation and other\nsensory stimulation. In this paper, we analyse how VR characteristics can be explored using\nsemiotic theory and, with methods of generative semiotics, we explore aspects of narrative and\ninteraction in VR. We propose a semiotic analysis of VR communication focusing on syntax,\nsemantics and pragmatics and considering also some principles of generative semiotics. The\nsyntactic level is analysed as determined by the characteristics of the visual communication\nadopted. The semantic of VR is related to the functional model chosen to realise the virtual\nsystem. The pragmatic of VR is based on the human computer interaction that changes the user\u2019s role. We explore how these aspects can be characterised in the context of VR communication design and what principles can be adopted for a VR application, and we present an analysis and a classification of the iconic signs that are being used in VR. Moreover, we present a framework that can be used to classify and describe different kinds of virtual reality systems and to better understand communication in VR, and we use it to classify eight popular systems for e-learning and collaboration.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "B.
