{"Nomor": 33042, "Judul": "2D Synthetic Emitter Array methodology for improving GPR reflections", "Abstrak": "Synthetic 1D-arrays of emitters are used in the area of GPR to improve primary reflections that in single-offset\nprofiles show low continuity and amplitude due to the interference of clutter and noise. In this methodology,\nat each array position along the survey line, a series of single emitter-receivermeasurements is performed, keeping\nthe position of the receiver constant and placing consecutively the emitter at the positions of the nodes of the\narray grid. A definite phase relation between the traces that constitute each common receiver gather is\nestablished and used to shift themin timewith respect to the reference-offset trace, and the results are averaged.\nThe phase relations are defined in order to superpose constructively the primary reflections, and reduce the random\nnoise and clutter. The 1D synthetic procedure is equivalent to narrowing the transmitted electromagnetic\nwave-front along the direction of a real 1D array, which reduces the interference produced by reflectors located\nin formerly illuminated regions of the soil, and directing the field along an emitters-reflector-receiver path that\nmaximizes the amplitude of the primary reflection at the position of the receiver with respect to the other\nreflections.\nIn this article, a previously developed 1D-array method is extended to 2D-arrays, and the results of the 2D extension\nare analyzed and compared to the results of the 1D-array, Common-Midpoint and Single Offset techniques.\nThe proposed 2D procedure considers a rectangular, homogeneous geometry for the array and a simple phaserelation\nbetween the component traces. In addition to directing thewave-front towards the target, these settings\nmake possible to reduce the width of the wave-front along both axes of the array, which is expected to enhance\nthe 1D results. Since the dimensionality increases in the 2D geometry, the number of traces in the summation\ngrows significantly, which should also improve the final result. As a part of the 2D methodology, a variable\nthat represents the reflection improvement, with respect to the Single Offset method, is defined and optimized\nas a function of the phase differences between adjacent traces along both directions of the array and the position\nof the emitters-receiver group along the survey line. A final data-section is generated from the optimal values\nfound in this step. To evaluate the results of thesemethodologies, two basic types of reflections are analyzed: diffractions\nproduced by small objects and reflections at extensive interfaces. Numerical and laboratory data are\nconsidered. The effects of different numbers of emitters and distances between them on the results are investigated,\nin order to obtain the best result. The 2D method shows noticeable enhancements of the continuity and\namplitude of the primary reflection with respect to the other methods.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Dar\u00edo Bullo [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["N\u00e9stor Bonomo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "GPR Synthetic Emitter Array Phased Array Reflection improvement Clutter Noise", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 159 (2018) 285\u2013293, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.08.005", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Jan 2019"}
