{"Nomor": 34842, "Judul": "Effective treatment of reverse osmosis concentrate from incineration leachate using direct contact membrane distillation coupled with a NaOH/PAM pre-treatment process", "Abstrak": "Reverse osmosis is frequently used to process biologically treated leachate from municipal solid waste\nincineration plants. Reverse osmosis concentrate from incineration leachate (ROCIL) contains extremely\nhigh concentrations of monovalent and divalent ions (e.g. Na\u00fe, K\u00fe, Mg2\u00fe, and Ca2\u00fe) and some refractory\norganic pollutants (e.g. humic substances). In this study, lab-scale direct contact membrane distillation\n(DCMD) coupled with pre-treatment was applied to treat ROCIL. NaOH and polyacrylamide (PAM)\nchemical precipitation and coagulation pretreatment effectively removed Ca2\u00fe and Mg2\u00fe (>99%) from\nthe ROCIL, which also significantly improved the treatment efficiency of DCMD and slowed down\nmembrane fouling caused by Mg5(CO3)4(OH)2$4H2O and CaCO3 scaling on the membrane surface. During\nthe long-term operation of DCMD, ROCIL was concentrated 21 times and nearly all of the inorganic ions\n(>99.9%) and organic matter (>99%) were removed from the pre-treated ROCIL. A strong interaction\noccurred due to the accumulation of humic substances and metal ions in the feed solution, which lead to\ninorganic and organic scaling deposited on the membrane surface and pores, but the wetting phenomenon was not serious. These results demonstrated that DCMD coupled with NaOH/PAM pretreatment can be a potential alternative for further treatment and concentration of ROCIL to obtain\nhigh quality water.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jinyu Shi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yan Dang., Dan Qu.,Dezhi Sun"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Incineration leachate Reverse osmosis concentrate Direct contact membrane distillation Pre-treatment Membrane fouling", "Sumber": "Chemosphere 220 (2019) 195-203", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Feb 2019"}
