{"Nomor": 34424, "Judul": "Collaborative application of computer technology in  interior design", "Abstrak": "Computer-aided  indoor  design  is  a  communication-dense  process.  In  the  design, \ncomputer technology is usually needed to realize mutual data interaction, feedback and coordination \nas  well  as  promote  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  indoor  design  through  the  correlation  of data. \nTherefore,  from  the  perspective  of  computer  supported  environment,  the  paper  puts  forward  the \nmost  explicit  requirements  on  cooperative  design,  i.e., by  adopting  a  series  of  software,  such  as CAD,  Revit,  BIM  and  so  on,  under  the  technological background  of  computer  supported \ncooperative work, the paper improves the maintenance and updating of each link in the design and \nconstruction  process,  thus  leading  to  a  great  and  overall  leap  of  indoor  design  based  on  the \nbidirectional associations between computer technology and cooperative design.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xuguang Yang   [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jian Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Computer technology ?
