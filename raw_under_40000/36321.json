{"Nomor": 36321, "Judul": "Occurrence of coliphage in raw wastewater and in ambient water: A meta-analysis", "Abstrak": "Coliphage have been proposed as indicators of fecal contamination in recreational waters because they\nbetter reflect the persistence of pathogenic viruses in the environment and through wastewater treatment than traditional fecal indicator bacteria. Herein, we conducted a systematic literature search of\npeer-reviewed publications to identify coliphage density data (somatic and male-specific, or MSC) in raw\nwastewater and ambient waters. The literature review inclusion criteria included scope, study quality,\nand data availability. A non-parametric two-stage bootstrap analysis was used to estimate the coliphage\ndistributions in raw wastewater and account for geographic region and season. Additionally, two statistical methodologies were explored for developing coliphage density distributions in ambient waters,\nto account for the nondetects in the datasets. In raw wastewater, the analysis resulted in seasonal density\ndistributions of somatic coliphage (SC) (mean 6.5 log10 plaque forming units (PFU)/L; 95% confidence\ninterval (CI): 6.2e6.8) and MSC (mean 5.9 log10 PFU/L; 95% CI: 5.5e6.1). In ambient waters, 49% of MSC\nsamples were nondetects, compared with less than 5% for SC. Overall distributional estimates of ambient\ndensities of coliphage were statistically higher for SC than for MSC (mean 3.4 and 1.0 log10 PFU/L,\nrespectively). Distributions of coliphage in raw wastewater and ambient water will be useful for future\nmicrobial risk assessments.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Sharon P.
