{"Nomor": 36214, "Judul": "Integrated petrophysics and rock physics modeling for well log interpretation of elastic, electrical, and petrophysical properties", "Abstrak": "Rock and fluid volumetric properties, such as porosity, saturation, and mineral volumes, are generally estimated\nfrom petrophysical measurements such as density, resistivity, neutron porosity and gamma ray, through\npetrophysical equations. The computed petrophysical properties and sonic log measurements are generally\nused to estimate the petro-elastic relationship between elastic and rock and fluid volumetric properties used\nin reservoir characterization. In this paper, we present a unified workflow that includes petrophysical relations\nand rock physics models for the estimation of rock and fluid properties from elastic, electrical, and petrophysical\n(porosity, density, and lithology) measurements. The multi-physics model we propose has the advantage of accounting for the coupled effect of rock and fluid properties in the joint petro-elastic and electrical domains, and\npotentially reduce the uncertainty in the well log interpretation. Furthermore, the presented workflow can be\neventually extended to three-dimensional reservoir characterization problems, where seismic and electromagnetic data are available. To demonstrate the validity of the methodology, we show the application of this\nmulti-physics model to both laboratory measurements and well log data.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Wenting Wu  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dario Grana"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Petrophysics Rock physics Multiphysics model Formation evaluation Reservoir characterization", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 146 (2017) 54\u201366, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.09.007", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Mar 2019"}
