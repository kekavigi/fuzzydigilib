Both of the sunk costs and current costs are computed,\nand an improved housing affordability index is used to measure the levels of housing affordability in\ncities in China.\nFindings \u2013 The total net benefits of this policy are estimated to range from $234,176.7 million to\n\u00a5271,020.4 million. The costs are divided into sunk costs and current costs, computed to be\n\u00a5447,598.63 million and \u00a5328,685.21 million, respectively. The supply size of affordable dwellings is\nfar from adequate due to the low level of housing affordability in China.\nResearch limitations/implications \u2013 The data in this study is insufficient and some information\nsuch as the income of occupiers has yet to be estimated. However, if more individual data was\navailable, the conclusion would be confidential.\nPractical implications \u2013 From this paper the policymakers may understand how to estimate the\nwelfare efficiency of affordable housing policy, adjust the participant regulations and determine the\nsupply of affordable houses.\nOriginality/value \u2013 This paper estimates the benefits and costs of China\u2019s affordable housing\nprogram as the first study in this area. The Cobb-Douglas utility function was used in the analysis of\nChina\u2019s housing policy", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yi Niu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Housing, Public policy, China", "Sumber": "https://search.proquest.com/docview/232425950/fulltextPDF/3009DFD7E79F4A4BPQ/8?accountid=31562", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Mei 2019"}
