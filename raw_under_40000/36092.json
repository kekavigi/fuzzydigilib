{"Nomor": 36092, "Judul": "Ultrapure Wood Nanocellulose?Assessments of Coagulation andInitial Inflammation Potential", "Abstrak": "Using a lepirudin-based human whole blood model, we evaluated the initial inflammatory and coagulationresponses of dense and porous ultrapure (<50 endotoxin units/grams) cellulose nanofibrils (CNF), of carboxylated grade. TheCNF was compared to the wound dressing AquaCel because it is a potential wound-healing material. The porous CNF aerogelsinduced the strongest coagulation potential measured as prothrombin factor 1.2 (PTF1.2). AquaCel induced the strongestcomplement response by terminal complement complex (TCC) and surface C3c. All materials activated leukocytes CD11b,while the levels of only 3 of 27 cytokines were significantly changed, limited to (i) an elevation of the monocyte chemoattractantprotein-1 (MCP-1/CCL) by the CNF aerogel, (ii) a reduction of eosinophil chemotactic proteins (eotaxin/CCL11) by theCNF aerogel, and (iii) a reduction of platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) by all CNF materials. In conclusion, theCNF materials and AquaCel differently activate coagulation, complement, and cytokines, improving the selection possibilities invarious treatment situations of wound healing.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Henriette_R__Nordli_11.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/161595"}, "Penulis": "Henriette R.
