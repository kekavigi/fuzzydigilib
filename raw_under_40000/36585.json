It seeks to minimize the negative environmental impact of\nbuildings by enhancing efficiency, local and sustainable materials, and develop opportunities for improvements\nwithin buildings structure. The aim of the present paper is to understand how to encourage more affordable ecohousing\nby learning from examples at home and overseas. The aim of the research were to identify successful\nexamples of low cost eco-housing across a variety of different environments and contexts, understand how such\ndevelopments have overcome the problems they faced (such as planning, local resistance, finance, or using nonconventional\nmaterials), and identify common successful strategies in creating affordable eco-homes which could be\nadopted even in Romania.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "LARISA MUNTEAN [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["BOGDAN CIORU?A"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Architecture", "Kata Kunci": "sustainable architecture, affordable eco-buidings, eco-design, low impact.", "Sumber": "Scientific Bulletin of North University Center of Baia Mare Series D, Mining, Mineral Processing, Non-ferrous Metallurgy, Geology and Environmental Engineering Volume XXX No. 2, 2016", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Mar 2019"}
