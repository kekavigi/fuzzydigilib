{"Nomor": 32449, "Judul": "Warm-Season Diurnal Variations of Total, Stratiform, Convective, and Extreme Hourly Precipitation over Central and Eastern China", "Abstrak": "ABSTRACT\nDiurnal variations in amount, frequency and intensity of warm-season hourly precipitation (HP) at seven levels, which are\ndefined as HP  0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 mm, are revealed based on no less than 30 years of hourly rain-gauge observations\nat national stations over central and eastern China (CEC). This study investigates the variations, relationships, differences and\nsimilarities of total, stratiform, convective and extreme HP over the entire CEC and various subregions. Results indicate that\nthe variations in the amount and frequency of HP at the seven levels over the entire CEC all display a bimodal feature. For\nvarious regions, the variations of total HP mostly feature two peaks, while convective HP mainly occurs in the late afternoon\nand determines the diurnal variation of total HP intensity. On the basis of the primary peak time periods of HP frequency\nat all levels over different subregions, the variations can be classified into three main categories: late-afternoon primary\npeak, nocturnal primary peak, and time-shifting primary peak. However, the variations over some coastal regions like the\nLiaodong Peninsula, the Shandong Peninsula, and the coastal regions of Guangdong, distinctly differ from those over their\ncorresponding larger regions. Overall, the normalized diurnal variation amplitude of amount and frequency increases with\nthe increasing HP intensity; convective precipitation can be represented by HP  10 mm; and the intensity of HP  50 mm is\nslightly larger during the nighttime than during the daytime over the entire CEC. In northern China, diurnal variation in HP\n 5 mm can represent well that in convective precipitation.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "YONGGUAN ZHENG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yanduo GONG", "Jiong CHEN1", "Fuyou TIAN"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "diurnal variation, total precipitation, stratiform precipitation, convective precipitation, extreme precipitation", "Sumber": "ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, VOL. 36, FEBRUARY 2019, 143\u2013159", "Staf Input/Edit": "SYSTEM \u00a0\n                                     Rita Nurainni, S.I.Pus", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
