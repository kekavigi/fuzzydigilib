{"Nomor": 35001, "Judul": "The Prospect of Electrochemical Technologies Advancing Worldwide Water Treatment", "Abstrak": "Growing worldwide population, climate\nchange, and decaying water infrastructure have all contributed\nto a need for a better water treatment and conveyance model.\nDistributed water treatment is one possible solution, which\nrelies on the local treatment of water from various sources to a\ndegree dependent on its intended use and, finally, distribution\nto local consumers. This distributed, fit-for-purpose water\ntreatment strategy requires the development of new modular\npoint-of-use and point-of-entry technologies to bring this idea\nto fruition. Electrochemical technologies have the potential to\ncontribute to this vision, as they have several advantages over\nestablished water treatment technologies....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Brian P.
