{"Nomor": 34767, "Judul": "As An Approach To Improving Creativity In Design Education;  Art  Of Painting", "Abstrak": "Not  just  watched,  a  work  of  art  can  be  experienced  in  transforming  spaces.  Living  in  concrete  works  of  abstract  art,  also  strengthens  the  link  between  the  past  and  the  present.  Thus,  while  the  art  works  are  introduced  to  people,  everyone  will  be  informed  about  the  works  and  the  artist.  Everyone,  including  those  who  can\u2019t  afford  art  Works  will  be  provided  spaces  transformed into them. This approach is applied for three hours a week in the 14-week Design Detail course at KTU, Department of  Landscape  Architecture.  16X3  works  by  Paul  Klee,  Wassily  Kandisky  and  Johannes  Itten  were  selected  by  the  instructor.  Every student selected one of them to study. The basic approach required from the students was to design functionally suitable \nand sensitive spaces just in accordance with the design elements of these works. Firstly, a space reading was conducted with each student. Later, transitions began from two-dimensional works to \nthree- dimensional spaces. At last, starting with the works of art, the students designed children\u2019s play grounds, festival areas, coastal parks, urban open spaces, rural open spaces, labyrinths and \nwalls. The study provided all students useful knowledge about Bauhaus school of art and architecture and philosophy, its three distinguished artists, and their forty-eight works and understanding of art. Therefore, this approach interpreting art works and the art is considered to be important for the education of qualified landscape architectures and the creation of a qualified and liveable environment.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "AYSEL YAVUZ [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Creativity, design, art, painting", "Sumber": "Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 141 ( 2014 ) 741 \u2013 747", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Feb 2019"}
