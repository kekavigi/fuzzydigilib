{"Nomor": 34509, "Judul": "A profit maximising product line optimisation model under monopolistic competition", "Abstrak": "Existing research on product line optimisation have focused mainly on designing a product line based on the trade-offs between sellers\u2019and buyers\u2019utility, without any explicit consideration of the underlying market structure. A few studies can be found that consider the monopolists\u2019optimal product line offering. In this study, we examine the optimal product line decision of an entrant firm under monopolistic competitive markets. Specifically, we develop a mathematical programming formulation of an entrant firm\u2019s problem of deciding on the market segments to enter and the correspond-\ning product designs to offer, to maximise its profit. A heuristic has been presented for solving the resulting mixed integernon-linear programming problem. The specifications of the problem increase exponentially with the size of the problem and as such, commercial solvers are not useful for solving a generalised instance. A small example has been presented and solved using both the heuristic and the ILOG CPLEX 10.2. Both result in identical solutions. We attempt an explanation on why the heuristic gives an optimal solution.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Soumojit Kumar [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ashis Kumar Chatterjee"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "product design; multi-attribute; quality type attribute; heuristics", "Sumber": "International Journal of Production Research , 2015 Vol. 53, No. 5, 1584 \u2013 1595,", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Feb 2019"}
