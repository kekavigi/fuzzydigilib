{"Nomor": 33651, "Judul": "WHAT TO WATCH FOR IN 2019", "Abstrak": "The world\u2019s largest radio telescope\u2014 China\u2019s Five-hundred-meter. Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope \u2014 should be fully operational and available to researchers from September. Since the start of its\ncommissioning phase in 2016, the 1.2-billion-yuan (US$170-million) mega-telescope has spotted more than 50 new pulsars: dense, rapidly spinning dead stars. It will soon hunt for the faint signals that emerge\nfrom phenomena such as fast radio bursts and clouds of cosmic gas. Meanwhile, astronomers will decide whether to press ahead with building the Thirty Meter Telescope on the Hawaiian mountain Mauna Kea. In 2018, the plans cleared the last of a long series of legal challenges lodged by locals. ?", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ELIZABETH GIBNEY [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Astronomi", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Kosmik", "Sumber": "3 JANUARY 2019 | VOL 565 | NATURE", "Staf Input/Edit": "pustaka bosscha", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Jan 2019"}
