{"Nomor": 38416, "Judul": "Time-dependent Hartree-Fock plus Langevin approach for hot fusion reactions to synthesize the Z = 120 superheavy element", "Abstrak": "We develop a novel approach to fusion reactions for synthesis of superheavy elements, which combines\nthe time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) method with a dynamical diffusion model based on the Langevin equation. In this approach, the distance of the closest approach for the capture process is estimated within the TDHF approach, which is then plugged into the dynamical diffusion model as an initial condition. We apply this approach to hot fusion reactions leading to formation of the element Z = 120, that is, the 48Ca + 254,257Fm, 51V + 249Bk, and 54Cr + 248Cm reactions. Our calculations indicate that the distances of the closest approach for these systems are similar to each other and thus the difference in the probabilities of evaporation residue formation among those reaction systems originates mainly from the evaporation process, which is sensitive to the fission barrier height and the excitation energy of a compound nucleus.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "K.
