{"Nomor": 32451, "Judul": "Exploitation of Parthenium hysterophorous biomass as low-cost substrate for cellulase and xylanase production under solid-state fermentation using Talaromyces stipitatus MTCC 12687", "Abstrak": "To make the enzyme production process appreciably inexpensive in respect of SSF, use of economical\nsubstrates is of great interest. Out of total eight employed solid substrate, Parthenium hysterophorous\nbiomass exhibited its potential and displayed maximum endoglucanase (30 IU/gds), xylanase (582 IU/\ngds) and FPase (2.86 FPU/gds) activities. During optimization of cultural parameters, Talaromyces stipitatus\nMTCC 12687 produced maximum endoglucanase (53.3 IU/gds), FPase (4.51 FPU/gds) and bglucosidase\n(62.6 IU/gds) at temperature (30 C), incubation time (5th day), pH (6.0) and moisture content\n(80%) with the supplementation of peptone as the nitrogen source and Tween-80 as the surfactant under\nSSF conditions. During the process of optimization different enzyme activities viz. endoglucanase,\nxylanase, FPase and b-glucosidase were enhanced by approximately 2.0, 1.54, 2.0 and 2.7 fold respectively\ncompared to their respective controls. Talaromyces stipitatus MTCC 12687 enzymes hydrolysed\nuntreated and organosolve pretreated P. hysterophorous biomass to release 93 \u00b1 3.87 and734 \u00b1 17 mg/g of\nreducing sugars respectively after hydrolysis time of 48 h.\n\u00a9 2018 The Egyptian Society of Radiation Sciences and Applications.
