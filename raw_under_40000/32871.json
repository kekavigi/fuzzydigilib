{"Nomor": 32871, "Judul": "Seismic attenuation estimation using the modified log spectral ratio method", "Abstrak": "The quality factor Q is one of the key parameters in designing an inverse Q filter to improve seismic time\nresolution and used a direct hydrocarbon indicator. In this paper, we propose a modified log spectral\nratio (MLSR) method to estimate the quality factor from seismic CMP gathers. Our workflow assumes\nthat the source wavelet can be simulated by a mixed phase wavelet (MPW). We first deduce a modified\nlog spectral ratio (MLSR) method to estimate the quality factor from seismic CMP gathers. We next obtain the quality factor by comparing the ratio of log spectral of different offsets within the same CMP\ngather. To demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, we first apply it to\nsynthetic gathers and then a real seismic data to estimate the quality factor Q. Both applications illustrate that the Q quality factor estimated using our method is superior to that obtained from the selected\ncomparing methods.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Naihao Liu  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Bo Zhang, Jinghuai Gao, Zhaoqi Gao, Shengjun Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Quality factor Log spectral ratio Mixed phase wavelet Pre-stack CMP gather", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 159 (2018) 386\u2013394, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.09.014", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Jan 2019"}
