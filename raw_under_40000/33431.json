{"Nomor": 33431, "Judul": "COLLOQUIUM : STRONG-FIELD PHENOMENA IN PERIODIC SYSTEMS", "Abstrak": "The advent of visible-infrared laser pulses carrying a substantial fraction of their energy in a single\nfield oscillation cycle has opened a new era in the experimental investigation of ultrafast processes\nin semiconductors and dielectrics (bulk as well as nanostructured), motivated by the quest for the\nultimate frontiers of electron-based signal metrology and processing. Exploring ways to approach\nthose frontiers requires insight into the physics underlying the interaction of strong high-frequency\n(optical) fields with electrons moving in periodic potentials. This Colloquium aims at providing this\ninsight. Introduction to the foundations of strong-field phenomena defines and compares regimes\nof field-matter interaction in periodic systems, including (perfect) crystals as well as optical and\nsemiconductor superlattices, followed by a review of recent experimental advances in the study of\nstrong-field dynamics in crystals and nanostructures. Avenues toward measuring and controlling\nelectronic processes up to petahertz frequencies are discussed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "STANISLAV YU.
