{"Nomor": 33158, "Judul": "Random noise attenuation by 3D Multi-directional vector median filter", "Abstrak": "Noise attenuation is an important data processing step in exploration geophysics,which is used to extract useful\ninformation or improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR) from the raw measurements. The vector median filter\n(VMF), as an extension of the scalar median filter (SMF), can efficiently suppress randomnoise and preserve discontinuities\nof the spreading structures within the data, but it faces questions of how to define a minimum distance\nand what appropriate additional constraints should be introduced for a reasonable unique median-output\nvector. Additionally, to avoid uncertainty in data processing using the 2D-VMF method and to more reasonably\ndescribe the 3D seismic cube, this study introduces a 3Dmulti-directional VMF. The new3D-MDVMF method primarily\nconsists of two steps: 1) detecting the main local dip using some trial angles with a similarity judgement\nand 2) applying the filter with the constraints for noise suppression and structure enhancement. Synthetic simulated\ndata and marine data are tested. The results show that the proposed method can enhance local dip detection,\nseparate the random noise, and well preserve discontinuities of the structures. This method might be\nsignificant for general noise attenuation for data containing spreading structure", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Shaojiang Wu  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yibo Wanga, Zhixin Di, Xu Changa"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Noise attenuation Median filter Seismic data Multi-directional operator", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 159 (2018) 277\u2013284, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.09.021", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "16 Jan 2019"}
