{"Nomor": 38599, "Judul": "Detecting Interactions between Nanomaterials and Cell Membranes by Synthetic Nanopores", "Abstrak": "Engineered nanomaterials have been increasingly\nutilized in industry for various consumer products, environmental\ntreatments, energy storage, and biomedical applications. Meanwhile, it\nhas been established that certain nanomaterials can be toxic to\nbiological cells from extensive experimental and theoretical studies.\nDespite that the exact molecular mechanisms of this nanomaterial\ntoxicity are still not well understood, it is ubiquitous that their\ninteractions with cell membranes, through either endocytosis or\npenetration (and thus potential lysis), act as the first step toward the\ninflammation or even the death of a cell. To facilitate the study of\nnanomaterial?membrane interactions, here we demonstrate a nanopore-based single-molecule approach that can be\napplied to monitor a specific nanomaterial?membrane interaction in real time. Combined with molecular dynamics and\nexperimental approaches, we show how an ionic current can be used to detect membrane damage by a graphene nanosheet\nand illustrate the underlying molecular mechanism. More generally, we expect that measured transmembrane ionic currents\n(both DC and AC) can signify many particle-induced membrane modifications, such as hole formation, particle adsorption,\nand protein insertion.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Binquan Luan 1.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170032"}, "Penulis": "Binquan Luan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Shuo Zhou, Deqiang Wang, Ruhong Zhou"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "bionano, nanotoxicity, nanopore, biosensor, membrane damage, graphene, nanomaterials", "Sumber": "ACS Nano 2017, 11, 12615?12623", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Mei 2019"}
