{"Nomor": 37144, "Judul": "Investigation on the Interaction of HNP-1 and HNP-2 Defensins with POPE/POPG Mixed-Lipid in Membrane-Bound Structure: A Molecular Dynamics Study", "Abstrak": "Human defensins are antimicrobial peptide produced by the innate host\ndefense in response to the bacteria, fungi, viruses, and mycobacterium inva-\nsion. Human neutrophil peptides (HNPs) 1 and 2 are the most potent forms\nof human -defensins against the tested microbes in experimental researches.\nThey can kill the pathogen through the membrane disruption mechanism. It\nis known that HNP1 and HNP2 show a commensurate potential against the\ngram-positive strain. However, HNP2 appeared to be more potent against the\ngram-negative bacteria than HNP1. The inner membrane of gram-negative\nbacteria contains phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylglycerol\n(PG) molecules as mixture lipids. In this study, we investigate the eect\nof HNP1 and HNP2 binding to the POPE/POPG mixed-lipid bilayers on the\nstructure and stability of the protein and lipid, through the molecular dynam-\nics simulation. We apply the wedge model for the membrane-bound structure,\nwhich suggests that the dimer inserts into the bilayer with the hydrophobic\nbottom contacting the hydrocarbon region of the membrane. The 3:1 lipid\nproportion of POPE and POPG is used as a model of the Escherichia coli\nmembrane. We compare the microbial actions of HNP1 and HNP2 by analyz-\ning the lipid structure changes due to the interaction between the hydrophobic\nresidues of the peptide with the lipid tails. The membrane analyses show that\nthe presence of HNPs has signicantly aect the lipid structure, shown by the\ndecrease of area/lipid and the increase of the POPE/POPG bilayer thickness.\nHowever, the interaction of HNP1 with the membrane in the binding structure\naects the lipid structure in nearly similar term to the interaction of HNP2\nwith the membrane.", "Daftar File": {"2014_TS_PP_NANDIA_PRIMASARI_1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/163729", "2014_TS_PP_NANDIA_PRIMASARI_1-BAB_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/163731", "2014_TS_PP_NANDIA_PRIMASARI_1-BAB_2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/163733", "2014_TS_PP_NANDIA_PRIMASARI_1-BAB_3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/163734", "2014_TS_PP_NANDIA_PRIMASARI_1-BAB_4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/163735", "2014_TS_PP_NANDIA_PRIMASARI_1-BAB_5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/163736", "2014_TS_PP_NANDIA_PRIMASARI_1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/163737"}, "Penulis": "Nandia Primasari [20912019]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Drs.
