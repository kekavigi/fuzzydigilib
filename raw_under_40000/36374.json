In this work, we suggest a chemical methodology ofsynthesizing silicon?carbon composite anodes, with capacity values of 763 and 182 mAh/g at current densities of 0.1 and 5 A/g, respectively. An electrostatic assembly technique is designed to be triggered by a cationic polyelectrolyte, poly(ethylenimine),for negatively charged silicon nanoparticles and graphene oxides. Amine-functionalized carbon nanotubes are synthesized in anondestructive fashion and incorporated additionally to provide intraconnected conductive pathways between neighboringcomposite materials. It is revealed that the electrochemical performance of intraconnected composite materials is determined bythe chemical/physical factors of constituent compartments. The applicability toward all-solid-state batteries is also suggestedwith usage of a solid polymer electrolyte synthesized from a mixture of bisphenol A ethoxylate diacrylate, polyethylene glycoldimethyl ether,tert-butyl peroxypivalate, and bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Changju_Chae_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/162090"}, "Penulis": "Changju Chae [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Woonghee Choi,Seulgi Ji,Sun Sook Lee,Jin-Kyu Kim,Sungho Choi,Yongku Kang,Youngmin Choi,Do Youb Kim,Sunho Jeong"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "silicon, carbon, electrostatic, amine,flexible, battery", "Sumber": "ACSAppl.EnergyMater.XXXX, XXX, XXX?XXX", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Mar 2019"}
