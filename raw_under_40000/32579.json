{"Nomor": 32579, "Judul": "EXTREME ASYMMETRY IN METASURFACES VIA EVANESCENT FIELDS ENGINEERING: ANGULAR-ASYMMETRIC ABSORPTION", "Abstrak": "On the quest towards full control over wave propagation, the development of compact devices that allow\nasymmetric response is a challenge. In this Letter, we introduce a new paradigm for the engineering of\nasymmetry in planar structures, revealing and exploiting unilateral excitation of evanescent waves. We test\nthe idea with the design and experimental characterization of a metasurface for angular-asymmetric\nabsorption. The results show that the contrast ratio of absorption (the asymmetry level) can be arbitrarily\nengineered from zero to infinity for waves coming from two oppositely tilted angles. We demonstrate that\nthe revealed asymmetry effects cannot be realized using conventional diffraction gratings, reflectarrays, and\nphase-gradient metasurfaces. This Letter opens up promising possibilities for wave manipulation via\nevanescent waves engineering with applications in one-side detection and sensing, angle-encoded\nsteganography, flat nonlinear devices, and shaping the scattering patterns of various objects.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "XUCHEN WANG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["ANA D\u00cdAZ-RUBIO", "VIKTAR S.
