{"Nomor": 34723, "Judul": "Introduction of one efficient industrial system for turpentine processing wastewater reuse and treatment", "Abstrak": "Wastewater treatment is one important issue for turpentine plant and more wastewater generated by greater\nturpentine processing will prevent its further development. To solve this issue without extra place and new\nequipment, one industrial system for reuse and treatment of turpentine processing wastewater was introduced\nfor the first time. For wastewater reuse, the technology was simple and easy to control that after neutralization by\nlime and absorption with activated carbon (optional, mostly not necessary), the wastewater could be reused for\nturpentine processing. After reuse, the wastewater was further treated by a biological system. During long-term\napplication of wastewater reuse in this plant, it showed little influence on the products performance (mainly acid\nvalue) and final wastewater COD. Base on above advantages, the plant could decide when for wastewater drainage, and thus the amount of wastewater was reduced greatly. For the biological treatment, the COD of wastewater could be degraded to suitable level stably and the wastewater after treatment could be applied for daily life in\nthe plant. Overall, considering the cost, operation, and performance, the whole system shows great potential and\npossibility of industrial application and therefore can be applied widely in the turpentine processing industry.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Chao Huang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Fen Peng., Lian Xiong.,Hai-Long Li.,Xue-Fang Chen.,Cheng Zhao.,Xin-De Chen"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Turpentine processing wastewater Wastewater reuse Neutralization Absorption Biological treatment Industrial application", "Sumber": "Science of the Total Environment 663 (2019) 447\u2013452", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Feb 2019"}
