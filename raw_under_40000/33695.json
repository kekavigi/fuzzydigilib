{"Nomor": 33695, "Judul": "Tertiary Hydrothermal Activity And Its Efect On Reservoir Properties In The Xihu Depression, East China Sea", "Abstrak": "Three large-scale episodes of volcanic activity occurred during the Tertiary in the Xihu Depression, located in the East China\nSea. Intermediate-felsic magmas intruded along faults and the associated hydrothermal fuids resulted in the hydrothermal\nalteration of the clastic country rock. To better describe reservoir characteristics, reservoir samples were subjected to the\nfollowing investigations: thin section examination, scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive spectrometer analysis\n(SEM\u2013EDS), fuid inclusion homogenization temperature tests, vitrinite refectance measurements, and X-ray difraction. The\nresults of this study provide evidence of the following hydrothermal alteration phenomena: brittle fracturing, clastic particle\nalteration, precipitation of unique hydrothermal minerals (celestite, zircon, apatite, barite, and cerous phosphate). The presence of abnormally high temperatures is indicated by fuid inclusion analysis, the precipitation of high-temperature authigenic\nminerals such as quartz, illite alteration, and anomalous vitrinite refectance. Two aspects related to hydrothermal efects\non reservoir properties have been investigated in this study: (1) Deep magmatic hydrothermal fuids carry large amounts of\ndissolved carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide gas. These fuids percolate into the country rocks along fault zones, resulting\nin dissolution within the sandstone reservoirs and the development of signifcant secondary porosity. (2) Magma intrusions\nincrease the temperature of the surrounding rocks and accelerate the thermal evolution of hydrocarbon source rocks. This\nresults in the release of large amounts of organic acids and carbon dioxide, leading the dissolution of the aluminosilicate\nminerals and volcanic fragments in the reservoirs, and the generation of signifcant secondary porosity.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "YAN LIU [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Si Ding Jin", "Qian Cao", "Wen Zhou"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Hydrothermal activities, Erosion effects, Clastic rock reservoir, Secondary porosity, Xihu Depression", "Sumber": "Petroleum Science (2019) 16:14\u201331 https://doi.org/10.1007/s12182-018-0292-4", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Jan 2019"}
