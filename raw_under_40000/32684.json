SABDI comprises 13 items. Based on\nprevious research studies and the history of science, the 38 distractors of SABDI were designed to reflect\nthe following four categories of possible misconceptions: (a) direct and (b) incorrect emergent views of\nsound; (c) explanations based on a device\u2019s salient feature; and (d) wrong applications of physics\nknowledge. Field testing carried out on 159 participants showed the salient features category to be the most\npopular. SABDI is a valid and reliable tool that could be used to determine students\u2019 thinking regarding\nacoustic devices.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ALEXANDER VOLFSON [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["HAIM ESHACH,", "AND YUVAL BEN-ABU"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "AMERICAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Des 2018"}
