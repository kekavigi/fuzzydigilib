{"Nomor": 38349, "Judul": "The \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdspirit of living continuity\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd? Revisiting the urban vision, methodologies and influence of the Studies in Conservation", "Abstrak": "The late 1960s witnessed sustained debate about the prevailing direction of policy towards the existing\nbuilt environment. Against that background, an initiative launched in 1966 saw small teams of consultants commissioned to prepare analytic and advisory reports on Bath, Chester, Chichester and York.\nTheir reports were belatedly published between February and May 1969. They were intended not just to\nprovide specific information about four cathedral cities but also collectively to act as pilot studies able\nto indicate more generally the options available to policymakers. In this paper, we make use of oral\ntestimony, archive sources and contemporary commentaries to identify the origins and purpose of this\ninitiative, discuss the intrinsic visions offered for the different cities, and comment on the methodologies\nproposed for achieving conservation. The final section provides historiographic commentary on the\nsignificance of the Studies in Conservation half a century after their publication", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "John R.
