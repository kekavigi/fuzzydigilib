{"Nomor": 38293, "Judul": "Strategy of textile design: Use of design methodology tools  in the creative process", "Abstrak": "This paper is based on the study of the application of the tools of design methodology in technological textile products also called smart fabrics. The application of the design methodology in the creative process took place in a textile factory by checking the contributions to the creativity, innovation, and quality. The purpose of studying the design practices in the use of resources and methods  of  the  textile  contributes  to  the  development  of  the  product  and  also  meets  the  needs  of customers.  In  this  context,  modifications were necessary to the development tools in the creative process that may cause the best use, reduction and cost containment  improving  the  overall  quality  and  meeting  customers\u2019  needs.  There  is  much  talk  about  making  products,  refining  and improving, but there is hardly any detailed application on how to carry it out, what parameters are used to such an achievement  and  what  solutions  are  applied  to  the  design  process.  The  application  in  creative  processes  and  product  design  follows  parameters that are often provided by customers. The concepts that are linked to these product development processes, and the understanding of their purpose helps reveal the customers\u2019 needs.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Sandra Helena da Silva de Santis [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Santis Franco Giuseppe Dedini"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "design methodology, creative process, textile design", "Sumber": "Strategic Design Research Journal, 10(1): 57-66 January-April 2017", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Mei 2019"}
