This study aimed to build a priority assessment method in determining green open space location based on characteristics of Banjarbaru City. GIS-based mapping analysis was executed from satellite imagery to determine land cover types, vegetation density (NDVI), and temperature humidity index (THI) as indicators. They were overlaid together with population density and land price. Scoring analysis was used to select the highest priority area to build new green open space. This method is also applicable to other tropical cities.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "NIDA HUMAIDA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Lilik Budi Prasetyo.", "Siti Badriyah Rushayati"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Banjarbaru, green open space, remote sensing, THI, urban heat island", "Sumber": "Procedia Environmental Sciences 33 ( 2016 ) 354 \u2013 364", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yoninur Almira", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
