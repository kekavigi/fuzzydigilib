{"Nomor": 37625, "Judul": "Cerium-Oxide-Modified Anodes for Efficient and UV-Stable ZnO-Based Perovskite Solar Cells", "Abstrak": "CeOxhas been widely used in optoelectronicdevices due to its special electronic and optical structure.Herein, CeOxwas directly doped into ZnO to successfullyconstruct a ZnO/CeOxelectron transport material (ETM)used in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The incorporation ofCeOxcan regulate the chemical compatibility between ZnOand perovskite, unmatched energy levels, and poor UVstability, further enhancing the cell performance and stabilityof PSCs. As expected, the best efficiency of fabricatedCH3NH3PbI3-PSCs based on ZnO/CeOxas the ETM wasup to 19.5%. In contrast, the efficiency of PSCs with pure ZnOwas 16.0%. Moreover, compared with PSCs based on ZnO, ZnO/CeOx-based PSCs exhibited significantly enhanced moisture,and thermal and UV stability. These results point to the introduction of rare-earth oxides, which could accelerate theindustrialization of PSCs.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Ruiqian_Meng_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/165083"}, "Penulis": "Ruiqian Meng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiaoxia Feng, Yiwei Yang, Xudong Lv, Jing Cao,and Yu Tang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "ZnO, CeOx, perovskite solar cells, electron transport material, UV stability", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
