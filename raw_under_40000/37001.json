{"Nomor": 37001, "Judul": "Tactical Urbanism: The New Vernacular of the Creative City", "Abstrak": "The recent infatuation of urban governance with the ideologies of creativity has led to many cities over\nthe world being branded as \u2018Creative Cities\u2019. This policy drive has been problematised of late as a\nneoliberal agenda, which critics argue aids in the gentrification of cities. One reaction to this has been\nthe proliferation of community-orientated initiatives on a smaller scale that are (sometimes) conducted\noutside the official capacity of the city. So-called Tactical Urbanism draws from such activity and\ntherefore has become a popular movement for people who have a desire to change and reconfigure their\ncity and do so without governmental involvement. Championed by the urbanist Mike Lydon, this\npaper charts how Tactical Urbanism has become a brand in itself, with the term being used by urban\ngovernments as a means of continuing neoliberal policies of urban development in a post-2008\nrecessionary era. This paper will show how Tactical Urbanism is defenestrating the former, in favour of\nthe latter. In so doing, it is fast becoming the latest political vernacular of the Creative City.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Oli Mould [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Architecture", "Kata Kunci": "Vernacular architecture ; tactical ; urbanism ; creative city", "Sumber": "Geography Compass 8/8 (2014): 529\u2013539, 10.1111/gec3.12146", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Mar 2019"}
