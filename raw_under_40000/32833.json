{"Nomor": 32833, "Judul": "FORWARD DIHADRON BACK-TO-BACK CORRELATIONS IN PA COLLISIONS", "Abstrak": "We study the disappearance of the away-side peak of the di-hadron correlation function in p \u00fe A\nvs p \u00fe p collisions at forward rapidities, when the scaterring process presents a manifest dilute-dense\nasymmetry. We improve the state-of-the-art description of this phenomenon in the framework of the color\nglass condensate (CGC), for hadrons produced nearly back to back. In that case, the gluon content of the saturated nuclear target can be described with transverse-momentum-dependent gluon distributions, whose small-x evolution we calculate numerically by solving the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation with running\ncoupling corrections. We first show that our formalism provides a good description of the disappearance of the away-side azimuthal correlations in d \u00fe Au collisions observed at BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) energies. Then, we predict the away-side peak of upcoming p \u00fe Au data at\nffiffiffisp \u00bc 200 GeV to be suppressed by about a factor 2 with respect to p \u00fe p collisions, and we propose to study the rapidity dependence of that suppression as a complementary strong evidence of gluon saturation in experimental data.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "JAVIER L.
