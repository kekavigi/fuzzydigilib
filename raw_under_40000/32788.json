{"Nomor": 32788, "Judul": "DEVELOPING AND ASSESSING TUTORIALS FOR QUANTUM MECHANICS: TIME DEPENDENCE AND MEASUREMENTS", "Abstrak": "Tutorials in Physics: Quantum Mechanics is a set of curricular materials for supplementing upperdivision\nquantum mechanics instruction, developed by the physics education group at the University of\nWashington. We describe the development of a sequence of three tutorials that focused on quantum\nmeasurements and time dependence. This sequence of tutorials is based on prominent findings in the\nresearch literature related to student understanding, as well as classroom techniques and strategies that have\nproved effective in other instructional contexts in physics. We also present data from a set of four exam\nquestions used to evaluate how effectively these tutorials improve student ability to use correct\nmathematical and conceptual reasoning to predict the time evolution of quantum probabilities. We find\nthat student performance on each question is significantly better than on corresponding questions given\nafter only traditional instruction, with effect sizes that range from small to moderate. This improvement,\nalong with a decrease in the prevalence of common incorrect lines of reasoning, supports our claim that this set of three tutorials from Tutorials in Physics: Quantum Mechanics assists advanced undergraduate\nstudents\u2019 in developing a conceptual understanding of some of the fundamental quantum concepts about\ntime evolution and measurements when given after traditional lecture instruction. However, our results also show that there are some topics with which many students still struggle and, thus, that there remains room for further research and development of materials for these topics.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "PAUL J.
