{"Nomor": 33572, "Judul": "Ideological traces in Ghana's urban plans: How do traces get worked out in the Agbogbloshie, Accra?", "Abstrak": "Neoliberalism, rights to the city, and sustainable development are systems of ideas competing for the attention of\npolicymakers and citizens worldwide. Analyzing Ghana's key urban reports, we produce a heat map of the\nintensity and fragility of ideas concerning the urban poor. We employ the Agbogbloshie informal settlement as a\ncase study to explore conflicts among diverse planning goals: urban entrepreneurialism, environmental protection, formalization of parts of the informal economy, the reframing of citizenship, and settlement upgrading.\nDecongestion exercises, shack demolitions, and threats of relocation are strategies employed to restore order, but\nthe settlement's regeneration is beset by transience and piecemeal actions. We introduce hypocrisy as a theoretical analytical perspective to call into question pro-poor urban planning interventions as a way of responding\nto continuous ambivalent planning measures and framing. Hypocrisy prompts an alternative focus on inconsistencies and contradictions in the planning system.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Martin Oteng-Ababioa [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Communities", "Kata Kunci": "Neoliberalism Rights to the city Sustainable development Informal settlement Agbogbloshie Accra", "Sumber": "Habitat International Volume 83, January 2019, Pages 1-10", "Staf Input/Edit": "Rd.
