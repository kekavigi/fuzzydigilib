Their roles in treating aspects concerning the nonlocal motion relative to Earth, the free-fall problem, the Foucault pendulum and the motion of a massive body in a rotating tube are analyzed. Governing nonlocal equations of fluid dynamics in particular the nonlocal-in-time Navier\u2013Stokes equations are constructed under the influence of Earth rotation. Their properties are analyzed and a number of features were revealed and discussed accordingly.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP RAMI  AHMAD EL-NABULSI 1": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/157605"}, "Penulis": "Rami Ahmad El-Nabulsi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Rotational dynamics,  Nonlocal motion relative to Earth,  Nonlocal fluid equations", "Sumber": "Earth, Moon, and Planets  November 2018, Volume 122, Issue 1\u20132, pp 15\u201341 | Cite as", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos \u00a0\n                                     Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Feb 2019"}
