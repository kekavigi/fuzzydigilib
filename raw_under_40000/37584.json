{"Nomor": 37584, "Judul": "HEAT FLOWCONTROL BY TRANSFORMATION METHODWITHGRIDGENERATIONMETHOD", "Abstrak": "In the context of the transformation method, we propose a general approach to\nconstruct numerically the mapping generated by imposing specific boundary conditions with a\ntargeted function, and the necessary material and heat source spatial distributions are then derived\nwith the help of transformation method. The construction of mapping by grid generation method\nthrough solving partial differential equations circumvents the limitation of device geometry, which\npaves the way for designing more complex heat flow control devices. Two numerical examples\nare also given to show how to design material properties and heat source in order to control\ntemperature patterns.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zheng Chang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiaoning Liu, Gengkai Hu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "heat conduction, inverse problem, transformation method, grid generation", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Apr 2019"}
