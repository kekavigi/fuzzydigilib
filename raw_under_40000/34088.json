{"Nomor": 34088, "Judul": "Legionella occurrence in municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants and risks of reclaimed wastewater reuse: Review", "Abstrak": "Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been identified as confirmed but until today underestimated sources of Legionella, playing an important role in local and community cases and outbreaks of\nLegionnaires\u2019 disease. In general, aerobic biological systems provide an optimum environment for the\ngrowth of Legionella due to high organic nitrogen and oxygen concentrations, ideal temperatures and the\npresence of protozoa. However, few studies have investigated the occurrence of Legionella in WWTPs,\nand many questions in regards to the interacting factors that promote the proliferation and persistence of\nLegionella in these treatment systems are still unanswered. This critical review summarizes the current\nknowledge about Legionella in municipal and industrial WWTPs, the conditions that might support their\ngrowth, as well as control strategies that have been applied. Furthermore, an overview of current\nquantification methods, guidelines and health risks associated with Legionella in reclaimed wastewater is\nalso discussed in depth. A better understanding of the conditions promoting the occurrence of Legionella\nin WWTPs will contribute to the development of improved wastewater treatment technologies and/or\ninnovative mitigation approaches to minimize future Legionella outbreaks.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "C.
