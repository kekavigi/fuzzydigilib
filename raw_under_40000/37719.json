{"Nomor": 37719, "Judul": "Optimal synchronization deep in the quantum regime: Resource and fundamental limit", "Abstrak": "We develop an analytical framework to study the synchronization of a quantum self-sustained oscillator to\nan external signal. Our unified description allows us to identify the resource on which quantum synchronizationrelies, and to compare quantitatively the synchronization behavior of different limit cycles and signals.We focus on the most elementary quantum system that is able to host a self-sustained oscillation, namely, a single spin 1.Despite the spin having no classical analog, we first show that it can realize the van der Pol limit cycle deep in the quantum regime, which allows us to provide an analytical understanding to recently reported numerical results. Moving on to the equatorial limit cycle, we then reveal the existence of an interference-based quantum synchronization blockade and extend the classical Arnold tongue to a snakelike split tongue. Finally, we derive the maximum synchronization that can be achieved in the spin-1 system, and construct a limit cycle that reaches this fundamental limit asymptotically.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Martin Koppenh\u00f6fer and Alexandre Roulet [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Generalities", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW A 99, 043804 (2019); \u00a92019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari \u00a0\n                                     Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Apr 2019"}
