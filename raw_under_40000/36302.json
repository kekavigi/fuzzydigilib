{"Nomor": 36302, "Judul": "First-Principles Molecular Dynamics Simulations of UCln?NaCl (n=3,4) Molten Salts", "Abstrak": "Molten chloride salts are one of the two main choices todissolve nuclear fuels for fast-spectrum molten-salt reactors, as ageneration IV reactor design. Both U3+and U4+can stably exist inmolten chlorides, but the differences in their structure and chemicalproperties in molten NaCl are not well understood. In this work we usefirst-principles molecular dynamics simulations based on density func-tional theory to investigate the structure of UCln(n= 3, 4) in moltenNaCl at various mole fractions. Wefind that 7-fold- and 8-fold-coordinatestructures of Cl around U become more populous in UCl3?NaCl whenUCl3concentration is higher than 25 mol %, while in UCl4?NaCl the 6-fold-coordinate structure is the leading species when the UCl4concentration is higher than 32 mol %. Moreover, wefind that thefirstsolvation shell of Cl around U is more dynamic in UCl3?NaCl than UCl4?NaCl, evidenced by weaker U?Cl bonds and fasterU?Cl dissociation in the former. Further analysis reveals that a network structure with sharing Cl?between U cations startsforming at the low U3+concentrations, whereas the U4+?Cl??U4+linkages become noticeable only after UCl4concentration islarger than 32 mol %. This work sheds new light on the difference between U3+and U4+in molten NaCl.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Bo_Li_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/161990"}, "Penulis": "Bo Li [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sheng Dai,De-en Jiang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "first-principles molecular dynamics, molten salt, UCl3?NaCl, UCl4?NaCl, network structure", "Sumber": "ACSAppl.EnergyMater.XXXX, XXX, XXX?XXX", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Mar 2019"}
