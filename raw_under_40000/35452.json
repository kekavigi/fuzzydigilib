{"Nomor": 35452, "Judul": "Aesthetic encounters and learning in the museum", "Abstrak": "This article discusses how museum settings can provide opportunities for sensory  and  aesthetic  encounters  and  learning.  It  draws  on  research  into  museum education programmes that included examinations of curatorial construction   and   display,   observations   of   teaching  and   open ended   \ninterviews  with  museum  educators.  The  examples  selected  here  focus  on themes of display and learning to illustrate how aesthetic experiences can  emerge  as  incidental  adjuncts  to  learning  in  other  fields.  They  also  acknowledge how museums draw on aesthetic judgements to categorise \nor   present   objects   and   employ   aesthetic   artefacts   and   practices   as   representative devices of cultural engagement, especially in learning themes in the humanities. The studies show how museums can offer opportunities and  skills,  and  cultivate  dispositions  to  the  examination  of  challenging  ideas  about  aesthetic  status,  sensibility,  interpretation  or  value.  Examples  \nof purposefully constructed sites for aesthetic learning show how museum educators have rethought ways of facilitating affective sensory experiences, and raising questions of aesthetic status, response and the social and cultural functions of the arts. The studies discussed here suggest that museums can provide dedicated opportunities to cultivate independent aesthetic thinking and debate about aesthetic ideas as lifelong skills and pleasures.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "David Raymond Bell [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "contingency; learning  aesthetics; museum  education; sensory  engagement", "Sumber": "Educational PhilosoPhy and  thEory, 2017 Vol . 49,  no . 8, 776\u2013787", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Feb 2019"}
