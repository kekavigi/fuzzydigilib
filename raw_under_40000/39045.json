{"Nomor": 39045, "Judul": "Polymer-Encapsulated Lanthanide-Containing Clusters as Platforms for Fabricating Magnetic Soft Materials", "Abstrak": "Although many high-nuclearity lanthanide-containing clusters with aesthetical topological nanoarchitectures and\nunique magnetic properties have been synthesized, there was a big\ntime lag to develop functional soft materials and devices on the basis\nof these clusters, because of their stability and processability. Herein,\nwe report a universal strategy to fabricate lanthanide cluster based\nmagnetic soft materials under ambient conditions. The prototypical\ncluster [Gd52Ni56(IDA)48(OH)154(H2O)38]18+ was encapsulated as\nan inorganic core by polymeric shells of sulfonate end functionalized\npoly(ethylene glycol) monoalkyl ethers through electrostatic\ninteraction. The thickness of the shell was readily controlled by\nprecisely tuning length of the polymer chain, leading to controllably reduced antiferromagnetic interactions between the clusters.\nThe encapsulated hybrids can self-assemble to form vesicles in solution and can be used as an excellent agent for in vivo magnetic\nresonance imaging.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Qun He 1.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170901"}, "Penulis": "Qun He [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Huanting Huang, Xiu-Ying Zheng, Jie Xiao, Bingran Yu, Xiang-Jian Kong, Weifeng Bu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "anthanide-containing clusters, self-assembly, magnetic properties, vesicles, encapsulatio", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
