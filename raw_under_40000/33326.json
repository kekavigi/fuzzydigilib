{"Nomor": 33326, "Judul": "Effects of polystyrene microplastics on the composition of the microbiome and metabolism in larval zebrafish", "Abstrak": "Microplastics are major pollutants in marine environment and may have health effects on aquatic organisms. In this study, we used two sizes (5 and 50 mm diameter) of fluorescent and virgin polystyrene\nmicroplastics to analyze the adverse effects on larval zebrafish. In our study, we evaluated the effects on\nlarval zebrafish after exposure to 100 and 1000 mg/L of two sizes of polystyrene microplastics for 7 days.\nOur results show that polystyrene microplastics could cause alterations in the microbiome at the phylum\nand genus levels in larval zebrafish, including changes in abundance and diversity of the microbiome. In\naddition, metabolomic analysis suggested that exposure to polystyrene microplastics induced alterations\nof metabolic profiles in larval zebrafish, and differential metabolites were involved in energy metabolism,\nglycolipid metabolism, inflammatory response, neurotoxic response, nucleic acid metabolism, oxidative\nstress. Polystyrene microplastics also significantly decreased the activities of catalase and the content of\nglutathione. In addition, the results of gene transcription analysis showed that exposure to polystyrene\nmicroplastics induced changes in glycolysis-related genes and lipid metabolism-related genes, confirming that polystyrene microplastics disturbed glycolipid and energy metabolism. Taken together, the\nresults obtained in the present study indicated that the potential effects of environmental microplastics\non aquatic organisms should not be ignored.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zhiqin Wan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Caiyun Wang.,Jiajie Zhou.,Manlu Shen.,Xiaoyu Wang., Zhengwei Fu.,Yuanxiang Jin"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Polystyrene microplastic Microbiome Metabolism disorder Larval zebrafish", "Sumber": "Chemosphere 217 (2019) 646-658", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Jan 2019"}
