{"Nomor": 38513, "Judul": "Intuitive Law in the Light of Independent Ethics", "Abstrak": "The conception of the paper is connected with bringing  forward the reflection of Leon Petra\n?ycki on intuitive law. For this purpose I analyze the genesis and dynamics  of  this  phenomenon  on  the  cultural-historical  level,  as  well  as  with reference  to  issues  belonging  to  the  scope  of  positive  law.  In  addition,  I broaden the research field with the range of problems touching on intuitionism, morality, and also independent ethics of Janusz Kotarbinski. The starting point of  the  methodological  optics  I  assume  is  constituted  by  the  multi-aspectual transformations  surrounding  us  in  the  sphere  of  axiology.  Hence,  if  the pedagogical   aspects  are  taken  into  account,  it  seems  to  me  justified  to undertake some actions in order to search for the logically consistent, sensible and  universal  solutions,  which  can  become  an  ethical  guide-post  for  the contemporary human being.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ma?gorzata Obrycka [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "independent  ethics,  intuitionism,  morality,  intui tive  law,  ethical  education.", "Sumber": "Studia Humana Volume 7:3 (2018), pp. 21\u201430", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Mei 2019"}
