Although these methods were not based on scientific evidence at the time, they are nonetheless consistent with a contemporary understanding of human vision. The authors propose that artists in the late early-modern period developed the technique of textural agency\u2014selective variation in image detail\u2014to guide the observer\u2019s eye and thereby influence the viewing experience. \nThey conclude with the presenta-tion of laboratory evidence that Rembrandt\u2019s techniques indeed \nguide the modern viewer\u2019s eye as proposed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Steve DiPaola [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Caitlin Riebe  and James T.
