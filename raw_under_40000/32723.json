{"Nomor": 32723, "Judul": "NONLINEAR ANALYSIS OFA 5-LAYER BEAM-LIKE PIEZOELECTRIC TRANSFORMER NEAR RESONANCE", "Abstrak": "The paper examines the weakly nonlinear behavior of a 5-layer beam-like piezoelectric\ntransformer operating near resonance, where the main structure of the device consists of\nproperly poled and electroded flexible piezoceramic four-layers separated by a central metallic\nlayer. Nonlinear effects of the large deflection to induce the incidental in-plane extension near resonance\nare considered, which is shown that on one side of the resonant frequency the output-input\nrelation becomes nonlinear, and the other side output voltage experiences jumps.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hairen Wang, Xuan Xie, Yuantai Hu, Ji Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "piezoelectric transformer, resonance, nonlinear vibration, jump, multi-valuedness", "Sumber": "Science Direct", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Jan 2019"}
