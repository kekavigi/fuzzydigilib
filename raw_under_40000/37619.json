{"Nomor": 37619, "Judul": "The unexpected surface of asteroid (101955) Bennu", "Abstrak": "NASA\u2019S Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft recently arrived at the near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennu, a primitive body that represents the objects that may have brought prebiotic\nmolecules and volatiles such as water to Earth1. Bennu is a lowalbedo B-type asteroid2 that has been linked to organic-rich hydrated carbonaceous chondrites3\n. Such meteorites are altered by ejection from their parent body and contaminated by atmospheric entry and terrestrial microbes. Therefore, the primary mission objective\nis to return a sample of Bennu to Earth that is pristine\u2014that is, not affected by these processes4. The OSIRIS-REx spacecraft carries a sophisticated suite of instruments to characterize Bennu\u2019s global properties, support the selection of a sampling site and document that site at a sub-centimetre scale5\u201311. Here we consider early\nOSIRIS-REx observations of Bennu to understand how the asteroid\u2019s properties compare to pre-encounter expectations and to assess the prospects for sample return. The bulk composition of Bennu appears to be hydrated and volatile-rich, as expected. However, in contrast to pre-encounter modelling of Bennu\u2019s thermal inertia12 and radar\npolarization ratios13\u2014which indicated a generally smooth surface covered by centimetre-scale particles\u2014resolved imaging reveals an unexpected surficial diversity. The albedo, texture, particle size and roughness are beyond the spacecraft design specifications. On the basis of our pre-encounter knowledge, we developed a sampling\nstrategy to target 50-metre-diameter patches of loose regolith with grain sizes smaller than two centimetres4. We observe only a small number of apparently hazard-free regions, of the order of 5 to 20 metres in extent, the sampling of which poses a substantial challenge to mission success.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_DS_LAURETTA_3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/165076"}, "Penulis": "D.S LAURETTA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["D.N.
