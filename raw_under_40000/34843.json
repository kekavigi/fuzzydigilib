{"Nomor": 34843, "Judul": "Is anammox a promising treatment process for nitrogen removal from nitrogen-rich saline wastewater?", "Abstrak": "Rapidly growing discharge of nitrogen-rich saline wastewater has significantly affect environment. However,\ndue to the inhibition resulting from high salinity on microbes, it is still a challenge to treat nitrogen-rich saline\nwastewater efficiently. Anammox process, as a cost-effective and environment-friendly nitrogen removal approach, has shown a potential in treating nitrogen-rich saline wastewater. This review is conducted from a\ncritical perspective and provides a comprehensive overview on the performance of anammox process treating\nnitrogen-rich saline wastewater. Two strategies including freshwater-derived anammox bacteria acclimatization\nand marine anammox bacteria enrichment are evaluated. Second, effects resulting from salinity on the performance of anammox reactor, the microbial communities and sludge characteristics are discussed. Third, salinitytolerant mechanism of anammox bacteria is analyzed. This review also reveals some critical knowledge gaps and\nfuture research needs, which benefits application of anammox process to treat nitrogen-rich saline wastewater.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jin Li [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Panqing Qi.,Zhimin Qiangb., Huiyu Dong., Dawen Gao.,Dan Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Nitrogen-rich saline wastewater Anammox process Salinity tolerance Nitrogen removal Sludge characteristics", "Sumber": "Bioresource Technology 270 (2018) 722\u2013731", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Feb 2019"}
