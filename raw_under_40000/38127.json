{"Nomor": 38127, "Judul": "Study Of The Influences Of Rotary Table Speed On Stick-Slip Vibration Of The Drilling System", "Abstrak": "Stick-slip vibration presents one of the major causes of drilling problems, such as premature tool\nfailures, low drilling efficiency and poor wellbore quality. The objective of this work is to investigate\nthe influences of rotary table speed (RTS) on stick-slip phenomenon of the drilling system. In this\nstudy, the drilling system is treated as a lumped torsional pendulum model of which the bit/rock\ninteraction is regarded as Coulomb friction. By analyzing cases with different RTS, two types of\nvibrations on the bit are found: stick-slip vibration and uniform motion. With an increase in the\nRTS, the stick-slip vibration on the drill bit disappears once the RTS arrives at its critical value. For\nthe cases that stick-slip vibrations occur, the phase trajectories converge toward a limit cycle. For\nthe cases that stick-slip vibration does not appear, the drill bit tends to stabilize at a uniform motion\nand the phase trajectories correspond to contracting spirals observed in the phase plane.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "LIPING TANG  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiaohua Zhu", "Changshuai Shi", "Jian Tang", "Daping Xu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Stick-slip vibration, Rotary table speed, Drillstring, Drill bit, Frictional torque, Limit cycle", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 4, Pages 382-387 (December  2015), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.10.004", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Mei 2019"}
