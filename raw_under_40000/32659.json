{"Nomor": 32659, "Judul": "Petroleum Oil Dispersion Efficiency and Stability Using Eco-Friendly Chitosan-Based Surfactant and Nanoparticles", "Abstrak": "In this article, a new aspect of comparing oil dispersion efficiency and stability using eco-friendly\nsurfactants and nanoparticles of the same natural origin was carried out. Nanoparticles effectively disperse oil in water as well as do surfactant but with different actions; surfactants act by reducing the\ninterfacial tension between oil and water leading to the distribution of oil in water while nanoparticles\ngive stable and uniform distribution of oil in water depending on oil trapping inside the polymer matrix.\nAs a result, the dispersion stability of nanoparticles was found to be superior to that of surfactant.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "A.
