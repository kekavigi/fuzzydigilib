{"Nomor": 35620, "Judul": "A Novel Model For Predicting The Temperature Profile In Gas Lift Wells", "Abstrak": "One of the most common methods for calculating the production oil rate in a gas lift well is nodal\nanalysis. This manner is an accurate one, but unfortunately it is very time consuming and slow. In\nsome modern studies in petroleum engineering such as close loop control of the wells this slowness makes it impossible to have an online optimization. In fact, before the end of the optimization\nthe input parameters have changed. Thus having a faster model is necessary specially in some of\nthe new studies. One of the sources of slowness of the nodal analysis is the temperature profile\nestimation of the wells. There are two general approaches for temperature profile estimation, some\nlike heat balance are accurate but slow. Others, similar to linear profile assumption are fast but\ninaccurate and usually are not used commonly. Here, as a new approach, a combination model of\nheat balance and linear temperature profile estimation has represented which makes the nodal\nanalysis three times faster and it is as accurate as heat balance calculations. To create this, two\npoints (gas injection point and end of tubing) are selected, then using heat balance equations the\ntemperature of those two points are calculated. In normal nodal analysis the temperature of each\nwanted point in the well is estimated by heat balance and it is the source of slowness but here just\ntwo points are calculated using those complex equations. It seems that between these points\nassuming a linear temperature profile is reasonable because the parameters of the well and production such as physical tubing, and casing shape and properties and gas oil ratio are constants. But\nof course, it still has some deviation from the complete method of heat balance which using\nregression and assigning a coefficient to the model even this much of the deviation could be\novercame. Finally, the model was tested in various wells and it was compared with the normal\nnodal analysis with complete heat balance models. Results showed that the new model is as accurate as normal heat balance but three times faster.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MOHAMMAD REZA MAHDIANI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ehsan Khamehchi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Temperature profile, Gas lift, Heat balance, Modeling", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 4, Pages 399-414 (December 2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Feb 2019"}
