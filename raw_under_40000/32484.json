{"Nomor": 32484, "Judul": "System evolution prediction and manipulation using a Lotka\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdVolterra ecosystem model", "Abstrak": "System evolution prediction is critical for designers to make R&D and\noutsourcing decisions. Many descriptive models are used for this purpose, but\nthey have several limitations. In this paper, we extend the Lotka\n\nVolterra\nequations as an ecosystem model to predict the performances of the system and\nits components. This model comprises a set of differential equations that\ndescribe symbiosis, commensalism, and amensalism relationships between a\nsystem and multiple components. We associate every parameter in the model\nwith its causal factors, develop a three-step application of the model, and\nillustrate the application through a case study on passenger airplane fuel\nefficiency. Our model identifies the key components in a system. The identified\ncomponents help designers generate strategies to boost system performance.\n\n2018 Elsevier Ltd.
