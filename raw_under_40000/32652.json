Common treatment\nconsists of cognitive behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy. In clinical practice,\nalso art therapy is additionally provided to patients with anxiety (disorders), among others\nbecause treatment as usual is not sufficiently effective for a large group of patients. There is\nno clarity on the effectiveness of art therapy (AT) on the reduction of anxiety symptoms in\nadults and there is no overview of the intervention characteristics and working mechanisms.\nMethods\nA systematic review of (non-)randomised controlled trials on AT for anxiety in adults to evaluate\nthe effects on anxiety symptom severity and to explore intervention characteristics,\nbenefitting populations and working mechanisms. Thirteen databases and two journals\nwere searched for the period 1997 \u2013October 2017. The study was registered at PROSPERO\n(CRD42017080733) and performed according to the Cochrane recommendations.\nPRISMA Guidelines were used for reporting.\nResults\nOnly three publications out of 776 hits from the search fulfilled the inclusion criteria: three\nRCTs with 162 patients in total. All studies have a high risk of bias. Study populations were:\nstudents with PTSD symptoms, students with exam anxiety and prisoners with prelease\nanxiety. Visual art techniques varied: trauma-related mandala design, collage making, free\npainting, clay work, still life drawing and house-tree-person drawing. There is some evidence\nof effectiveness of AT for pre-exam anxiety in undergraduate students. AT is possibly\neffective in reducing pre-release anxiety in prisoners. The AT characteristics varied and narrative\nsynthesis led to hypothesized working mechanisms of AT: induce relaxation; gain\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0208716 December 17, 2018 1 / 19\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Abbing A, Ponstein A, van Hooren S, de\nSonneville L, Swaab H, Baars E (2018) The\neffectiveness of art therapy for anxiety in adults: A\nsystematic review of randomised and nonrandomised\ncontrolled trials.
