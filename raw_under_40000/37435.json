{"Nomor": 37435, "Judul": "Inflammation clues in STING protein structure", "Abstrak": "The branch of the immune system called innate immunity has a pivotal role in host defence by recognizing general hallmarks of disease-causing agents. The intracellular protein STING, a transmembrane protein usually located on an organelle called the endoplasmic reticulum, is a key regulator of this type of immune response1. Writing in Nature, Shang et al.2 and Zhang et al.3 report full-length structures of STING, including\nSTING in complex with the kinase protein TBK1, which initiates the downstream signalling pathway that is triggered on STING activation.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ANDREA ABLASSER [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Inflammation, STING protein structure", "Sumber": "Springer Nature", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Mar 2019"}
