{"Nomor": 34176, "Judul": "Bio-conversion of photosynthetic bacteria from non-toxic wastewater to realize wastewater treatment and bioresource recovery: A review", "Abstrak": "Generating or recycling water and resources from wastewater other than just treating wastewater is one of the\nmost popular trends worldwide. Photosynthetic bacteria (PSB) wastewater treatment and resource recovery\ntechnology is one of the most potential methods. PSBs are non-toxic and contain lots of value-added products\nthat can be utilized in the agricultural and food industries. They are effective to degrade pollutants and synthesize useful biomass, thus realizing wastewater treatment, bioresource production, and eliminating waste\nsludge. If all the nutrients in wastewaters could be bio-converted by PSB, then pollutant reductions and economic benefits would be achieved. This review paper firstly describes and summarizes this technology, including\nPSBs classification, metabolism, and the market application. The feasibility, technical procedures, bioreactors,\npollutant removal, and bioresource production are also summarized, compared and evaluated. Issues that\nconcern the advantages and industrialization of this technologies at the plant scale are also discussed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Haifeng Lu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Guangming Zhang.,Ziqiao Zheng.,Fan Meng.,Taisheng Du.,, Shichao He"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Photosynthetic bacteria Non-toxic wastewater Bio-conversion Wastewater treatment Bioresource recovery", "Sumber": "Bioresource Technology xxx (xxxx) xxx\u2013xxx", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Feb 2019"}
