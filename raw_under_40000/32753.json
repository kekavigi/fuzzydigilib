{"Nomor": 32753, "Judul": "Decisions and actions of distracted drivers at the onset of yellow lights", "Abstrak": "Driving on an approach to a signalized intersection while distracted is relatively risky, as potential\nvehicular conflicts and resulting angle collisions tend to be relatively more severe compared to other\nlocations. Given the prevalence and importance of this particular scenario, the objective of this studywas\nto examine the decisions and actions of distracted drivers during the onset of yellow lights. Driving\nsimulator data were obtained from a sample of 69 drivers under baseline and handheld cell phone\nconditions at the University of Iowa \u2013 National Advanced Driving Simulator. Explanatory variables\nincluded age, gender, cell phone use, distance to stop-line, and speed. Although there is extensive\nresearch on drivers\u2019 responses to yellow traffic signals, the examinations have been conducted from a\ntraditional regression-based approach, which do not necessary provide the underlying relations and\npatterns among the sampled data. In this paper, we exploit the benefits of both classical statistical\ninference and data mining techniques to identify the a priori relationships among main effects, nonlinearities,\nand interaction effects. Results suggest that the probability of yellow light running increases\nwith the increase in driving speed at the onset of yellow. Both young (18\u201325 years) and middle-aged\n(30\u201345 years) drivers reveal reduced propensity for yellow light running whilst distracted across the\nentire speed range, exhibiting possible risk compensation during this critical driving situation. The\npropensity for yellow light running for both distracted male and female older (50\u201360 years) drivers is\nsignificantly higher. Driver experience captured by age interacts with distraction, resulting in their\ncombined effect having slower physiological response and being distracted particularly risky.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Md.
