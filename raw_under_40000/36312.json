{"Nomor": 36312, "Judul": "Alcohol and nicotine consumption trends in three U.S. communities determined by wastewater-based epidemiology", "Abstrak": "Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), an emerging tool for monitoring public health in near real-time, is used\nextensively in Europe but applications to U.S. populations are still scarce. In this longitudinal study, raw wastewater was collected monthly from three U.S. cities as 24-h weekday composites and analyzed for evidence of alcohol\nand tobacco consumption. Over the 11-month sampling period, biomarkers of stimulant use were detected in\nwastewater by isotope dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in units of ?g/L (ethyl sulfate,\n1.6\u201325.1; nicotine, 0.6\u201326.7; cotinine, 0.2\u20133.8; and 3?hydroxycotinine, 0.3\u20133.8). Average consumption rates in\nthe three communities were calculated using detected biomarker levels in conjunction with wastewater flow\nrates, metabolic excretion factors, and population size data. Computed average per-capita consumption rates estimated for the sub-population aged 15 and above for alcohol (13.4 \u00b1 5.6 L/y/person) and daily consumption of\nnicotine by smokers (14.2 \u00b1 3.6 cigarettes/d/person) were in good agreement with U.S. survey data (9.0 L/y/person; 14.2 cigarettes/d/smoker). The WBE approach also captured impacts of temporal population influx on substance consumption patterns. This first U.S. WBE study to track recreational use of stimulants longitudinally and\nconcurrently in multiple American cities highlights opportunities for collecting robust public health information\nfrom wastewater anonymously, economically and in near real-time.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jing Chen [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Arjun K.
