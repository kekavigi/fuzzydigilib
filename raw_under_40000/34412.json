{"Nomor": 34412, "Judul": "Adsorption of textile wastewater on alkaliactivated sand", "Abstrak": "This paper deals with the removal of residual dyes from actual textile wastewater after receiving\ncoagulation-flocculation treatment by employing alkali-activated local sand as a novel low-cost\nadsorbent. The activation process was found to increase the surface area and negative charge on\nthe sand surface thereby offering good adsorption capacity. Batch adsorption studies were\ncarried out with respect to contact time (3-30 minutes) and amount of adsorbent (12.5-100 g) to\nevaluate its dye removal capacity from wastewater. The surface of natural, modified and dye\nadsorbed sand was characterized using X-ray Diffraction analysis (XRD), Scanning Electron\nMicroscopy (SEM), Zeta Potential Analysis and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy\n(FTIR) to understand the mechanism of sorption. To examine the adsorption behavior\nLagergren\u2019s pseudo-first order, second order, and intraparticle diffusion models were applied for\nkinetic studies. These studies indicated that pseudo-second order model fitted the best; yielding a\nhigh correlation coefficient (R\n2\n) of more than 0.995. The color removal using modified sand was\nfound to be 70% in first 3 minutes while non-modified sand could only remove 40% of dye\nmolecules, even after 20 minutes of adsorption. The results suggest that the activated sand can be\nused as a cost-effective adsorbent for color removal from wastewater of textile industries.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Aditya Sharma [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zainab Syed., Urmila Brighu., Akhilendra Bhushan Gupta.,, Chhatra Ram"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Textile wastewater, sand, adsorption, dyes.", "Sumber": "Journal of Cleaner Production", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Feb 2019"}
