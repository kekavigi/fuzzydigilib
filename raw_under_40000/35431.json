INTRODUCTION In the last two decades, the increasing load of communicable diseases with heavy use of antibiotics has resulted in the progression and persistence of drug-resistant infections.1 The continuous emergence of drug-resistant bacteria against the most potent antibiotics is presenting a serious threat to public health. Also, it is resulting in increased chances of serious illness, leading to death in most of the cases, with an extra expenditure of >20 billion USD annually for developing an efficient health care system.1,2 A large number of infectious bacterial strains have developed antibiotics opposition, for example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VREs), along with those infecting to the immunocompromised conditions for, e.g., HIV/AIDS.3,4 Among others, more than 90%", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Feb 2019"}
