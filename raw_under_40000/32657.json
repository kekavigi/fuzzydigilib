{"Nomor": 32657, "Judul": "Design-based research as an informal learning model for choral conductors", "Abstrak": "The number of community choirs continues to grow, and literature endorsing the benefits of\nchoral singing for physical, mental and emotional health and well-being is rapidly expanding,\nmeaning that the professional development of community choral conductors is in the public\ninterest. However, research on choral conductor education remains limited. Theoretical\nperspectives on choral conductor training presented by Varvarigou and Durrant (2011) have\nprovided a useful framework for conceptualizing a formal training model. As opportunities to\nstudy using such a model are not widely available in Australia and other locations, it is pertinent\nto consider alternative methods for community choral conductors to learn the craft and\ndevelop their skills. A design-based research model has been proposed as a possible format\nfor learning choral conducting and the case study of the author\u2019s own practice reported here\nreveals its effectiveness. The design-based research structure, incorporating observation and\ninterview with ten professional choral conductors, as well as cycles of design, intervention and\nevaluation is proposed as a possible informal learning approach for other choral conductors.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Naomi Cooper [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "choral conducting; community choir; design-based research", "Sumber": "Western Sydney University", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Des 2018"}
