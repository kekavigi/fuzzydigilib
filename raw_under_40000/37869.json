In  experiment  1  we  worked  with  three  kinds  of   jokes,  specifically  mentalistic jokes,  jokes  based  on  substitution and complex\njokes.  We  found  differentiated  performances  on  each  kind  of   joke,  as  had  been  expected  based  on  the  semiological  analysis  of   the jokes prior to the experiment. The earliest comprehension, at 3 years old, occurred with mentalistic jokes where more than 70% of  the total\nsample was successful. The substitution jokes reached 47% in the three-year-old subjects, and thelatest kind of  joke to be understood by this group were the complex jokes, with only 31% comprehension. In experiment 2 we wanted to specify the cognitive functioning that was taking\nplace in the comprehension of  mentalistic jokes. We found similar successful performances in two mentalistic jokes with both the 3 and 4 year-olds in the study. Children\u2019s performances were analyzed from the point of  view of  processes of  redescription which were involved in the understanding of  the jokes. We conclude that humor tasks are appropriate instruments to examine development of  children\u2019s representational abilities.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "REBECA PUCHE-NAVARRO [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Graphic joke, semiological analysis, incongruity, representational activity", "Sumber": "Scandinavian Journal of Psychology, 2004, 45, 343\u2013 355", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Apr 2019"}
