{"Nomor": 32743, "Judul": "Compensation mechanism for urban water environment treatment PPP project in China", "Abstrak": "The urban environment is the basis for the survival of urban residents. Thus, the government must\nimprove its governance given the unoptimistic urban water ecological environment. The progress on the\nurban water environment treatment project (UWETP) is slow because of government financial pressure,\nefficiency of governance, and other problems. New approaches are provided for urban water environment treatment with the development and application of a publiceprivateepartnership (PPP) model.\nHowever, designing a government compensation mechanism under the water environment treatment\nPPP projects relates to the effect of the water environment treatment. In accordance with the characteristics of the urban water environment treatment PPP projects, two standards are established in this\npaper. \u201cBasic standard\u201d indicates the minimum social and ecological benefits that the water environment\ntreatment project should meet, and \u201cdemonstrative standard\u201d denotes the ideal effect that the UWETP is\nexpected to satisfy. A governmental compensation method for urban water environment treatment PPP\nprojects is also formed from this incentive perspective. Furthermore, the economic benefits of the urban\nwater environment treatment are considered, and game theory is adopted to solve the incentive coefficient. Therefore, a comparatively effective governmental compensation mechanism is established to\nprovide a reference to implementing urban water environment treatment PPP projects.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xiaowei An [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Lunyan Wang.,, Zhuofu Wang .,Jiyong Ding.,Yongchao Cao"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Urban water environment Treatment PPP Government compensation Incentive", "Sumber": "Journal of Cleaner Production 201 (2018) 246-253", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "03 Jan 2019"}
