{"Nomor": 34397, "Judul": "Using Raman Shift And Ft-Ir Spectra As Quality Indices Of Oil Bit Pdc Cutters", "Abstrak": "Nowadays many of oil and gas wells are drilled extensively by Polycrystalline Diamond Compact (PDC) drill bits.\nVarious companies are manufacturing PDC cutters according to their usage. All of these companies concentrate\ntheir products of PDC cutters to be well resisting for abrasive wear. The wear of PDC inserts leads to money loss\nas well as delays the drilling procedures causing unexpected dilemmas. Therefore, it is crucially significant to\nevaluate the quality of the PDC cutters based on their resistance against abrasive wear.\nThe present work concentrates on assessing the PDC cutters from various sources using two non-destructive\nanalytical approaches: Raman-Shift and Fourier Transformation Infrared Ray (FT-IR) spectra. The analysis of the\nPDC samples with the analytical techniques were validated with the previous experimental results obtained from\nmicro and nano-scratch tests achieved on the same specimens.\nThe presented work could be performed on many PDC cutters from various manufacturers as the applied tests\nconsidered non-destructive compared to the traditional destructive techniques which leads the way for evaluating lots of PDC cutters without causing any damage. The analysis of the applied analytical approaches agreed\nwith the results obtained from previous experimental scratch tests.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "RAFID K.
