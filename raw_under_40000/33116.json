{"Nomor": 33116, "Judul": "TEMPERATURE RISE ASSOCIATED WITH ADIABATIC SHEAR BAND: CAUSALITY CLARIFIED", "Abstrak": "One of the most important issues related to adiabatic shear failure is the correlation among temperature\nelevation, adiabatic shear band (ASB) formation and the loss of load capacity of the material. Our\nexperimental results show direct evidence that ASB forms several microseconds after stress collapse and\ntemperature rise reaches its maximum about 30 ?s after ASB formation. This observation indicates that\ntemperature rise cannot be the cause of ASB. Rather, it might be the result of adiabatic shear localization.\nAs such, the traditional well-accepted thermal-softening mechanism of ASB needs to be reconsidered.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "YAZHOU GUO [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["QICHAO RUAN,", "SHENGXIN ZHU,", "Q.
