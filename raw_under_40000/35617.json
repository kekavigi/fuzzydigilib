This paper firstly investigated into the equilibrium issue among water influx, water injection and production. Equilibrium\nprinciple was elaborated through deduction of equilibrium equation and presentation of equilibrium curves with an \u201cequilibrium point\u201d. Influences of artificial controllable factors (e.g. well ratio\nof injection to production and total well number) on equilibrium were particularly analyzed using\nfield data. It was found that the influences were mainly reflected as the location move of equilibrium point with factor change. Then reservoir pressure maintenance level was especially\nintroduced to reveal the variation law of liquid rate and oil rate with the rising of water cut. It was\nalso found that, even if reservoir pressure kept constant, oil rate still inevitably declined. However,\nin the field, a stabilized oil rate was always pursued for development efficiency. Therefore, the\nequilibrium issue of stabilized oil production was studied deeply through probing into some\neffective measures to realize oil rate stability after the increase of water cut for the example\nreservoir. Successful example application indicated that the integrated approach was very practical\nand feasible, and hence could be used to the other similar reservoir", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Renshi Nie  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ting Ren", "Yonglu Jia"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Development equilibrium, Oil reservoir, Water injection, Water influx, Water cut, Stabilized production", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 4, Pages 381-392 (December 2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Feb 2019"}
