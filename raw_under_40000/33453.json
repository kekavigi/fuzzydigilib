{"Nomor": 33453, "Judul": "QED CALCULATIONS OF THE N = 2 TO N = 1 X-RAY TRANSITION ENERGIES IN MIDDLE-Z HELIUMLIKE IONS", "Abstrak": "Ab initio QED calculations of the four x-ray transitions from the L to K shell in heliumlike argon, titanium,\niron, copper, and krypton are performed. The binding energies for all the n = 1 and n = 2 states are evaluated as well. The calculation approach combines the rigorous QED treatment in the first two orders of the perturbation theory constructed within the extended Furry picture with the third- and higher-order correlation effects evaluated in the Breit approximation. The obtained results are compared with the previous evaluations and available experimental data.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "A. V. MALYSHEV [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Y. S.
