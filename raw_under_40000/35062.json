{"Nomor": 35062, "Judul": "A Novel Rate Of The Reaction Between Naoh With CO2 At Low Temperature In Spray Dryer", "Abstrak": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an influential greenhouse gas that has a significant impact on global\nwarming partly. Nowadays, many techniques are available to control and remove CO2 in different\nchemical processes. Since the spray dryer has high removal efficiency rate, a laboratory-scale spray\ndryer is used to absorb carbon dioxide from air in aqueous solution of NaOH. In the present study,\nthe impact of NaOH concentration, operating temperature and nozzle diameter on removal efficiency of CO2 is explored through experimental study. Moreover, the reaction kinetic of NaOH with\nCO2 is studied over the temperature range of 50e100 C in a laboratory-scale spray dryer absorber.\nIn the present contribution, a simple reaction rate equation is proposed that shows the lowest\ndeviation from the experimental data with error less than 2%.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yadollah Tavan  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Seyyed Hossein Hosseini"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "CO2, Kinetic, Spray dryer, NaOH", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 3, Issue 1, Pages 51-55 (March 2017)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Feb 2019"}
