{"Nomor": 35076, "Judul": "Signatures of Enhanced Superconducting Phase Coherence in Optimally Doped Bi2Sr2Y0.08Ca0.92Cu2O8+? Driven by Midinfrared Pulse Excitations", "Abstrak": "Optimally doped cuprate are characterized by the presence of superconducting fluctuations in a\nrelatively large temperature region above the critical transition temperature. We reveal here that the effect\nof thermal disorder, which decreases the condensate phase coherence at equilibrium, can be dynamically\ncontrasted by photoexcitation with ultrashort midinfrared pulses. In particular, our findings reveal that light\npulses with photon energy comparable to the amplitude of the superconducting gap and polarized in plane\nalong the copper-copper direction can dynamically enhance the optical response associated with the onset\nof superconductivity. We propose that this effect can be rationalized by an effective d-wave BCS model,\nwhich reveals that midinfrared pulses result in a transient increase of the phase coherence.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "F.
