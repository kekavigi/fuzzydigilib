{"Nomor": 34007, "Judul": "GEOMETRICALLY ASYMMETRIC OPTICAL CAVITY FOR STRONG ATOM-PHOTON COUPLING", "Abstrak": "Optical cavities are widely used to enhance the interaction between atoms and light. Typical designs using a geometrically symmetric structure in the near-concentric regime face a tradeoff between mechanical stability and high single-atom cooperativity. To overcome this limitation, we design and implement a geometrically asymmetric standing-wave cavity. This structure, with mirrors of very different radii of curvature, allows strong atom-light coupling while exhibiting good stability against misalignment. We observe effective cooperativities ranging from ?eff = 10 to ?eff = 0.2 by shifting the location of the atoms in the cavity mode. By loading 171Yb atoms directly from a mirror magneto-optical trap into a one-dimensional optical lattice along the cavity mode, we produce atomic ensembles with collective cooperativities up to N? = 2 \u00d7 104. This system opens a way to preparing spin squeezing for an optical lattice clock and to accessing a range of nonclassical collective states.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "AKIO KAWASAKI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["BORIS BRAVERMAN,", "EDWIN PEDROZO-PE\u00d1AFIEL,", "CHI SHU,", "SIMONE COLOMBO,", "ZEYANG LI,1 \u00d6ZGE \u00d6ZEL,", "WENLAN CHEN,", "LEONARDO SALVI,", "ANDR\u00c9 HEINZ", "DAVID LEVONIAN,", "DAISUKE AKAMATSU,", "YANHONG XIAO,", "AND VLADAN VULETI\u00b4C,"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW A 99, 013437 (2019); \u00a92019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Feb 2019"}
