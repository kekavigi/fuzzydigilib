{"Nomor": 33464, "Judul": "Stellar siblings grow closer with age", "Abstrak": "Stars with masses more than eight times that of the Sun are most often found in binary systems, in which two stars orbit their common centre of mass. Such high-mass stars lead rapid and violent lives, supply the Universe with a large portion of its heavy elements and can be the progenitors of binary black-hole systems that produce gravitational waves1. Writing in Astronomy & Astrophysics,Sana et al. 2 report that high-mass stars in young binaries have longer orbital periods than those in older ones. These results could be used to test predictions based on theories of the formation of high-mass stars, and suggest that mechanisms act to reduce the orbital periods of stars in binaries during their adolescence.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "AARON M.
