{"Nomor": 35248, "Judul": "Well Selection In Depleted Oil And Gas Fields For A Safe CO2 Storage Practice: A Case Study From Malaysia", "Abstrak": "Carbon capture and sequestration technology is recognized as a successful approach taken to\nmitigate the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. However, having a successful storage practice requires wise selection of suitable wells in depleted oil or gas fields to\nreduce the risk of leakage and contamination of subsurface resources. The aim of this paper is to\npresent a guideline which can be followed to provide a better understanding of sophisticated wells\nchosen for injection and storage practices. Reviewing recent studies carried out on different aspects\nof geosequestration indicated that the fracture pressure of seals and borehole conditions such as\ncement-sheath integrity, distance from faults and fractures together with the depth of wells are\nimportant parameters, which should be part of the analysis for well selection in depleted reservoirs. A workflow was then designed covering these aspects and it was applied to a depleted gas\nfield in Malaysia. The results obtained indicated that Well B in the field may have the potential of\nbeing a suitable conduit for injection. Although more studies are required to consider other aspects\nof well selections, it is recommended to employ the formation integrity analysis as part of the\ncaprock assessment before making any decisions.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Arshad Raza  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Raoof Gholami", "Reza Rezaee", "Chua Han Bing", "Ramasamy Nagarajan", "Mohamed Ali Hamid"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "CO2 storage, Injection wells, Leakage, Carbonate reservoir, Malaysia", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 3, Issue 1, Pages 167-177 (March 2017)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Feb 2019"}
