{"Nomor": 36682, "Judul": "FALCON 9 ROCKET MODELING & LAUNCH SIMULATION WITH THRUST VECTORING CONTROL", "Abstrak": "Falcon 9 rocket launched simulator based on MATLAB/Simulink is created\nto simulate the ascent trajectory starting from initial launch point through to\ninsertion point (reaching orbital speed, altitude, flight path angle). That simulator\ncompleted by dynamic models of the Falcon 9 rocket, incorporating its weight and\nbalance model, propulsion model, aerodynamics model, environmental, control\nand six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) equation of motion. The influenced of\naerodynamic forces and moments which acting on the rocket during flight through\nthe atmosphere cause must be designed a attitude control system (pitch control) to\nstabilize the rocket using Thrust Vectoring Control (TVC).\nTwo cases of Falcon 9 launch simulation will carried out they are open loop\nsystem and closed loop control system. Open loop system will discuss about the\nnon-linear system simulation (without aerodynamic moments, longitudinal dynamic\nstability and full aerodynamics) and also linearized system simulation. Closed loop\ncontrol system will discuss about the linearized system simulation and\nimplementing the linearization process to the non-linear system (longitudinal\ndynamic stability). After that we compare the open loop and closed loop result with\nthe Falcon 9 exist data and analyze it.", "Daftar File": {"2019_TA_PP_I_WAYAN_WIRA_HANDIKA_SUARJAYA_1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/162803"}, "Penulis": "I Wayan Wira Handika Suarjaya [13614014]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Yazdi Ibrahim Jenie, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Falcon 9, Ascent Trajectory, Thrust Vectoring Control", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Mar 2019"}
