Initially, PANI nanofibers were prepared\nwith the use of ultrasound assisted emulsion polymerization method. Then the prepared PANI nanofibers\nwere dispersed in base fluid in varying concentration (0.1\u20130.5 vol%) in order to get uniformly dispersed\nPANI nanofluid in the presence of sonication. The effect of PANI nanofibers concentration in nanofluid and\nReynolds number on heat transfer coefficient have been investigated in helical coiled heat exchanger. It\nwas found that the average heat transfer coefficient increases with an increase in the volume% of PANI\nnanofibers in nanofluid and Reynolds number. The heat transfer coefficient of base fluid i.e. distilled\nwater was found to be 304 W/m2 C (at xi/D = 692.3) whereas it was found to be increased to\n515.8 W/m2 C (at xi/D = 692.3) for 0.5 vol% PANI concentration in nanofluid. The percentage enhancement\nin the heat transfer coefficient was found to be 10.52% at 0.1 vol% of PANI nanofibers in nanofluid\nand was found to be increased to 69.62% for 0.5 vol% of PANI nanofibers.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "B.A. Bhanvase [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["S.D.
