{"Nomor": 37673, "Judul": "Blind subjects faces database", "Abstrak": "Using your face to unlock a mobile device is not only an appealing security solution, but also a desirable or\nentertaining feature that is comparable with taking selfies. It is convenient, fast, and does not require much effort. Nevertheless, for users with visual impairments, taking selfies could potentially be a challenging task. In order to study the usability and ensure the inclusion of mobile-based identity authentication technology, the authors have collected the blind-subject face database (BSFDB). Ensuring that technology is accessible to disabled people is important because they account for about 15% of the world population. The BSFDB contains some 40 individuals with visual disabilities who took selfies with a mock-up mobile device. The database comes with four experimental protocols which are defined by a dichotomy of two controlled covariates, namely, whether or not a subject is guided by audio feedback and whether or not he/she has received explicit instructions to take the selfie. The findings suggest the importance of appropriate design of human computer interaction as well as alternative feedback design based on the audio cue. All the data is available online including more than 70, 000 detected face images of blind and partially blind subjects.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Norman Poh [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ramon Blanco-Gonzalo, Rita Wong, Raul Sanchez-Reillo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Mobile Biometrics", "Sumber": "IET Biometrics", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Apr 2019"}
