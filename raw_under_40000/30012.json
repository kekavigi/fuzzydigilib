{"Nomor": 30012, "Judul": "RISK ANALYSIS ESTIMATION OF LEMBANG FAULT EARTHQUAKE CASUALTY IN COBLONG, BANDUNG", "Abstrak": "Being located in the area that has high tectonic activity makes Indonesia has a big risk of being struck by disaster such as earthquake. One of the causes of earthquake in West Java, especially Coblong district, is Lembang fault. Earthquakes caused by Lembang Fault have great impact on society. Some of the impacts include structural building damages and a great number of casualties. These possible losses are called risk of disaster. With regard to reduce the risk of disaster, a risk management should be applied. Risk management can be executed by estimating the number of casualty. The number of casualty is estimated by analyzing earthquake event is the hazard, population and building distribution as the exposure and the building-fragility curve as the vulnerability data. This undergraduate thesis uses magnitude 6 and 7 earthquake in the hazard data. Earthquake acceleration data together with building fragility curve obtains probability of damaged building number. And the casualty estimation itself is derived directly from building damage using casualty event tree model from HAZUS method. Also, spatial modeling is needed to process those data and display the result. As the result, Lembang Fault earthquake could cost casualties in Coblong around 0.6% and 1.5% of its total population in magnitude 6 and 7 respectively from 36.6% damaged buildings in magnitude 6 and 55.6% damaged buildings in magnitude 7.", "Daftar File": {"2016 TA PP PUTI NABILA RIYADI1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/137720", "2016 TA PP PUTI NABILA RIYADI1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/137721", "2016 TA PP PUTI NABILA RIYADI1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/137722", "2016 TA PP PUTI NABILA RIYADI1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/137723", "2016 TA PP PUTI NABILA RIYADI1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/137724", "2016 TA PP PUTI NABILA RIYADI1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/137725"}, "Penulis": "PUTI NABILA RIYADI (NIM : 15113004)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["#CONTRIBUTOR#"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Earthquake, Casualty Estimation, HAZUS Method, Spatial Modeling", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Alice D", "File": "6 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Agu 2018"}
