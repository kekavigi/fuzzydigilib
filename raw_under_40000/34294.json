{"Nomor": 34294, "Judul": "A critical review on ammonium recovery from wastewater for sustainable wastewater management", "Abstrak": "The growing global population\u2019s demand for ammonium has triggered an increase in its supply, given that\nammonium plays a crucial role in fertilizer production for the purpose of food security. Currently, ammonia used\nin fertilizer production is put through what is known as the industrial Haber Bosch process, but this approach is\nsubstantially expensive and requires much energy. For this reason, looking for effective methods to recover\nammonium is important for environmental sustainability. One of the greatest opportunities for ammonium recovery occurs in wastewater treatment plants due to wastewater containing a large quantity of ammonium ions.\nThe comprehensively and critically review studies on ammonium recovery conducted, have the potential to be\napplied in current wastewater treatment operations. Technologies and their ammonium recovery mechanisms\nare included in this review. Furthermore the economic feasibility of such processes is analysed. Possible future\ndirections for ammonium recovery from wastewater are suggested.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yuanyao Ye [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Huu Hao Ngo.,Wenshan Guo., Yiwen Liu.,Soon Woong Chang.,Dinh Duc Nguyen.,Heng Liang.,Jie Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Ammonium recovery Wastewater Struvite precipitation Ammonium salts Membrane hybrid system", "Sumber": "Bioresource Technology 268 (2018) 749\u2013758", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Feb 2019"}
