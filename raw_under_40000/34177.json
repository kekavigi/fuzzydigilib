{"Nomor": 34177, "Judul": "Removal of cadmium from wastewaters with low-cost adsorbents", "Abstrak": "Instead of using commercial activated carbon or ion exchange resins, researchers have worked on inexpensive\nmaterials, such as wastes from industry and agricultural operations due to their outstanding adsorption behavior\ntoward heavy metal ions. Low-cost adsorbents are easily and locally available in large quantities. The modification of these materials could considerably increase their sorption capacity. In this review, the technical\nfeasibility of various low-cost adsorbents for removal of Cd(II) from wastewaters has been discussed. Due to\nwidespread cadmium contamination and its toxicity, there is considerable interest to remove it before discharge\ninto wastewater streams. Several factors affecting an adsorption process such as pH, contact time as well as the\nreported maximum adsorption capacity values are summarized. The subsequent regeneration and reuse of adsorbents has been given considerable attention and some adsorption studies using real wastewater samples were\nalso discussed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Krystyna Pyrzynska [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Cadmium Adsorption Low-cost adsorbents Wastewater", "Sumber": "Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering 7 (2019) 102795", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Feb 2019"}
