Coal seam channel waves are particularly promising because they only propagate in coal seams\nand are sensitive to changes in seam thickness and local geological structure. Previous channel wave studies focused mostly on medium-thick coal seams, while channel wave signal characteristics in thin coal seams remain\npoorly understood. We have conducted experiments on the transmission of channel waves in a 1-m thick coal\nseam using triaxial velocity geophones and acceleration geophones embedded in the coal seam and its roof\nand floor rock mass to better understand guided wave characteristics in thin coal seams. We find that a widefrequency triaxial acceleration geophone with stable amplitude-frequency characteristics enables collection of\nall of the 1-m thick coal seam guided wave information. However, the velocity geophones did not effectively respond to different coal seam guided waves. Signal analysis reveals that the thin coal seam channel wave features\nwith an Airy seismic phase frequency of 570 Hz and velocity of 950 m/s. There was a high-energy and highfrequency guided wave between the P and S direct waves of the coal seam roof and floor. Combined with\ntime-frequency analysis, polarization analysis, and numerical simulation, the guided wave is inferred to be a PP interference wave with potential exploration value propagating in the same direction along the roof and\nfloor of the coal seam. Acceleration geophones with a wide frequency band and stable sensitivity are therefore\nthe key point to acquiring coal seam channel wave exploration data", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP JUN ZHANG 1": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/171046"}, "Penulis": "Jun Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Shengdong Liu, Bo Wang, Haiping Yang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Channel wave Velocity geophone Acceleration geophone Amplitude-frequency characteristic", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 166 (2019) 112\u2013121, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2019.05.004", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Jun 2019"}
