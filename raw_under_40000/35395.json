{"Nomor": 35395, "Judul": "Time reverse locating of noise source based on isotime point imaging", "Abstrak": "In seismic exploration, a noise source is simply described as a source producing stochastic vibration continuously.\nThe first arrival or events of a noise source are generally unpickable. Hence it's more appropriate to use the time\nreverse imaging (TRI) for locating noise source rather than the travel time inversion. In this paper, we introduce\nTRI into the noise source locating. Hybrid imaging condition and random selection of receiver positions in back\npropagation are used to improve the effect and reliability of imaging result. For identifying the source, the local\nmaxima of imaging result are extracted, combining with a statistical threshold. Besides, we propose an imaging\nmethod based on isotime point: taking imaging points as sources, and calculating the travel time around them\nrespectively; picking several points on one or more isotime lines (which are called isotime points), and using\nthe back propagated wavefield sequences at these points to conduct imaging. Again, a threshold is used to identify\nsources. Combination of results of the conventional method and that from the isotime point imaging helps\neliminate artifacts. Homogenous and complex models are illustrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod and its resistance to white noise", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Qixin Ge [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Liguo Han"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Noise source Locating Imaging Isotime", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 159 (2018) 38\u201351, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.07.015", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Feb 2019"}
