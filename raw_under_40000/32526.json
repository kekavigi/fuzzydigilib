{"Nomor": 32526, "Judul": "Evaluation of commercially available polylactic acid (PLA) filaments for 3D printing applications", "Abstrak": "Abstract\nPolylactic acid (PLA) is a biodegradable and bioresorbable biopolymer that has successfully been applied in biomedical\nand related fields. It is in the form of filaments, presenting different colors, with the purpose to be used in the threedimensional\nprinting (3D) technique. Thus, this work aimed to characterize five commercially available PLA filaments\nwhich were differentiated by color, as follows: blue (1), gray (2), transparent (3), orange (4) and natural (5) comparing to a\npellet pattern. Thermal characterization was performed throughout simultaneous thermogravimetry (TG), derivative\nthermogravimetry (DTG), differential thermal analysis (DTA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Significant\ndifferences in the enthalpies and temperatures of crystallization and melting indicated differences in crystallinity of the\nfilaments corroborated by the XRD analysis. While analyzing using TG/DTG\u2013DTA, significant differences in thermal\nstability were observed. The absorption spectroscopy in the infrared was also done to determine the chemical composition\nof the samples. Additionally, it was also observed the structure, size and roughness of the filaments using confocal\nmicroscopy building three-dimensional images. The oscillatory rheometer was employed to determinate the complex\nviscosity (g), the store modulus (G0) and the loss modulus (G00) as a function of frequency (x). After conducting the\ncharacterizations, it was possible to compare the five types of PLA filaments and identify the best one to feature a\nfunctionalization in the future, which possibly enable them in tissue engineering applications. Results indicated that the\nblue filament fulfilled the best results regarding print quality, higher-temperature degradation and thermal stability, with the\nmolar mass and viscosity superior to the other filaments.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "BRUNA DRIUSSI MISTRO MATOS [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Valmir Rocha", "Eraldo Jannone da Silva", "Franco Henrique Moro", "Alex Camilli Bottene", "Clovis Augusto Ribeiro", "Diogenes dos Santos Dias", "Selma Gutierrez Antonio", "Andre\u00b4 Capaldo do Amaral", "Sandra Andrea Cruz", "Helida Gomes de Oliveira Barud", "Hernane da Silva Ba", ""], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "PLA filaments  Confocal microscopy  FTIR spectra  Thermal stability  XRD  Rheological analysis", "Sumber": "Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry https://doi.org/10.1007/s10973-018-7967-3(0123456789().,-volV)(0123456789().,-volV)", "Staf Input/Edit": "SYSTEM", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
