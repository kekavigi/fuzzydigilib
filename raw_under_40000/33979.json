{"Nomor": 33979, "Judul": "Iterative deblending of simultaneous-source data using smoothed singular spectrum analysis", "Abstrak": "Simultaneous-source acquisition helps the field crews obtain a faster seismic data recording by allowing multiple\nsources to be fired simultaneously. However, the simultaneous source ignition causes strong interferences in the\nrecorded data,which greatly affects the subsequent seismic data processing and imaging workflows. An effective\nseparation of simultaneous sources is considered as the key in successfully utilizing the simultaneous-source\nacquisition technology. In this paper, we propose a novel smoothed singular spectrum analysis (SSA) approach\nto remove blending noise in an iterative inversion manner. Compared with the traditional SSA approach, the\nsmoothed SSA approach applies a Gaussian smoothing operator onto the Hankelmatrix in the frequency domain,\nand can attenuate more blending noise than the traditional SSA method. Weuse both synthetic and field data examples\nto demonstrate the successful performance of the proposed method", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Min Bai [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Juan Wu, Hua Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Seismic imaging Seismic data processing Simultaneous source Deblending", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 161 (2019) 261\u2013269, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.10.015", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Feb 2019"}
