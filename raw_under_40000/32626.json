In This research study looked for bacterial strains have ability to\ndegrade petroleum oily pollutants. Two bacterial isolates from 23 isolates\nhave high ability to degrade engine oil were characterized and identified. The\ntwo bacterial isolates have been identified phenotypically and genotypically\nmethods, as Bacillus subtilis strain BS1 and Bacillus axarquiensis strain BA1,\nthese deposited in national center for biotechnology information (NCBI Gen\nBank) under the Accession numbers MF375213.1 and MF375110.1\nrespectively. Two isolated strains have ability to grow in minimal medium\ncontaining petroleum oil with maximum bacterial growth was determined by\nspectrophotometry. Bacillus subtilis growth exhibited 1.7 OD at 600nm after 2\ndays of incubation time whereas Bacillus axarquiensis exhibited 1.14 OD at\n600 nm after 3 days of incubation time with minimal medium containing 2%\npetroleum oil.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ELSAYED K.
