It offers a critique \nof both the modernist framework, which sees culture as development\u2019s other as \nwell as the post-development tendency to exaggerate local cultures as the space of \ngenuine development. Instead, it makes a case for approaching culture as a site of \nconformity and contestation and where development realities are produced, thus \nmaking  development  a  temporal  and  discursive  construct.  The  questions  that  \nguide this paper are whether culture exists as a fixed essence on which development \nworks  in  an  antagonistic  relationship  or  development  constructs  culture  in  a  \ncomplementary alliance, and whether culture is a homogeneous space of belonging \nor a slippery site where multiple meanings and truths scramble for legitimacy. \nThese  questions  are  answered  by  drawing  from,  and  expanding  on,  existing  \ncultural development literature, as well as by engaging with two environmental \nmovements from India", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jyotirmaya Tripathy [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Culture, contemporary, environment", "Sumber": "Journal of Global South Studies.
