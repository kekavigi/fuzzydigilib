{"Nomor": 35110, "Judul": "Discontinuous fatigue of salt rock with low-stress intervals", "Abstrak": "When used as compressive air energy storages, underground salt caverns are often subjected to discontinuous\ncyclic force, characterized by low-stress time intervals (LSIs). In this study, discontinuous cyclic loading tests\nwere conducted to evaluate the effect of LSIs on the fatigue performance of salt rock. The results show that the\nfatigue life of the specimen subjected to discontinuous cyclic compression decreased sharply in comparison with\nconventional fatigue tests (i.e. continuous cyclic loading tests). The residual strain in S cycles (which follow the\nLSIs) developed more rapidly than in N cycles (where there is no preceding LSI). Elastic axial deformation in S\ncycles was smaller, whereas the elastic lateral deformation is zero both in S cycles and N cycles. Similar phenomena for discontinuous fatigue were also observed in discontinuous cyclic shear tests. The mechanism of\ndiscontinuous fatigue is the dislocation-related Bauschinger effect which is induced by reverse movement under\nresidual stress during LSIs", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jinyang Fan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Deyi Jian,  Wei Liu, Fei Wu, Jie Chen, and JJk Daemen"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Cyclic loading, Low-stress interval, Plastic strain, Residual stress, Compressed air energy storage", "Sumber": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrmms.2019.01.013", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Feb 2019"}
