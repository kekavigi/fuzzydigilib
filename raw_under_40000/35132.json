{"Nomor": 35132, "Judul": "Economic Geographies of Brands and Branding", "Abstrak": "Brands and branding are an underinvestigated area ineconomic geography. Despite their pervasive growthas  sources  and  carriers  of  meaning  and  value,  the economic   geographic   dimensions   of   brands   and branding    lack    conceptual    clarity    and    remain undertheorized.  This  article  introduces  the  idea  of geographical  associations  to  provide  stronger  conceptual  and  theoretical  foundations  to  explain  the importance and role of brands and branding in economic  geographies.  It  then  builds  on  and  critically examines  the  worth  of  this  understanding  in  anempirical exploration of the Burberry brand and itsbranding  in  the  luxury  fashion  business. The  argument is that conceiving of the geographical associations   constituting   the   economic   geographies   of\nbrands and branding explains their role as means of cohering and stabilizing meaning and value in spatialcircuits. Concerted attention to brands and branding can broaden the reach of economic geography in its intersections between cultural and political economy.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ANDY PIKE [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "brands branding geographies Britishness Burberry luxury fashio", "Sumber": "Centre for Urban and Regional Development Studies School of Geography, Politics and Sociology Newcastle University Newcastle upon Tyne United Kingdom", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos \u00a0\n                                     Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Feb 2019"}
