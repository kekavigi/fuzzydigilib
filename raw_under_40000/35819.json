{"Nomor": 35819, "Judul": "Accumulated energy norm for full waveform inversion of marine data", "Abstrak": "Macro-velocity models are important for imaging the subsurface structure. However, the conventional objective\nfunctions of full waveform inversion in the time and the frequency domain have a limited ability to recover the\nmacro-velocity model because of the absence of low-frequency information. In this study, we propose new objective functions that can recover the macro-velocity model by minimizing the difference between the zerofrequency components of the square of seismic traces. Instead of the seismic trace itself, we use the square of\nthe trace, which contains low-frequency information. We apply several time windows to the trace and obtain\nzero-frequency information of the squared trace for each time window. The shape of the new objective functions\nshows that they are suitable for local optimization methods. Since we use the acoustic wave equation in this\nstudy, this method can be used for deep-sea marine data, in which elastic effects can be ignored. We show that\nthe zero-frequency components of the square of the seismic traces can be used to recover macro-velocities\nfrom synthetic and field data", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Changsoo Shin  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wansoo Ha"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Inverse theory Computational seismology Seismic tomography", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 147 (2017) 91\u2013101, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.10.005", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Mar 2019"}
