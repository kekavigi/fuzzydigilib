{"Nomor": 35872, "Judul": "The data of Escherichia coli strains genes in different types of wastewater", "Abstrak": "From April 2016 to March 2017, a number of 99 isolates of\nEscherichia coli were collected from three types of wastewater\nincluding urban wastewater (33 isolates), livestock slaughterhouse\nwastewater (33 isolates) and poultry slaughterhouse wastewater\n(33 isolate). The specimens were cultured on microbiological\nmedia. The bacterial identification was performed by morphological and biochemical tests. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\nmethod was carried out to detect 2 virulence genes (traT, and\nfimH) and 4 antibiotic resistance genes (bla TEM, CTX, SHV, and tetA).\nThe data showed that the prevalence rate of traT, fimH,blaCTX,\nblaTEM,blaSHV, tetA genes were 89.9%, 91.9%, 79.8%, 40.4%, 6.1%,\nand 91.9%, respectively.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mojtaba Afsharnia  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Behnaz Naraghi.,Jalal Mardaneh.,Mojtaba Kianmehr., Hamed Biglari"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Escherichia coli Wastewater Virulence genes Resistance genes Antibiotic resistance", "Sumber": "Data in Brief 21 (2018) 763\u2013766", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Mar 2019"}
