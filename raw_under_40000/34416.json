{"Nomor": 34416, "Judul": "Characterization and thermal decomposition of demineralized wastewater algae biomass", "Abstrak": "Demineralization pretreatments by leaching using different solvents including deionized water (DI-H2O), acetic\nacid, formic acid, and sulfuric acid were evaluated for their ash removal efficiency and effects on the physical\nstructure, chemical composition and thermal behavior of wastewater algae biomass (WA). The apparent activation energy of the thermal decomposition (Ea) was estimated using isoconversional methods proposed by\nFriedman, Flynn-Wall-Ozawa, and Kissinger-Ahakira-Sunose. Dilute-acid leaching substantially reduced the ash\ncontent in WA from 40.07% dw (dry weight) to as low as 25.70% dw, with the higher heating value (HHV)\nconsiderably improved from 13.08 MJ/kg up to 15.84 MJ/kg. Leaching using formic acid was found the most\neffective (36.86% ash removal efficiency), while DI-H2O was the least effective (2.94% ash removal efficiency)\nin reducing the ash content in WA. Both formic acid and sulfuric acid treatments resulted in a decreased of Ea by\n10% and 7%, respectively, while no significant change was observed with acetic acid treatment. These results\nsuggest that selective dilute-acid leaching can improve the thermal decomposition of WA, which may benefit\nsubsequent thermochemical conversion processes.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Rowena B.
