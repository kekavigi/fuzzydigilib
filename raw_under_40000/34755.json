The art comes into life from the needs of human beings. Therefore the formation of these intersections are not so surprising for the art era.The aim of this paper is to set forth the association of architecture and ceramic art and interaction between them especially by means of the abstraction of contemporary ceramic artworks.Notions like inner space and outer space are mostly considered basic concepts of ceramic art. This conceptual consideration gains an importance when these concepts are viewed from the architectural perspective. Because these notions are also basic notions of architecture. While architecture transforms these notions into forms, it also creates outer spaces for the ceramic artworks. In this paper some chosen examples of ceramics are referenced from the ancient times until 20th century (when ceramic was accepted as an art discipline to express the ancient association of these two art disciplines. Then the artworks of contemporary ceramic artists are featured in terms of conceptual basis, styles, production methods and processes, and the opportunities that comes from the nature of ceramic materials. Abstracting the expressions of the contemporary ceramic artists in the architectural manner, resulted as the displaying how do these two art disciplines come together on the concept of inner and outer space.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "OLGU SUMENGEN BERKER [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "ceramic art architecture contemporary ceramics", "Sumber": "Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 191 ( 2015 ) 291 \u2013 295", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Feb 2019"}
