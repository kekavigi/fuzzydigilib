{"Nomor": 33266, "Judul": "Tight carbonate reservoir characterization based on the modified rock physics model", "Abstrak": "Because tight carbonate reservoirs have outstanding potential of reserves and economic benefits, it is significant\nto recognize their typical geophysical responses using rock physics models. Nevertheless, conventional models\nare not satisfactory to interpret multi-scale or in-situ observations, since their computational generalization. To\nenhance the predictive and computational power, this paper derives an upscale rock physics model which includes\nboth modeling and inverting schemes. Its main idea is to study and utilize inherent statistical natures in\nnaturally occurring tight carbonate rocks. Through extending the typical critical porosity model (CPM), our\nmodeling scheme relates pore systemtowave propagation and fluid flowresponses in dolomite-calcite mixtures.\nThus, it can recognize the effect of pore structure changes on velocity and permeability heterogeneity. On the\nother hand, in terms of deterministic and probabilistic methods, pore systems can be characterized within different\nscopes of observations. It also allows a model based inverting scheme for data interpretation and correction,\naccording to the statistical comparability between lab measurements andwell logs. Therefore, if mineralogy contents\nand noisy sonic logging curves are available, one can simultaneously obtain the corrected porosity, permeability\nand velocity curves. In site data tests, predictive power of this model is well demonstrated by the high data\nconsistency.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Bonan Li [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hui Shen, Shouli Qu, Ding Wang, Cai Liu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Tight carbonate reservoirs Rock physics model Pore type classification Permeability heterogeneity evaluation Logging curves correction", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 159 (2018) 374\u2013385, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.09.012", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Jan 2019"}
