{"Nomor": 35644, "Judul": "Leni Riefenstahl and German expressionism: research in Visual Cultural Studies using the trans- disciplinary semantic spaces  of specialized dictionaries", "Abstrak": "This  paper  reports  on  an  analysis  of  the  work  of  Leni  Riefenstahl,  and  German expressionism, through the use of trans-disciplinary semantic associative search in  specialized  databased  dictionaries1.  Within  this  database  space  (Kitagawaand  Kiyokim  1993),  the  quantitative  data  of  objects  as  representation  can  be visualized  by  number.  While  the  method  of  image  analysis  is  qualitative,  it  is based on a quantitative analysis of visual representation. Through this analysis, Riefenstahl\u2019s film Olympia \u2013 Fest der V\u00f6lker is compared with the Nazi ideology of  the  body  image.  The  film  is  often  categorized  as  \u2018romantic\u2019;  however,  this\npaper  proposes  a  new  interpretation  based  on  theories  of  Jonathan  Crary,  and Martin Jay, which are combined using the mechanism of connotation in searching database systems. We proposs that, in the context of Visual Culture Studies, the  use  of  digital  technologies  may  provide  new  possibilities  for  research  in  the humanities.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yukihiko Yoshida [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Expressionism (Art); national socialism & art", "Sumber": "Technoetic Arts: A Journal of Speculative Research Volume 6 Number 3", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Feb 2019"}
