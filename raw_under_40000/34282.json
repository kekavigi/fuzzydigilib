{"Nomor": 34282, "Judul": "An \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdisolated diffusion\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd gravimetric calibration procedure for radar and microwave moisture measurement in porous building stone", "Abstrak": "Information about the presence and movement of water is crucial to understanding stone\ndeterioration and rock weathering but hard to obtain. Non-destructive, non-invasive measurements\nof electromagnetic phenomena can provide proxy data on water contents within porous stone and\nrock. Commercial geophysical devices, such as radar and microwave moisture sensors, produce\nraw data or readings in arbitrary units, but can be related to absolute water contents through\ngravimetric calibration. Calibration procedures typically either equilibrate samples to a set of\nrelative humidities (RH%) using salt solutions or environmental chambers (requiring specialised\nequipment), or monitor ambient drying which yields less homogenous moisture distributions and\ntakes time. This study proposes and tests a cost- and time-effective \u2018isolated diffusion\u2019 gravimetric\ncalibration procedure in which a set of samples are sealed at specific water contents and\nequilibrated. The procedure is compared to ambient drying over 120 h for three United Kingdom\nbuilding stones and evaluated with modelled reflection coefficients and relative permittivities. The\ncalibrations determined from isolated diffusion more closely follow modelled behaviour than\nthose from ambient drying, as the calibrations developed from the latter were affected by uneven distributions of moisture. Calibrations for radar measurements developed from two types of back\ninterfaces (air and metal) were very similar to one another, suggesting that measurements are\nconsistent regardless of the type of back interface used. The isolated diffusion calibration\nprocedure provides a cost-effective and simple method to facilitate comparison between different\nnon-destructive testing methods and enables accurate measurement of water contents in porous\ngeomaterials.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Scott Allan Orr [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Maureen Young, Dawson Stelfox, Alick Leslie, Joanne Curran, Heather Viles"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "natural stone, cultural heritage, infrastructure, modelling, material properties, GPR", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics, S0926-9851(18)30715-8 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2019.02.003", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Feb 2019"}
