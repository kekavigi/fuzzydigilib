{"Nomor": 34403, "Judul": "Multichannel block sparse Bayesian learning reflectivity inversion with lp-norm criterion-based Q estimation", "Abstrak": "The generation of attenuated seismic reflection data can be described via a nonstationary convolution model with\nquality factor Q. In according with the linear matrix-matrix multiplication operation that is deduced to depict the\nmultichannel nonstationary seismic received signal, we present a spatially correlated reflectivity inversion\napproach with the Q estimation based on block sparse Bayesian learning (bSBL) and an lp-norm criterion. In contrast to pre-existingtime-variant deconvolution, the proposed technique can eliminate the wavelet-filtering and\nQ-filtering effect simultaneously and retrieve an optimal reflectivity matrix without providing Q value by anticipation. Through introducing the lp-norm criterion and scanning Q strategy, we could capture the optimal Q to\ncalculate the blurring operator in the inversion function. The inverted reflectivity result will be satisfied with presupposition that multi-trace reflectivity is comparatively sparse corresponding to its minimum lp-norm when the\noptimal Q structure is applied to build the attenuation equation. In reflectivity inversion area, the relationship\namong reflection spikes in adjacent traces as a priori information is represented by a covariance matrix of reflectivity model in the bSBL framework and assists in solving procedure to promote the inversion precision. To\ndiminish the influence of man-made parameter selection, the hyperparameters of reflectivity and noise model\nare estimated in virtue of expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The contribution of spatial correlation\ncould guarantee a higher quality of reflectivity image. New method merges the multichannel reflectivity inversion and Q estimation into a single processing and avoids the drawback of the conventional Q extraction technique. Synthetic and field data sets prove the practicality of the developed technique and indicate the\nfavorable anti-noise capability", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ming Ma [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Shangxu Wang, Sanyi Yuan, Jianhu Gao, Shengjun Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Nonstationary Q estimation lp-norm Block sparse Bayesian learning Reflectivity inversion", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 159 (2018) 434\u2013445,  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.09.016", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Feb 2019"}
