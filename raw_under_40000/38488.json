{"Nomor": 38488, "Judul": "Switchable Charge Injection Barrier in an Organic Supramolecular Semiconductor", "Abstrak": "We disclose a supramolecular material that combines semiconducting and dipolar functionalities. The material consists of a discotic\nsemiconducting carbonyl-bridged triarylamine core, which is surrounded by\nthree dipolar amide groups. In thin films, the material self-organizes in a\nhexagonal columnar fashion through ?-stacking of the molecular core and\nhydrogen bonding between the amide groups. Alignment by an electrical field\nin a simple metal/semiconductor/metal geometry induces a polar order in the\ninterface layers near the metal contacts that can be reversibly switched, while\nthe bulk material remains nonpolarized. On suitably chosen electrodes, the\npresence of an interfacial polarization field leads to a modulation of the barrier\nfor charge injection into the semiconductor. Consequently, a reversible\nswitching is possible between a high-resistance, injection-limited off-state and a\nlow-resistance, space-charge-limited on-state. The resulting memory diode\nshows switchable rectification with on/off ratios of up to two orders of\nmagnitude. This demonstrated multifunctionality of a single material is a promising concept toward possible application in lowcost, large-area, nonvolatile organic memories.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Andrey V.
