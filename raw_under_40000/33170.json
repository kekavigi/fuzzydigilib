{"Nomor": 33170, "Judul": "Application Of Artificial Intelligence To Forecast Hydrocarbon Production From Shales", "Abstrak": "Artificial intelligence (AI) methods and applications have recently gained a great deal of attention in\nmany areas, including fields of mathematics, neuroscience, economics, engineering, linguistics, gaming,\nand many others. This is due to the surge of innovative and sophisticated AI techniques applications to\nhighly complex problems as well as the powerful new developments in high speed computing. Various\napplications of AI in everyday life include machine learning, pattern recognition, robotics, data processing and analysis, etc. The oil and gas industry is not behind either, in fact, AI techniques have recently\nbeen applied to estimate PVT properties, optimize production, predict recoverable hydrocarbons, optimize well placement using pattern recognition, optimize hydraulic fracture design, and to aid in reservoir\ncharacterization efforts. In this study, three different AI models are trained and used to forecast hydrocarbon production from hydraulically fractured wells. Two vastly used artificial intelligence methods,\nnamely the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) and the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), are\ncompared to a traditional curve fitting method known as Response Surface Model (RSM) using second\norder polynomial equations to determine production from shales. The objective of this work is to further\nexplore the potential of AI in the oil and gas industry. Eight parameters are considered as input factors to\nbuild the model: reservoir permeability, initial dissolved gas-oil ratio, rock compressibility, gas relative\npermeability, slope of gas oil ratio, initial reservoir pressure, flowing bottom hole pressure, and hydraulic\nfracture spacing. The range of values used for these parameters resemble real field scenarios from prolific\nshale plays such as the Eagle Ford, Bakken, and the Niobrara in the United States. Production data\nconsists of oil recovery factor and produced gas-oil ratio (GOR) generated from a generic hydraulically\nfractured reservoir model using a commercial simulator. The Box-Behnken experiment design was used\nto minimize the number of simulations for this study. Five time-based models (for production periods of\n90 days, 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, and 15 years) and one rate-based model (when oil rate drops to 5 bbl/\nday/fracture) were considered. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) routine is used in all three surrogate\nmodels to obtain the associated model parameters. Models were trained using 80% of all data generated\nthrough simulation while 20% was used for testing of the models. All models were evaluated by\nmeasuring the goodness of fit through the coefficient of determination (R2\n) and the Normalized Root\nMean Square Error (NRMSE). Results show that RSM and LSSVM have very accurate oil recovery forecasting capabilities while LSSVM shows the best performance for complex GOR behavior. Furthermore,\nall surrogate models are shown to serve as reliable proxy reservoir models useful for fast fluid recovery\nforecasts and sensitivity analyses.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "PALASH PANJA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Surrogate models, LSSVM ANN, Oil recovery, Artificial intelligence, Unconventional reservoirs", "Sumber": "Petroleum 4 (2018) 75-89 - KeAi, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2017.11.003", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "16 Jan 2019"}
