{"Nomor": 37789, "Judul": "Free-Surface Variational Principle for an Incompressible Fluid with Odd Viscosity", "Abstrak": "We present variational and Hamiltonian formulations of incompressible fluid dynamics with a free\nsurface and nonvanishing odd viscosity. We show that within the variational principle the odd viscosity\ncontribution corresponds to geometric boundary terms. These boundary terms modify Zakharov\u2019s Poisson\nbrackets and lead to a new type of boundary dynamics. The modified boundary conditions have a natural\ngeometric interpretation describing an additional pressure at the free surface proportional to the angular\nvelocity of the surface itself. These boundary conditions are believed to be universal since the proposed\nhydrodynamic action is fully determined by the symmetries of the system.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Alexander G.
