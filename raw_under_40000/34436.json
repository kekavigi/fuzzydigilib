Using visually supported collaboration technology in an interior design studio", "Abstrak": "With the recognition of the importance of collaboration in a design studio and\nthe  advancement  of  technology,  increasing  numbers  of  design  students  collaborate  with\nothers in a technology-mediated learning environment (TMLE); however, not all students\nhave positive experiences in TMLEs. One possible reason for unsatisfactory collaboration\nexperiences is that existing text-oriented collaboration technology may not fully support\ninterior design students\u2019 needs for spontaneous interaction with visual images. The purpose\nof  the  current  research  was  to  determine  whether  a  visually  supported  collaboration\ntechnology  (VSCT)  for  designers,  enhances  students\u2019  collaboration  experiences  in  a\nTMLE. A total of 28 junior interior design students participated in the study, all of whom\nengaged in similar group projects via two collaboration modalities: face-to-face and VSCT.\nThe results show that collaboration modalities influence students\u2019 learning experiences, in\nparticular,  achievement  and  confidence  in  completing  collaborative  tasks.  When  using\nVSCT, students achieved significantly higher grade and demonstrated higher confidence in\ncompleting  collaborative  tasks  compared  to  face-to-face  collaboration;  however,  no  sig-\nnificant differences were reported in either their perception of the collaboration process or\ntheir evaluation of the medium in the two collaboration modalities. The findings demonstrate that VSCT enhanced students\u2019 collaboration experiences in design studio. Discussion and implications are provided to facilitate design students\u2019 positive collaboration experiences in a TMLE.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ji Young Cho  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Moon-Heum Cho and Nadya Kozinets"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Collaboration, Design communication, Design process,Technology mediation", "Sumber": "International Journal of Technology & Design Education.
