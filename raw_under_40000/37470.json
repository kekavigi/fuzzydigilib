{"Nomor": 37470, "Judul": "Applicable Superamphiphobic Ni/Cu Surface with High LiquidRepellency Enabled by the Electrochemical-Deposited Dual-ScaleStructure", "Abstrak": "Until now, scalable fabrication and utilizationof superamphiphobic surfaces based on sophisticatedstructures has remained challenging. Herein, we develop anapplicable superamphiphobic surface with nano-Ni pyramid/micro-Cu cone structures prepared by cost-effective electro-chemical deposition. More importantly, excellent dynamicwettability is achieved, exhibiting as ultralow sliding angle(?0\u00b0), multiple droplets rebounding (13 times), and a totalrejection. The supportive cushions trapped within the dual-scale micro/nanostructures is proved to be the key factorcontributing to such high liquid repellency, whose existence isintuitively ascertained at both solid?air?liquid and water?solid?oil systems in this work. In addition, the enduring reliability ofthe wetting performance under various harsh conditions further endows the surface with broader application prospects.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Tanyanyu_Wang_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164527"}, "Penulis": "Tanyanyu Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Junyan Cai, Yunwen WuTao Hang,  Anmin Hu, Huiqin Ling,Ming Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "superamphiphobic surface, electrochemical deposition, liquid repellency, droplet rebounds and rejection,dual-scale structure, applicable Ni/Cu surface", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
