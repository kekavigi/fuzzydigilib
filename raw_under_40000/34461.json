While the formation of acid dissolved wormhole is derived from heterogeneous\nphysical and chemical transportations and reactions. Alveolate dissolved pores, krast caves, and\nnatural fissures are the major reservoir spaces for the Sinian dolomite formation in the Anyue gas\nfield of the Sichuan Basin. There were four categories of formation, which are matrix dominated,\ninter-breccia dissolved pore dominated, dissolved pore and cave dominated, and fissure and cave\ndominated, based on the development intensity and connectedness of caves and fissures. The caves\nand fissures make the wormhole formation and propagation particularly complicated. Firstly, the 3-\nD topological structure of dissolved pores, vugs, fissures and throats inside cores is quantitatively\nscanned by CT imaging technology for its feature of vivid and damage-free. Secondly, 3-D patterns\nof wormhole are obtained with CT scanning after core flooding by acid. Additionally, the porethroat network model is reconstructed with digital cores technology. Then, the size and ratio of\npore and throat before and after core flooding by acid is analyzed and the absolute permeability of\npore scale flow is numerically simulated to understand the fundamental influence of pores and\nvugs distribution and connectedness on wormhole propagation. Lastly, the wormhole pattern\ngained by CT scanning and simulating with two-scale model is compared. Meanwhile, the corrected\ntwo-scale model is utilized to simulate the wormhole propagation for matrix acidizing and acid\nfracturing of Sinian fractured-vuggy dolomite in Anyue gas field, Sichuan Basin. The optimized\ninjection rate and volume were in agreement with the characteristic matrix acidizing operating\ncurve, which indicates that the two-scale model was suitable for matrix acidizing optimization\ndesign of such formations. In addition, the simulated acid etched fracture length with considering\nthe dynamic wormhole leakoff was consistent with the well testing interpreted result.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "FEI LIU  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yu Sang", "Nanxing Xie", "Li Li", "Li Ran", "Weihua Chen"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "CT scanning, Digital core, Dolomite, Wormhole, Fractured-vuggy reservoir, Matrix acidizing, Acid fracturing", "Sumber": "Petroleum - KeAi, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2017.05.007", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Feb 2019"}
