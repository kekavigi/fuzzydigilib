Hobbes offers the myth of the uncivilized human in the dystopian state  of  nature  who  needs  governance  in  order  to  counter  his  or  her  own  self-destructive  tendencies.  This  myth  informs  the  classic  management  theories  of Taylor  and  Mayo.  Rousseau  proposes  a  counter-myth  that  envisions  the  noble savage  in  the  utopian  state  of  nature,  who  becomes  morally  corrupted  by  being socialized  into  the  institutions  of  modern  society.  This  myth  is  echoed  in  post-bureaucratic  management  literature.  Comparing  Rousseau\u2019s  romanticization  of nature  with  what  I  call  the  romanticization  of  markets,  \nI  show  how  the  post-bureaucratic  management  literature  employs  the  logic  of  market  rationalism  togenerate a managerial pedagogy  that  installs   the   market   as   the   control mechanism for regulating the internal relations of the organization", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Christian Garmann Johnsen [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "market rationalism; post-bureaucracy; mythology; Rousseau; Hobbes", "Sumber": "Culture and Organization Vol. 22, No. 1, 88 \u2013 105, 2016", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Apr 2019"}
