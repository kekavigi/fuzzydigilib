An approach that offers solutions to these challenges  is  emulating  nature\u2019s  patterns  and  strategies.  There  are  many  elements  of  sustainability  employed by nature that can be adopted for aquaculture systems  through  necessary  adjustments  (or  adapta-tions). Analysis of empirical data generated by a series of   experiments   on   different   aquaculture   systems      generated new knowledge of practical importance. An outcome  of  the  analysis  pertaining  to  two  important  aspects   of   aquaculture,   the   sex   control   in  captive   \nstocks  of  commercially  important  protogynous  hermaphrodite  grouper  and  the  operation  of  integrated  multi-trophic  aquaculture  systems  is  presented  here.  Both cases serve as outstanding examples of the relevance  of  examining  and  applying  nature\u2019s  principles  for  finding  sustainable  solutions  to  aquaculture  pro-blems.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Saleem Mustafa [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Abentin Estim"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Aquaculture,    nature\u2019s    design,    systems         approach, sustainability", "Sumber": "CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 115, NO. 6, 25 SEPTEMBER 2018", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Mei 2019"}
