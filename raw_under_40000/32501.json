{"Nomor": 32501, "Judul": "School performance, social networking effects, and learning of school children: Evidence of reciprocal relationships in Abu Dhabi", "Abstrak": "This study uses structural equations modeling to test a hypothetical social network model\nwith applications to a sample of 34,896 school children in Abu Dhabi. The main independent\nconstructs in the model are related to children\u2019s attitude with regard to social networking,\nreasons for using social networks, things done on social networks, and topics\nused. The dependent constructs cover perceived school performance and social effects of\nsocial networking. The study will describe the relations among the various constructs.\nThe effect of other variables, such as parental knowhow, is also investigated. Our work\nhas improved our insight in the social networking model. Results support the idea of reciprocal\nrelations among perceived performance, learning from social networking, and the\neffect of social networking. Evidence for a model that includes opposite pathways implies\nthat the problem of social networking constructs, its antecedents, and possible consequences\nshould be examined with caution", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Masood Badri [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yang Guang b", "Asma Al Rashedi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Social networking School performance Learning Abu Dhabi", "Sumber": "Telematics and Informatics", "Staf Input/Edit": "tuti yulia", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
