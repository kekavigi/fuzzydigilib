{"Nomor": 33059, "Judul": "Imaging subsurface northern Rahat Volcanic Field, Madinah city, Saudi Arabia, using Magnetotelluric study", "Abstrak": "Rahat volcanic field is one of the basaltic fields in Saudi Arabia that has threemajor geohazard events; the historical\neruption (1256 CE), the fissure eruption (~4500\u20131500 BP), and seismic swarm (1999). These events were\nstudied and evaluated using geophysical and geochemical studies as well as volcanological studies. Geophysical\nstudies include gravity, seismic, and magnetotelluric surveys. In the current research, the magnetotelluric data\nwill be analyzed using 3D inversion technique in order to image the subsurface resistivity setting of the study\narea.\nResults from3D inversion of theMT data revealed fourmajor resistivity structures. The first is a layer of intermediate\nresistivity (40\u2013250?-meters)which is thicker (~800m) to the south-west and thinner to the eastern edge,\nmostly covered by exposed Precambrian basement. This layer is underlain by resistive (N1000?-metres) granitic\nbasement. Intruding into the resistive basement are two near-vertical conductive (b20?-metres) structures.One\nis located immediately west of the historic eruption (1256 CE) centre in the north, at a depth of about 15 km. The\nother intrusive is on the southern end of the survey area, also at a depth of about 15 km. Two conductive \u201cchannels\u201d\ntrending NW-SE and NE-SWwere observed at depths of about 18 km. The NE-SWaligned \u201cchannel\u201d runs\nthrough the northern intrusivewhile theNW-SE trending \u201cchannel\u201d runs in themiddle of the study area and connects\nboth intrusive. The conductive intrusive and \u201cchannels\u201d may be attribute partial melts stored in the preexisting\nstructures within the lower crust. Although the youngest known trachytic eruptions from the study\narea are several hundred thousand years old, recent and ongoing seismicity strongly suggest there may bemagmatic\nactivities in the lower and probably upper crust.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Essam Aboud  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Peter Wamey, Faisal Alqahtani, M.R.Moufti"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Magnetotelluric Volcanic field Harrat Rahat 3D Imaging trachytic volcanism", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 159 (2018) 564\u2013572, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.10.005", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Jan 2019"}
