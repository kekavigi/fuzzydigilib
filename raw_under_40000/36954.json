The influence of the reaction temperature has beeninvestigated by performing the synthesis at four differenttemperatures (Ppy@Fe2O3-120\u00b0C, Ppy@Fe2O3-140\u00b0C,Ppy@Fe2O3-160\u00b0C, and Ppy@Fe2O3-180\u00b0C). Synthesizedmaterials exhibited an unprecedentedly peculiar morphology(star/coral reef-like architectures), induced by the presence ofpyrrole in the reaction media. Full characterization of thesamples revealed the critical influence of temperature on thecrystallinity, textural properties and specially on (C+N)/Fesurface ratios in the materials. As-synthesized nanohybridswere integrated into electrodes to construct supercapacitor devices. A effective tuning of the electrochemical features wasachieved by controlling the (C+N)/Fe ratio on the surface, strongly dependent on reaction temperature. The bestelectrochemical performance was reached by Ppy@Fe2O3-180\u00b0C nanohybrid, which exhibited a remarkable capacitance valueof 560 F g?1at a current density of 5 A g?1and an outstanding cycling stability of ca. 97.3% after 20 000 cycles of charge?discharge at 40A g?1was reached", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Chunping_Xu_2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/163302"}, "Penulis": "Chunping Xu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Alain R.
