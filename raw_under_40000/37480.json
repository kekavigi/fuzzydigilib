{"Nomor": 37480, "Judul": "Urban birds and planting design: strategies for incorporating ecological goals into residential landscapes", "Abstrak": "Private residential property occupies a major part of the urban land base, yet\nconsiderable potential remains for improving the ecological performance of private gardens\nand landscapes. Ecologically-oriented approaches to design of residential properties, however,\nare only valuable if they are compatible with private landowner interests and needs\u2013otherwise\nthey may never be implemented. Landscape designers would benefit from more comprehensive\nguidance for ecologically-oriented planting design that best fits within residential settings.\nThis paper identifies plant-based design strategies that may improve avian species richness,\nreviews scientific literature supporting these options, and describes three years of structured\ndesign research to evaluate how these strategies can be compatible with the programmatic and\naesthetic goals of residential landowners. We worked with three New York State communities\nbeginning with a community/neighborhood-scale visioning and goal setting process and\nending with parcel-scale landscape designs. The project, in total, developed residential landscape\ndesigns for 50 private properties, each incorporating urban ecological benefits in\ncombination with the interests and needs of the owner. We share here a set of planting design\nstrategies for enhancing avian habitat on residential private property generated during this\nprocess. They include planting strategies that: a) contribute to landscape networks; b) build\nvegetative structure at sites; c) provide microrefugia; d) optimize forage resource availability;\nand e) enhance plant diversity. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of design results for the\nstrategies is discussed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Joshua F.
