But these cosmic mileposts may not be so uniform. A study now finds evidence that the supernovae can arise by two different processes, adding to lingering suspicions that standard candles aren\u2019t so standard after all.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SHANNON HALL [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Astronomi", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Astrofisika", "Sumber": "380 | NATURE | VOL 548 | 24 AUGUST 2017", "Staf Input/Edit": "pustaka bosscha", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "16 Jan 2019"}
