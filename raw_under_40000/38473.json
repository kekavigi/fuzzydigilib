{"Nomor": 38473, "Judul": "Role of Hydrogen Bonds in Thermal Transport across Hard/Soft Material Interfaces", "Abstrak": "The nature of the bond is a dominant factor in determining the thermal\ntransport across interfaces. In this paper, we study the role of the hydrogen bond in\nthermal transport across interfaces between hard and soft materials with different\nsurface functionalizations around room temperature using molecular dynamics\nsimulations. Gold (Au) is studied as the hard material, and four different types of\norganic liquids with different polarizations, including hexane (C5H11CH3), hexanamine (C6H13NH2), hexanol (C6H13OH), and hexanoic acid (C5H11COOH), are\nused to represent the soft materials. To study the hydrogen bonds at the Au/organic\nliquid interface, three types of thiol-terminated self-assembled monolayer (SAM)\nmolecules, including 1-hexanethiol [HS(CH2)5CH3], 6-mercapto-1-hexanol [HS-\n(CH2)6OH], and 6-mercaptohexanoic acid [HS(CH2)5COOH], are used to\nfunctionalize the Au surface. These SAM molecules form hydrogen bonds with the\nstudied organic liquids with varying strengths, which are found to significantly improve\nefficient interfacial thermal transport. Detailed analyses on the molecular-level details\nreveal that such efficient thermal transport originates from the collaborative effects of the electrostatic and van der Waals portions\nin the hydrogen bonds. It is found that stronger hydrogen bonds will pull the organic molecules closer to the interface. This\nshorter intermolecular distance leads to increased interatomic forces across the interfaces, which result in larger interfacial heat\nflux and thus higher thermal conductance. These results can provide important insight into the design of hard/soft materials or\nstructures for a wide range of applications", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Teng Zhang 1.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/169761"}, "Penulis": "Teng Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ashley R.
