{"Nomor": 38278, "Judul": "Stakeholders\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd perception of residential density: a case study of Adelaide, Australia", "Abstrak": "Residential density\u2019 is a frequently used concept often applied in planning practice. The notion of density policy is well understood; however, it is perceived, and by extension applied, differently across the world. Despite the increased focus and awareness of housing density, there appears to be little coherence or consensus within the planning and development sector, political circles and the general community about what it is, how it should be applied, and whether or not it is a positive or negative feature. Therefore, the\naim of this paper is to identify stakeholders\u2019 understanding of density. In order to achieve this, a case study approach was adopted in order to know the various stakeholders\u2019 awareness and comprehension of density, and to that end, Adelaide, the capital city of South Australia, was selected as a case study city for this purpose. The research demonstrated that the stakeholders\u2019 perception of density is strongly influenced by the built form of residential areas (for example, public image) rather than that of measurement or scale,\neven though there is no direct relationship between built form and density.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Alpana Sivam [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["\u2022 Sadasivam Karuppannan \u2022 Michael C.
