{"Nomor": 32911, "Judul": "Environment tracking and signal following in a reinforcer-ratio reversal procedure", "Abstrak": "Several studies suggest that the degree of control by reinforcer ratios (environment tracking) and by exteroceptive stimuli that signal future reinforcer availability (signal following) depends on environmental certainty: As reinforcers become more likely at one location, environmental contingencies exert stronger control\nand exteroceptive stimuli exert weaker control. This research has not yet been extended to environments in\nwhich reinforcer availability changes across time, even though such changes are present in most natural environments. Thus, in the present experiment, we examined environment tracking and signal following in a\nconcurrent schedule in which the reinforcer ratio reversed to its reciprocal 30 s after a reinforcer delivery and\nkeylight-color stimuli signaled the likely or definite time or location of the next reinforcer. Across conditions, we\nmanipulated environmental certainty by varying the probability of reinforcer deliveries on the locally richer key.\nThis made the location of future reinforcers at a particular time more or less certain, but did not change the\noverall reinforcer ratio. Changes in local environmental certainty had little to no effect on environment tracking\nand signal following; in all conditions, keylight-color stimuli strongly controlled choice and reinforcer ratios\nexerted weak control. The present findings suggest that the extent of environment tracking and signal following\nis primarily determined by global, not local, environmental certainty.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Stephanie Gomes-Ng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Douglas Elliffe., Sarah Cowie"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Environment tracking Signal following Local reinforcer contingencies Stimulus control Pigeon", "Sumber": "Behavioural Processes 157 (2018) 208\u2013224", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Jan 2019"}
