{"Nomor": 35438, "Judul": "Bandwidth Limitation of Directly Contacted Graphene?Silicon Optoelectronics", "Abstrak": "Electrically contacting layered materials on a\ncomplementary metal-oxide-semiconductor transistor (CMOS)-\nprocessed lateral silicon homojunction offers a new platform\nenabling postfabrication-free high-speed hybrid optoelectronic\ndevices on chip. Understanding detailed junction formation and\nradiofrequency (RF) response on the multicomponent interface\nbetween directly contacted silicon nanophotonic devices and lowbandgap\nmaterials is essential for predicting the performance of\nthose active components. Electrostatic carrier distribution as well\nas the dynamics of externally injected carriers are strongly\ninfluenced by spatially varying Schottky barriers on the vertical\nheterojunctions....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Dun Mao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Thomas Kananen, Tiantian Li, Anishkumar Soman, Jeffrey Sinsky, Nicholas Petrone, James Hone, Po Dong, Tingyi Gu*,\u2020"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "graphene, RC constant limit, small-signal model, p-i-n junction, heterojunction", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Feb 2019"}
