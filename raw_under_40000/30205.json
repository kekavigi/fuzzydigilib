{"Nomor": 30205, "Judul": "COASTAL WAVE MAPPING USING NUMERICAL MODELLING METHOD AT JAKARTA BAY BEFORE AND AFTER JAKARTA GIANT SEA WALL CONSTRUCTION", "Abstrak": "Jakarta is the capital and largest city of Indonesia, located on the northwest coast of   \n\nJava. Supported by its geography, Jakarta has a large and modern port in North Jakarta, which contribute huge advantages for Indonesia's economic. Unfortunately,   \n\nJakarta has some serious natural hazard such as flooding caused by the seawater run off as a result of high rate of land subsidence in North Jakarta. To prevent the flood, Jakarta Giant Sea Wall (JGSW) construction designed to protect the city is chosen as a long-term action, but also lead to another environmental impact. This study focuses to understand the impact of the JGSW construction to the wave condition at Jakarta Bay by using wave model derived based on numerical function.   \n\nThe wave numerical modelling in this study done by using SWAN (Simulating Wave Nearshore). Data required in this model process are bathymetry, coastline, and wind data at Jakarta Bay. Wave model simulation conducted for northwest monsoon season, southeast monsoon season, and extreme weather condition for both cases, before and after JGSW construction. The results of wave model are significant wave height value and wave direction, presented by graphics and maps. From the simulation results, there are differences in the significant wave height value and wave direction before and after JGSW construction, depends on space and time. The highest difference occurred on northwest monsoon season, where inside the sea wall area the significant wave height value is decreasing by 48.9%, while along the sea wall area is increasing by 27.6% and at the offshore area is increasing by 12.98%. The most noticeable difference in wave direction occurred in the area inside of the sea wall on northwest monsoon season.", "Daftar File": {"2015 TA PP RANDU KALIFA SYA\u2019BANA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/138209", "2015 TA PP RANDU KALIFA SYA\u2019BANA 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/138210", "2015 TA PP RANDU KALIFA SYA\u2019BANA 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/138211", "2015 TA PP RANDU KALIFA SYA\u2019BANA 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/138212", "2015 TA PP RANDU KALIFA SYA\u2019BANA 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/138213", "2015 TA PP RANDU KALIFA SYA\u2019BANA 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/138214"}, "Penulis": "RANDU KALIFA SYA'BANA (nim : 15111093)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. rer. nat.
