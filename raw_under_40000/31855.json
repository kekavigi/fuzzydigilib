This alternative energy sources called unconventional energy. Coalbed methane has been developed since 1980 is one of unconventional energy which has dual porosity system which are micropores and macropores. During the coalification process, large quantities of methane are generated and stored within the coal on its matrix. Coalbed methane reservoir production is not the same as conventional reservoir, gas in matrix and micropores will only release by desorption process that can occur by reducing the reservoir pressure or called as dewatering time.   \n \n \n\nDewatering time is also defined as a period when the well only produce water without gas. This dewatering time is becomes the main concern to develop coalbed methane reservoir due to its high investment needed for this process. This study focuses on analyzing correlation between dewatering time period and parameters including (Langmuir Volume Constant, Langmuir Pressure Constant, bottom hole pressure, initial reservoir pressure, fracture porosity fracture permeability, well spacing, reservoir thickness, desorption pressure, coal density, water viscosity, and water density) for multiple vertical wells development. Sensitivity analysis for each parameter to dewatering time period is performed and a predictive model to estimate dewatering is developed.", "Daftar File": {"2015 TA PP YUSUF ALFYAN PRADITYA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/142498"}, "Penulis": "YUSUF ALFYAN PRADITYA (NIM : 12211042)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Prof. Ir.
