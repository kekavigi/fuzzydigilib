{"Nomor": 37539, "Judul": "Strainburst phenomena and numerical simulation of self-initiated brittle rock failure", "Abstrak": "This paper focuses on \u2018self-initiated\u2019 strainbursts, and starts by providing an overview of these phenomena and\ntheir relevance to mining. This is used to set the framework for the numerical simulations presented in the\nsecond part of the paper. The numerical simulations examine and address challenges in modelling strainbursts\nrelated to the inherent difficulties in dynamic failure simulation. Existing methods either simulate dynamic\nfailure under static or pseudo-static conditions while adopting some threshold factor (normally in terms of stress,\nstrain, or energy) as an indicator of rockburst potential, or incorporate an assumed dynamic disturbance to cause\nrockburst damage. A distinct-element bonded block method is presented to simulate strainbursts. Instead of\ntriggering failure by an assumed dynamic disturbance, the adopted method simulates the generation of a seismic\nevent by self-initiated rock mass fracturing. This simulation of a self-initiated strainburst is interpreted using\npatterns of cracking, displacement and strain fields, ground velocities, and calculated kinetic and dissipated slip\nenergies. The mechanisms of self-initiated strainbursting are successfully captured by the distinct-element\nbonded block method.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_FUQIANG_GAO_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164913"}, "Penulis": "Fuqiang Gao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Peter K.
