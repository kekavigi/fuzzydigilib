{"Nomor": 37655, "Judul": "PPM versus PCM for optical local-area networks", "Abstrak": "Pulse-position modulation (PPM) is\npresented within the context of a local-area\nnetwork (LAN) application. A simplified analysis\nis used to calculate the advantage of converting\nfrom pulse-code modulation (PCM) to PPM signalling\nin a LAN, assuming in each case the same\nfibre network and the same optical transmitting\ndevice. Although PPM exploits its wide bandwidth\nto give greater sensitivity in noise, the true\nsystem advantage is obtainable only by using a\nlarge peak-to-mean-power ratio in the transmitter.\nIt is shown that this performance is possible for\nboth a laser diode and for an edge-emitting LED.\nAn experimental system is reported, operating at a\ndata rate of 4 Mbit/s, and good correspondence\nwith theory is obtained. Design procedures are\ngiven for broad classes of situation.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "J.D. Martin  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["H.H.
