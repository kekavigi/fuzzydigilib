{"Nomor": 33164, "Judul": "Rock mechanical modelling of the Bentonite Rock Interaction Experiment, \ufffd\ufffdsp\ufffd\ufffd Hard Rock Laboratory, Sweden", "Abstrak": "The Bentonite Rock Interaction Experiment (BRIE) was performed in a tunnel at a depth of 420 m at the \u00c4sp\u00f6\nHard Rock Laboratory in Sweden. The experiment focused on the hydraulic properties of rock and bentonite\naiming at investigating the exchange of water across a bentonite-rock interface. The hypothesis for the mechanical modelling presented here was that changes in flow (observed in rock and on bentonite parcels) were\ndue to local mechanical deformation. Induced stresses related to the construction (and experimental) stages for\nthe BRIE site such as excavation of tunnels, drilling and over-coring of two vertical, tunnel-floor boreholes and,\nfinally, installation and swelling of bentonite, were expected to be the main causes of these deformations. We\nassumed that this could be investigated using a step-wise rock mechanical modelling approach (with a relevant\nmodelling sequence) and validated by using a transdisciplinary approach including field structural geological\nmapping (geometric, kinematic and dynamic interpretation of the exposed fracture sets) and hydrogeological\ninvestigations.\nFor key fractures intersecting the boreholes, the modelled fracture normal and shear displacements were\nfound to be local, small, and in line with field observations and measurements for BRIE. Results point at an\nagreement between the spatial locations of changes in flow identified from the bentonite parcels and the locations of inelastic deformation indicated by mechanical modelling for a reverse stress regime. Besides providing\ninformation about the key fractures, the structural mapping allowed to establish solid relationships between\nbrittle structural features in the tunnel and in the cores, which were used as, or compared to, the main fracture\ninput to the rock mechanical modelling. The identified fracture sets were found to be structurally reconcilable\nwith the larger-scale tectonic picture of the area.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Asa Fransson [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Margareta Lonnqvist and Giulio Viola"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Rock mechanical modelling, Construction stages, Induced stresses, Structural geological mapping, Hydrogeological observations, BRIE", "Sumber": "International Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences 113 (2019) 255\u2013267", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani \u00a0\n                                     Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "16 Jan 2019"}
