{"Nomor": 38609, "Judul": "Mapping the Surface Adsorption Forces of Nanomaterials in Biological Systems", "Abstrak": "The biological surface adsorption index (BSAI) is a novel approach to characterize surface\nadsorption energy of nanomaterials that is the primary force behind nanoparticle aggregation,\nprotein corona formation, and other complex interactions of nanomaterials within biological\nsystems. Five quantitative nanodescriptors were obtained to represent the surface adsorption\nforces (hydrophobicity, hydrogen bond, polarity/polarizability, and lone-pair electrons) of the\nnanomaterial interaction with biological components. We have mapped the surface adsorption\nforces over 16 different nanomaterials. When the five-dimensional information of the\nnanodescriptors was reduced to two dimensions, the 16 nanomaterials were classified into\ndistinct clusters according their surface adsorption properties. BSAI nanodescriptors are\nintrinsic properties of nanomaterials useful for quantitative structureactivity relationship\n(QSAR) model development. This is the first success in quantitative characterization of the\nsurface adsorption forces of nanomaterials in biological conditions, which could open a\nquantitative avenue in predictive nanomedicine development, risk assessment, and safety\nevaluation of nanomaterials.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Xin R.
