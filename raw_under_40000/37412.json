{"Nomor": 37412, "Judul": "Interaction spectroscopy of a two-component Mott insulator", "Abstrak": "We prepare and study a two-component Mott insulator of bosonic atoms with two particles per site. The\nmapping of this system to a magnetic spin model and the subsequent study of its quantum phases require a detailed knowledge of the interaction strengths of the two components. In this work we use radio-frequency transitions and an on-site interaction blockade for precise empirical determination of the interaction strengths of different combinations of hyperfine states on a single lattice site. We create a map of the interactions of the two lowest hyperfine states of 7Li as a function of magnetic field, including measurements of several Feshbach resonances with exceptional sensitivity, and we identify promising regions for the realization of magnetic spin models.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jesse Amato-Grill [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Niklas Jepsen,", "Ivana Dimitrova,", "William Lunden,", "and Wolfgang Ketterle"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW A99, 033612 (2019); \u00a92019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari \u00a0\n                                     Ratnasari", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Mar 2019"}
