{"Nomor": 37505, "Judul": "Sustainability  through Art", "Abstrak": "One of the most prominent urban problems European cities face, is not only the physical degradation of its historic city centers, but  also  the  degradation  of  their  social,  economic  and  environmental  \ncontext.  Moreover,  common  rehabilitation  methods  and  strategies  are  often  unsuccessful  combatting  such  problem,  and  new  ways  and  strategies  must  be  researched,  tested,  and  \nimplemented under a new sustainable development policy. Creativity  and  artistic  activities  can  play  an  important  role  in  the  resolution  of  this  problem.  For  example,  the  re-occupation  of  derelict buildings, through creative and innovative activities, can contribute to resolving the primary issue.\nWhile analyzing a comparative case study using three examples: LxFactory in Lisbon, Ateneu Popular 9 Barris in Barcelona, and 59  Rivoli  in  Paris,  it ?s  possible  to  conclude that  their  rehabilitation  through  art  and  culture,  could  produce  positive  side  effects  leading to social renovation and solid economic activity within itself and its surrounding area, creating new local economies, jobs, new tourists attractions, real estate opportunities and more.\nConsidering the current  standpoint  and  outlook  on  rehabilitation,  as  an  action  and  movement  of  sustainability,  especially  at  the  environmental level, and associating it with the arts and culture movement, will allow it to solve the social and economic problem simultaneously.  \nBy introducing new dynamic living spaces in unoccupied and derelict buildings also re-energizes the economic value of the building as well as, most importantly, regenerating the actual city.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ana  Cruz Lopes  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jo\u00e3o Farinha", "Miguel Amado"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Urban Environment; Rehabilitation; Sustainable Development; Art; Social Development", "Sumber": "Science Direct Energy Procedia 119 (2017)  752\u2013766", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Mar 2019"}
