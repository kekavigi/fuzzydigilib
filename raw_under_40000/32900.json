{"Nomor": 32900, "Judul": "Angle-stack reverse time migration in VTI media", "Abstrak": "Seismic anisotropy is widespread in real media, the conventional isotropic reverse time migration method will\nlead to problems such as inaccurate depth and unfocused energy in dealing with the anisotropic issues, and\nlowfrequency noisewith strong amplitude in imaging results can not be completely removed by simple filtering\nmethod such as Laplace filter operator. To solve these problems,we have researched pseudo acoustic equation to\nsimulate qPwave propagation in anisotropic VTImedia and used the smoothed isotropy or elliptic anisotropy tapered\ncircular region located in source points to suppress the qSV wave. On this basis, we also develop anglestack\nreverse time migrationmethod in VTI media, which stacks the imaging results in angle domain to suppress\nlow-frequency noise and improve imaging accuracy.Model test and application example prove that thismethod\ncan obtain accurate imaging results with balanced energy in steep dip structures, and has better effect in suppressing\nlow-frequency imaging noise.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ning Qin [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Reverse time migration Angle-stack VTI media Poynting vector Low frequency noise", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 159 (2018) 506\u2013510, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.09.027", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Jan 2019"}
