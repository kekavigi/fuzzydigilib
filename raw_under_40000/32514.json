Furthermore, measures of student experience\nof e-learning emerged but were not repeatedly used with diverse populations. A psychometric\napproach with five phases was used to develop and test a new self-report measure of skills and experience\nwith information and communication technology and attitudes to computers in education. Phase 1:\nLiterature review and identification of key items. Phase 2: Development and refinement of items with\nexpert panel (n = 16) and students (n = 3) to establish face and content validity. Phase 3: Pilot testing\nof draft instrument with graduate pre-registration nursing students (n = 60) to assess administration procedures\nand acceptability of the instrument. Phase 4: Test\u2013retest with further sample of graduate preregistration\nnursing students (n = 70) tested stability and internal consistency. Phase 5: Main study with\npre-registration nursing students (n = 458), further testing of internal consistency. The instrument proved\nto have moderate test\u2013retest stability and the sub-scales had acceptable internal consistency. When used\nwith a larger, more diverse population the psychometric properties were more variable. Further work is\nneeded to refine the instrument with specific reference to possible cultural and linguistic response patterns\nand technological advances.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ann Wilkinson [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Julia Roberts", "Alison E.
