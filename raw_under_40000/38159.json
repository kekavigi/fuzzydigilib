{"Nomor": 38159, "Judul": "ADOPTION OF INSTITUTIONAL OPTIONS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION: COLLECTIVE ACTION PROBLEMS AND OPTION CHOICE", "Abstrak": "This study investigates the factors that influence the choice of options\nfor affordable housing production. It also demonstrates the utility of the\nInstitutional Collective Action (IAC) framework by identifying how it can\nbe applied to the choice of options for affordable housing production. The\nfindings of this study show that the option chosen by a local government for\naffordable housing production depends on property value of affordable\nhousing and the capacity of local government, rather than local\ngovernment\u2019s social responsibility and the community\u2019s economic\ncondition. This study also demonstrates that transaction costs incurred due\nto land regulations can substantially influence the adoption of options for\naffordable housing production. Finally, one of the important findings is that\nnetworks between regional cooperative agencies and local governments can\npromote a rehabilitation option for affordable housing production. This\nresult suggests that local governments need to actively take advantage of\ncoordination with regional agencies to successfully promote affordable\nhousing production.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "HYUNSANG HA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["IN WON LEE"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "affordable housing, direct construction, rehabilitation", "Sumber": "https://search.proquest.com/docview/920572911/fulltextPDF/3009DFD7E79F4A4BPQ/1?accountid=31562", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Mei 2019"}
