{"Nomor": 32969, "Judul": "Study On Characteristics Of Well-Test Type Curves For Composite Reservoir With Sealing Faults", "Abstrak": "The pressure response for the composite reservoirs with a sealing fault locating in inner and outer region\nis different, which neglected by previous researchers, would cause significant errors during well-test\ninterpretations. Based on seepage theory, a well-test model of two-region radial composite reservoir\nwith infinite outer boundary has been built in this study considering wellbore storage and skin effects.\nThe solutions for this model and characteristics of the type curves have been analyzed by applying the\nmethod of mirror image, Laplace transformation and superposition principle, including a straight fault, a\nperpendicular fault and parallel faults cases. The study shows that the dimensionless pressure derivative\ncurves would be obviously different in two cases: the well to fault distance is larger, and smaller than the\nhalf length of the inner-region radius. Therefore, type curves are presented with reasonable parameters\nto analyze the distance effect on the dynamic pressure response. The results in this study are of great\nsignificance for guiding the oil and gas composite reservoirs' production and optimizing the hydrocarbon\nrecovery", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "QIGUO LIU [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Heng Lu, Longxin Li, Aiting Mu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Composite reservoir, Sealing faults, Well-test interpretation, Dynamic pressure response, Superposition principle", "Sumber": "Petroleum 4 (2018) 309-317 - KeAi, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.03.011", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Jan 2019"}
