{"Nomor": 34427, "Judul": "Why does research in finance have so little impact?", "Abstrak": "The quantity of finance research has grown enormously over the past two decades, yet\nquestions remain over its breadth and ability to benefit the economy and society beyond\nacademia. Using multisource data, we argue that individual and institutional incentives\nhave fostered insularity and a consequent homogeneity in the discipline. We examine\nthe characteristics of research that is published and cited in the leading field journals in\nfinance, arguing that the work has become abstract and unrelated to real world issues.\nThe work published in the \u2018top\u2019 journals makes increasing use of US data, even where\nthe researchers are drawn from different countries. Using information from impact assessment,\npublication patterns, and grant capture, we illustrate that this narrow agenda lacks\nrelevance to the financial services sector, the economy or wider society compared to other\nareas of business and management research. In particular, we highlight the relative\nabsence of research on ethics in academic finance and discuss the likely consequences\nfor the discipline including its relevance to society.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_CHRIS_BROOKS_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/156180"}, "Penulis": "Chris Brooks [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Evelyn Fenton, Lisa Schopohl, James Walker"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Teknik Informatika", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Teknik Elektro dan Informatika", "Subjek": "Financial economics", "Kata Kunci": "Critical finance, Journal ratings lists, Impact, Elitism in publishing, Incentive structures, Ethical finance research", "Sumber": "Critical Perspectives on Accounting 58 (2019) 24-52", "Staf Input/Edit": "Dwi Ary Fuziastuti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Feb 2019"}
