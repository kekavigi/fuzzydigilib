{"Nomor": 37663, "Judul": "Superresolution Microscopy of Cold Atoms in an Optical Lattice", "Abstrak": "Superresolution microscopy has revolutionized the fields of chemistry and biology by resolving features\nat the molecular level. In atomic physics, such a scheme can be applied to resolve the atomic density\ndistribution beyond the diffraction limit and to perform quantum control. Here we demonstrate superresolution imaging based on the nonlinear response of atoms to an optical pumping pulse. With this\ntechnique, the atomic density distribution can be imaged with a full-width-at-half-maximum resolution of\n32(4) nm and a localization precision below 500 pm. The short optical pumping pulse of 1.4 ?s enables us\nto resolve fast atomic dynamics within a single lattice site. A by-product of our scheme is the emergence of\nmoir\u00b4e patterns on the atomic cloud, which we show to be immensely magnified images of the atomic\ndensity in the lattice.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mickey McDonald [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jonathan Trisnadi,", "Kai-Xuan Yao,", "and Cheng Chin"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Physics", "Kata Kunci": "fisika atom dan molekul, optik, fisika kuantum", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW X 9, 021001 (2019); Published by the American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari \u00a0\n                                     Rd.
