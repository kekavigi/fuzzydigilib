{"Nomor": 35198, "Judul": "Water efficiency and wastewater reduction in an integrated woolen textile mill", "Abstrak": "The most important environmental issues caused by the textile industry are intensive water consumption,\nhigh amounts of wastewater generation with significant pollutant loads. Previous studies were\nfocused on minimization of water consumption and wastewater amounts in cotton textile finishingdyeing.\nThere are very few real-scale scientific studies about water efficiency in woolen textile production.\nIn this study, it was aimed to reduce water consumption, wastewater amount and its pollutant\nloads by appropriate techno-economical minimization techniques in an integrated woolen textile mill. In\nthis context, water consumptions and wastewater generations in basic and other auxiliary processes of\nthe mill were examined by detailed on-site investigations. Process based specific water consumption and\nwastewater values were calculated. Additionally, water and wastewater samples were collected at\ndifferent periods and analyzed. Specific pollutant loads of wastewater were also calculated. Thus, reuse\npotentials of the process wastewaters were evaluated. Moreover, saving and reduction potentials of the\nmill were determined by comparing with similar textile mills. Total of 82 minimization techniques were\nidentified and evaluated by using multi-criteria decision-making methods. As a result, it was decided to\nimplement 9 minimization techniques in the mill. Thus, reductions in water consumption by 41e69%,\nwastewater amounts by 48e75% and wastewater chemical loads by 28e63% can be achieved by the\nimplementation of the minimization techniques. Potential payback period was ranged between 24 and\n60 months. Employed methodology and findings of the study may be useful to similar textile mills,\nstakeholders and regulators. Presented results may also provide a road map to textile industry for cleaner\nproduction applications", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Emrah Ozturk [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Nazl?
