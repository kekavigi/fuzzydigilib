{"Nomor": 32428, "Judul": "Petroleum and Health Care: Evaluating and Managing Health Care\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds Vulnerability to Petroleum Supply Shifts", "Abstrak": "Petroleum is used widely in health care\u2014primarily as a transport fuel and\nfeedstock for pharmaceuticals, plastics, and medical supplies\u2014and few substitutes for it are available. This dependence theoretically makes health care\nvulnerable to petroleum supply shifts, but this vulnerability has not been\nempirically assessed. We quantify key aspects of petroleum use in health care\nand explore historical associations between petroleum supply shocks and health\ncare prices. These analyses confirm that petroleum products are intrinsic to\nmodern health care and that petroleum supply shifts can affect health care\nprices. In anticipation of future supply contractions lasting longer than previous\nshifts and potentially disrupting health care delivery, we propose an adaptive\nmanagement approach and outline its application to the example of emergency\nmedical services", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "JEREMY HESS, MD, MPH [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Daniel Bednarz, Phd, Ma", "Jaeyong Bae, Ma", "Jessica Pierce, Phd"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Petroleum, health", "Sumber": "American Journal of Public Health  (Am J Public Health. 2011;101:1568\u20131579. doi:10.2105/AJPH. 2011.300233)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
