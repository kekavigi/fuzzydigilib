Inthis study, hydroxyapatite (HA)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanofillers were incorporated into a shape memorypolyurethane (SMPU) to enhance its mechanical properties. Then the nanocomposite was further modified using arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid (RGD peptide) to improve its cellular adhesion toward promoting neotissue formation and integration withsurrounding bone tissue. The physical and biological properties in terms of their chemical structure, surface wettability,mechanical behaviors, shape memory performance, and cell adhesion were systematically investigated. The results demonstratedthat the multimodified SMPU/HA/rGO/RGD nanocomposite significantly enhanced mechanical properties (e.g.,?200%increase in Young\u2019s modulus and >300% enhancement in tensile strength compared with the unmodified SMPU), which mightbe attributed to the intercalated structure and metal affinity inside the nanocomposite. Adhesion of rabbit bone mesenchymalstem cells was clearly demonstrated on an RGD-immobilized SMPU nanocomposite surface. With an excellent shape memorybehavior (e.g., 97.3% of shapefixity ratio and 98.2% of shape recovery ratio), we envision that our SMPU/HA/rGO/RGDnanocomposite can be implanted into a bone defect with a minimally invasive surgery", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Yuanchi_Zhang_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/161619"}, "Penulis": "Yuanchi Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jinlian Hu,Xin Zhao,Ruiqi Xie,Tingwu Qin,Fenglong Ji"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "shape memory polyurethane nanocomposite, hydroxyapatite, reduced graphene oxide, arginyl-glycyl-aspartic,enhanced mechanical properties, boosted cell adhesion, minimally invasive bone repair", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
