{"Nomor": 34858, "Judul": "Rheology Of Diluted And Semi-Diluted Partially Hydrolyzed Polyacrylamide Solutions Under Shear: Experimental Studies", "Abstrak": "Rheological properties of hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) solutions were measured in oscillatory and flow shear. In oscillatory shear the storage and loss moduli increased as the concentrations\nof the solutions increased, but they decreased as salinity increased. The relaxation spectra were\nplotted using the Kontogiorgos method. As shown in the relaxation spectra, the number of density\nof segmental units increased at first and then the peaks shifted and split into several as the concentration increased. With salinity increasing, the number of motion units increase and the peaks\nof segmental units became broader. In flow shear tests, the curves of viscosity versus shear rate\nwere fitted by a power law equation. The result showed that the flow behavior index decreased\nwith increasing concentration, while it generally increased with increasing of salinity. Furthermore,\nthe first normal stress difference increased as the concentration was increased, while it decreased\nas the salinity was increased. The first normal stress differences measured by the rheometer were\ncompared with the first normal stress differences calculated by the Laun equation and the results\nshowed that Laun equation deviates the experimental results.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Rui Zhang  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xianru He", "Shuwei Cai", "Kun Liu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Polymer oil displacement agents, Hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM), Viscoelasticity, Rheology, First-normal stress", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 3, Issue 2, Pages 258-265 (Juni 2017)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Feb 2019"}
