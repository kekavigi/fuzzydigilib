{"Nomor": 37409, "Judul": "X-ray chimneys in the Galactic Centre", "Abstrak": "The centre of our Galaxy hosts a supermassive black hole that currently\nemits electromagnetic radiation extremely weakly, but could have been much\nmore active in the past. Observations of ?-raysn have revealed two huge structures known as Fermi bubbles located above and below the Galactic plane1. These bubbles are filled with highly energetic particles moving at close to the speed of light, which were released from the Galactic Centre a few million years ago. On page 347, Ponti et al. 2 report X-ray observations that reveal chimney-like structures connecting the region around the Galactic\nCentre to the Fermi bubbles", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MASHA CHERNYAKOVA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Astronomi", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "galactic centre", "Sumber": "318 | NATURE | VOL 567 | 21 MARCH 2019", "Staf Input/Edit": "pustaka bosscha", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Mar 2019"}
