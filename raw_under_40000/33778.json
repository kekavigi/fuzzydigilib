{"Nomor": 33778, "Judul": "GPR trace analysis for coastal depositional environments of southern Brazil", "Abstrak": "Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is increasingly used for subsurface detection of structures due to nondestructive\ncharacteristics. Use of the method for studies of coastal depositional environments is growing in southern Brazil.\nIn this paper, we propose an analysis of traces in the variation in signal amplitude, integrated with the degree of\ncompaction determined in the drill hole, for the characterization of depositional environments in regressive barriers. Signal attenuation with depth was interpreted from the least squares method for two cases of contrast in\nvolume of rainfall. Results show efficiency of the methodology in determination of contacts between different deposits at depth, showing an increase in signal amplitude at the contact between the original deposits from low to\nhigh compaction. Precipitation is not relevant for signal attenuation in the sandy deposits studied", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Carolina G. Leandro  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Eduardo G.
