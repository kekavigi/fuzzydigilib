{"Nomor": 38148, "Judul": "Bose-Fermi cancellations without supersymmetry", "Abstrak": "We show that adjoint QCD features very strong Bose-Fermi cancellations in the large-N limit, despite\nthe fact that it is manifestly nonsupersymmetric. The difference between the bosonic and fermionic\ndensities of states in large-N adjoint QCD turns out to have a \u201ctwo-dimensional\u201d scaling ? exp\u00f0\n(formula) plE\u00de for large energies E in finite spatial volume, where l is a length scale associated with the curvature of the spatial manifold. In particular, all Hagedorn growth cancels, and so does the growth exp \u00f0V1=4E3=4\u00de expected in a standard local four-dimensional theory in spatial volume V. In these ways, large-N adjoint QCD, a manifestly nonsupersymmetric theory, acts similarly to supersymmetric theories.We also show that at large-N the vacuum energy of multiflavor adjoint QCD is non-negative and exponentially small compared to the UV cutoff with several natural regulators.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Aleksey Cherman [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mikhail Shifman,", "and Mithat Unsal"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW D 99, 105001 (2019); Published by the American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Mei 2019"}
