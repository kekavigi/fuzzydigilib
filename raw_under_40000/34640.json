{"Nomor": 34640, "Judul": "Symposium Review of \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdBalkan Locus-Focus:  Long 20th Century Visual Communication  Design Histories", "Abstrak": "Media reports on the Balkans usually tend to present the region in a very sensationalist way, picturing it as a center of political unrest, economic downturn, social instability and never-ending ethnic conflicts. This sort of discourse is partly justifiable given its turbulent history in the last five centuries, but tends to neglect the diversity of cultures that are historically found in the region. A two-day symposium Balkan Locus-Focus: Long 20th Century Visual Communication Design Histories, tried for the first time to map the history of visual communication design in the region, which has been noticeably absent from any global design historiography. Organized by Izmir University of Economics (IEU, Turkey) in collaboration with Parsons the New School for Design (United States), the symposium  brought  together  a  wide  range  of  design  historians, practitioners and theorists from the Balkans (Croatia, Serbia,  Slovenia,  Bosnia,  Turkey  and  Greece)  and  outside  the  region (United Kingdom, Poland, Germany, and Italy).", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ksenija Berk [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Visual communication design, history", "Sumber": "Izmir University of Economics (IEU), Izmir, Turkey (June 29\u201330 2012)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Feb 2019"}
