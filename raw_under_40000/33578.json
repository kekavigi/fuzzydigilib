{"Nomor": 33578, "Judul": "Adsorption of Methylmercury onto Geobacter bemidijensis Bem", "Abstrak": "The anaerobic bacterium Geobacter bemidijensis Bem has\nthe unique ability to both produce and degrade methylmercury\n(MeHg). While the adsorption of MeHg onto bacterial surfaces can\naffect the release of MeHg into aquatic environments as well as the\nuptake of MeHg for demethylation, the binding of MeHg to the\nbacterial envelope remains poorly understood. In this study, we\nquantified the adsorption of MeHg onto G. bemidijensis and applied Xray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to elucidate the mechanism of\nMeHg binding. The results showed MeHg adsorption onto G.\nbemidijensis cell surfaces was rapid and occurred via complexation to\nsulfhydryl functional groups. Titration experiments yielded cell surface\nsulfhydryl concentrations of 3.8 \u00b1 0.2 ?mol/g (wet cells). A one-site\nadsorption model with MeHg binding onto sulfhydryl sites provided\nexcellent fits to adsorption isotherms conducted at different cell densities. The log K binding constant of MeHg onto the\nsulfhydryl sites was determined to be 10.5 \u00b1 0.4. These findings provide a quantitative framework to describe MeHg binding\nonto bacterial cell surfaces and elucidate the importance of bacterial cells as possible carriers of adsorbed MeHg in natural\naquatic systems.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yuwei Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Qiang Yu.,Bhoopesh Mishra.,\u00a7 Jeffra K.
