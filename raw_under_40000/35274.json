{"Nomor": 35274, "Judul": "Overview of strategies for enhanced treatment of municipal/domestic wastewater at low temperature", "Abstrak": "Biological wastewater treatment has been widely applied to municipal/domestic wastewater treatment systems.\nHowever, low temperature significantly decreases process performance. Furthermore, increasingly stringent effluent discharge standards are causing wastewater treatment facilities to have to improve and maintain contaminants removal under low temperature. Hence, this review aims to summarize strategies for enhanced treatment\nof municipal/domestic wastewater at low temperature. First, mechanisms of the effects of low temperature on\nwastewater treatment, including physiological characteristics, microbial growth rate, microbial activity, microbial community structure and sludge settleability, are analyzed. Strategies for performance intensifications at\nlow temperature, mainly operational parameters regulation, bioaugmentation, biofilm technology, chemical\nphosphorus precipitation and application of novel process technologies, are then reviewed. Finally, future directions to address low temperature wastewater are highlighted. A special emphasis is given to the application of\nnovel process/technology configurations to enhance process performance at low temperature in practical\nengineering.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hexi Zhou [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xin Li.,Guoren Xu.,Huarong Yu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Low temperature Municipal/domestic wastewater Enhanced treatment Operational strategies", "Sumber": "Science of the Total Environment 643 (2018) 225\u2013237", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Feb 2019"}
