{"Nomor": 32399, "Judul": "The Sequent Calculus of Skew Monoidal Categories", "Abstrak": "Szlach\u00b4anyi\u2019s skew monoidal categories are a well-motivated variation of monoidal categories in which the\nunitors and associator are not required to be natural isomorphisms, but merely natural transformations in\na particular direction. We present a sequent calculus for skew monoidal categories, building on the recent\nformulation by one of the authors of a sequent calculus for the Tamari order (skew semigroup categories). In\nthis calculus, antecedents consist of a stoup (an optional formula) followed by a context (a list of formulae),\nand the connectives unit and tensor behave like in intuitionistic non-commutative linear logic (the logic\nof monoidal categories) except that the left rules may only be applied in stoup position. We show the\nadmissibility of two forms cut (stoup cut and context cut), and prove the calculus sound and complete with\nrespect to existence of maps in the free skew monoidal category. We then introduce an equivalence relation\non sequent calculus derivations and prove that there is a one-to-one correspondence between equivalence\nclasses of derivations and maps in the free skew monoidal category. Finally, we identify a subcalculus of\nfocused derivations, and establish that it contains exactly one canonical representative from each equivalence\nclass. As an end result, we obtain simple algorithms both for deciding equality of maps in the free skew\nmonoidal category and for enumerating any homset without duplicates, in particular, for deciding whether\nthere is a map. We have formalized this development in the dependently typed programming language\nAgda.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Tarmo Uustalu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Niccol`o Veltri", "Noam Zeilberger"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Matematika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Analysis", "Kata Kunci": "skew monoidal categories, substructural logics, sequent calculus, nonstandard sequent forms, cut admissibility, focusing, Agda", "Sumber": "Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science 341 (2018) 345\u2013370", "Staf Input/Edit": "Dwi Ary Fuziastuti \u00a0\n                                     Dwi Ary Fuziastuti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
