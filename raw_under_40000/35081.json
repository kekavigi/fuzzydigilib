{"Nomor": 35081, "Judul": "FERMI-ARC-INDUCED VORTEX STRUCTURE IN WEYL BEAM SHIFTS", "Abstrak": "In periodic media, despite the close relationship between geometrical effects in the bulk and topological\nsurface states, the two are typically probed separately.We show that when beams in aWeyl medium reflect\noff an interface with a gapped medium, the trajectory is influenced by both bulk geometrical effects and the\nFermi arc surface states. The reflected beam experiences a displacement, analogous to the Goos-H\u00e4nchen\nor Imbert-Fedorov shifts, that forms a half-vortex in the two-dimensional surface momentum space. The\nhalf-vortex is centered where the Fermi arc of the reflecting surface touches the Weyl cone, with the\nmagnitude of the shift scaling as an inverse square root away from the touching point, and diverging at\nthe touching point. This striking feature provides a way to use bulk transport to probe the topological\ncharacteristics of a Weyl medium.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "UDVAS CHATTOPADHYAY [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["LI-KUN SHI,", "BAILE ZHANG,", "JUSTIN C.
