Large corporations are entering the virtual worlds of MMORPGs\nthrough advertising; yet, few studies have examined the relationship between virtual identities, virtual\nconsumption and real world consumption. This study formulates a preliminary taxonomy of user motivations\nfor playing Second Life and addresses how these diverse reasons impact both virtual and \u2018real\nworld\u2019 consumer behaviors. A total of 209 participants completed a Web-based questionnaire. The independent\nvariable in the study was motivation for using Second Life, and respondents completed measures\nof frequency of purchasing different products, motivations for using Second Life, and demographic characteristics.\nResults are consistent with the expectation that not all Second Life users are the same in their\nmotivations or behaviors, despite popular media coverage of the phenomenon.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ashleigh K.
