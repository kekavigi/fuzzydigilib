{"Nomor": 34856, "Judul": "Effect of the clump size for bonded particle model on the uniaxial and tensile strength ratio of rock", "Abstrak": "The Discrete Element Method (DEM) has been increasingly used to study the behaviour of rock. Despite the\nadvantage of classical DEM formulations in using simple interaction laws to model fracture initiation and propagation, they have limitations to properly simulate brittle rock behaviour. The code cannot predict the high\nvalues of unconfined compressive strength/tensile strength (UCS/TS) ratio associated with non-linear failure\nenvelopes, as observed for hard rock, such as granite, unless significant modifications are made. This paper\nproposes and implements a clumped-particle model into a two-dimensional DEM code. The increase in the\ninteraction between discrete elements, which locally increases the density of interparticle bonds, can improve\nthe results to obtain the desired values of UCS/TS ratio. This approach seems able to significantly increase both\nthe potential and the predictive capabilities of DEM for rock modelling purposes. The novelties introduced in this\nwork are the presentation of a numerical procedure to determine the equivalent micro-mechanical properties of\nintact rocks and, aware of a gap in our knowledge, the characterisation of uncertainties that a clumped-particle\nmodel introduces in the numerical results. A series of numerical simulations, including uniaxial compression and\ndirect tension tests, were carried out, by varying the relation between the clump and the minimum particle\nradius, using the Monte Carlo simulation technique. The results were compared with experimental data on Lac\ndu Bonnet granite, from the bibliography, which allowed to determine the equivalent micro-mechanical properties. Results, from a simulation using a core sample of Lac du Bonnet granite, show that the variance in the\nvalues of the mechanical properties calculated decreases with the decrease in the particle radius, but the influence of the clump size on the behaviour requires the execution of a considerable amount of simulations to\nachieve results with an acceptable relative error of 5%. Nevertheless, the mechanical behaviour obtained from\nDEM simulations was in good agreement with the experimental data and the model captured both the tensile and\nthe unconfined compression strength values.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "JOAO MANSO [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jo\u00e3o Marcelino and Laura Caldeira"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Discrete element method, Brittle behaviour, UCS/TS ratio, Clumped particles", "Sumber": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrmms.2018.12.024", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Feb 2019"}
