{"Nomor": 39075, "Judul": "Soft Tendril-Inspired Grippers: Shape Morphing of Programmable Polymer?Paper Bilayer Composites", "Abstrak": "Nastic movements in plants that occur in response to environmental\nstimuli have inspired many man-made shape-morphing systems. Tendril is an\nexemplification serving as a parasitic grasping component for the climbing plants by\ntransforming from a straight shape into a coiled configuration via the asymmetric\ncontraction of internal stratiform plant tissues. Inspired by tendrils, this study using a\nthree-dimensional (3D) printing approach developed a class of soft grippers with\npreprogrammed deformations being capable of imitating the general motions of plant\ntendrils, including bending, spiral, and helical distortions for grasping. These grippers\ninitially in flat configurations were tailored from a polymer?paper bilayer composite\nsheet fabricated via 3D printing a polymer on the paper substrate with different\npatterns. The rough and porous paper surface provides a printed polymer that is well-adhered to the paper substrate which in\nturn serves as a passive strain-limiting layer. During printing, the melted polymer filament is stretched, enabling the internal strain\nto be stored in the printed polymer as memory, and then it can be thermally released, which will be concurrently resisted by the\npaper layer, resulting in various transformations based on the different printed geometries. These obtained transformations were\nthen used for designing grippers to grasp objects with corresponding motions. Furthermore, a fully equipped robotic tendril with\nthree segments was reproduced, where one segment was used for grasping the object and the other two segments were used for\nforming a tendril-like twistless spring-like structure. This study further helps in the development of soft robots using active\npolymer materials for engineered systems.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Weike Wang 1.pdf?_": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170995"}, "Penulis": "Wei Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Chenzhe Li, Maenghyo Cho, Sung-Hoon Ahn"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "biomimetics, tendril, shape shifting, 3D/4D printing, soft robotics, soft gripper", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
