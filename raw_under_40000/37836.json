A large-scale parallel discrete element code (THDEM: TsingHua Discrete\nElement Method) was used to obtain a satisfying statistical description of the structural and mechanical\nproperties near point J. The isostatic compressions of 100,000 polydispersed frictionless\nparticles were simulated on high performance computers to clearly observe the sophisticated configurations\nof force chains. The first peak of the pair correlation function, coordination number,\nspatial distribution of the packing fraction, and stress were calculated to analyze their variations\nwith increasing packing fraction. The critical packing fraction at point J is determined to be\n0.62. The incremental stress and coordination number from point J scale well with the power\nlaw, and coincide with previous theoretical predications. The distribution of the packing fraction\nis a normal distribution around the average value. The standard deviation decreases with\nincreasing packing fraction, indicating the system is more uniform with a denser packing.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jianguo Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Qicheng Sun, Feng Jin, Qingkai Liu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "granular matter, jamming transition, force chains, parallel computing", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect: Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 27, No. 2, April, 2014", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Apr 2019"}
