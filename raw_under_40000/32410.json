{"Nomor": 32410, "Judul": "Probing ultrafast vibrational dynamics of intramolecular hydrogen bonds with broadband infrared pump-probe spectroscopy", "Abstrak": "In this study we use ultrafast infrared (IR) pump-probe spectroscopy to study the vibrational dynamics of two intramolecular hydrogen bonded complexes, 10-\nhydroxybenzo[h]quinoline (HBQ) and 2-(2?-hydroxyphenyl)benzothiazole (HBT) dissolved in carbon tetrachloride. We pump the OH stretching (?OH) mode and\nprobe across 1800 cm?1\u20133300 cm?1 using a broadband IR probe pulse. Both systems exhibit large anharmonicities (> 250 cm?1), which are characteristic of\nmedium strong hydrogen bonded systems. Additionally, we observe the coherent beating of low-frequency modes of 245 cm?1 and 118 cm?1 across the ?OH stretch\nof HBQ and HBT, respectively. Anharmonic frequency calculations at the DFT level identify these low-frequency structural modes as in-plane bending modes, which\nmodulate the intramolecular hydrogen bonding distance. These findings provide evidence that the anharmonic nature of the fundamental ?OH stretch is primarily\ndictated by the coupling to low-frequency structural modes and these motions play an important role in the hydrogen bonding dynamics.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Madhumitha Balasubramanian,  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Anthony Reynolds", "Tyler J", "Blair", "Munira Khalil."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Physical chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "chemical physics 519 (2019) 38-44", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor \u00a0\n                                     Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
