{"Nomor": 36120, "Judul": "Source parameters estimation by the normalized downward continuation of gravity gradient data", "Abstrak": "Normalized downward continuation (NDC) method calculates the normalization on the analytical signal\nmodulus of the downward continued field or the downward continuation of the potential field itself,\nwhich is used to obtain the edges position and buried depth information. In this study, we applied the\nNDC method to the edge detector defined as the combination of the directional total horizontal derivatives\n(DTHD) to improve the lateral resolution. The iterative downward continuation is introduced in the computation\nprocess which has a large downward continuation distance. The synthetic gravity data with and\nwithout noise are used to test the effectiveness of the new presented approach. The results show that\nNDC applied to the edge detector based on DTHD has a better resolution than the previous method based\non the directional analytic signals, and the source edges and depth information can be obtained simultaneously.\nFinally, we apply the method to the gravity data acquired over the Humble Salt Dome in USA.\nThe results show a good correspondence to the previous work results", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Shuai Zhou [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jibing Jiang, Pengyu Lu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Source parameters Normalized downward continuation Gravity gradient data", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 147 (2017) 81\u201390, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.10.011", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Mar 2019"}
