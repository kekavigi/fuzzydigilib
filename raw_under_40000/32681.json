{"Nomor": 32681, "Judul": "Research of concrete dam leakage detection based on anomaly current field of reservoir water", "Abstrak": "It's vital to determine the placement of the leakage inlets in the dam upstream face, because dam leakage usually\nresults in engineering hazards such as increase in uplift pressure and aggravating frost-heaving and freeze-thaw\ndamage. According to the numerical simulation of the constant electric field present around the concrete dam\nbody, we analyzed the relationship between local potential difference (current density) and leakage areas, and\nthe influence of low-resistance material on the detection of leakage areas. Numerical simulations show that\nunder the on-site data of potential difference, we can detect inlets in the dam's upstream face successfully.\nThis paper attempts to propose a field detection method to detect dam leakage inlets. This new technique and\ntheoretical basis in operational testing and safety management can be applied to concrete dams. Practical application proves that leakage areas can be recognized accurately, and the results agree well with existing hydraulic\nobservation data and geological information. We suggest that the electrical current field detection of reservoir\nwater leakage areas can be used as a reasonable and effective method to detect concrete dam leakage", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yongdong Meng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yixiaosuo Fang, Miao Wan, Qingming Su, Bin Tian, Fuguo Tong"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Engineering safety Concrete dam Current field Leakage detection", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 160 (2019) 242\u2013253, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.11.016", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Des 2018"}
