{"Nomor": 37720, "Judul": "Effects of tunneling and multiphoton transitions on squeezed-state generation in bistable driven systems", "Abstrak": "Bistability of a nonlinear resonantly driven oscillator in the presence of external noise is analyzed using the classical Fokker\u2013Planck equation in the quasienergy space with account for tunneling effects and by quantum master equation in quasienergy states representation. Two timescales responsible for different stages of this bistable system relaxation have been obtained. We found that the slow relaxation rate caused by fluctuationinduced transitions between different stable states can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude due to the tunneling effects. It was also revealed that tunneling between nearly degenerate quasienergy states and resonant multiphoton transitions between the genuine eigenstates of the nonlinear oscillator are just the similar effects. It was demonstrated that the quasienergy states in the bistability region corresponding to higher amplitude are squeezed. The degree of squeezing is determined by the ratio between nonlinearity and detuning, so that the uncertainty of one quadrature can be considerably smaller than the quantum limit.We found that tunneling effects can enhance the generation of output oscillator squeezed states. It was demonstrated that 1D FokkerPlanck equation is a quasiclassical limit of a quantum master equation.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Natalya S.
