{"Nomor": 36028, "Judul": "NONLINEAR RESONANCES GENERATE LARGE-SCALE CONVECTION CELLS IN PHASE SPACE", "Abstrak": "It is well known that resonance phenomena can destroy adiabatic invariance and cause chaos and mixing.\nIn the present Rapid Communication, we show that a nonlinear wave-particle resonant interaction may do\nthe opposite\u2014generate large-scale coherent structures in phase space. The combined action of the drift due to nonlinear scattering on resonance and trapping (capture) into resonance creates a convection cell-like structure, where the areas of particle acceleration and deceleration are macroscopically separated. At the same time, nonlinear scattering also creates a diffusion that cause mixing on and between the energy levels.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "FAN WU [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["DMITRI VAINCHTEIN,", "AND ANTON ARTEMYEV"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW E 99, 020201(R) (2019); \u00a92019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Mar 2019"}
