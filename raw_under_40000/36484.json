{"Nomor": 36484, "Judul": "Electrical and seismic response of saline permafrost soil during freeze - Thaw transition", "Abstrak": "We conducted laboratory studies on the geophysical signals from Arctic saline permafrost soils to help\nunderstand the physical and mechanical processes during freeze-thaw cycles. Our results revealed low electrical\nresistivity (b20 ?m) and elastic moduli (7.7 GPa for Young's modulus and 2.9 GPa for shear modulus) at temperatures down to ~?10 \u00b0C, indicating the presence of a significant amount of unfrozen saline water under the\ncurrent field conditions. The spectral induced polarization signal showed a systematic shift during the freezing\nprocess, affected by concurrent changes of temperature, salinity, and ice formation. An anomalous induced polarization response was first observed during the transient period of supercooling and the onset of ice nucleation.\nSeismic measurements showed a characteristic maximal attenuation at the temperatures immediately below\nthe freezing point, followed by a decrease with decreasing temperature. The calculated elastic moduli showed\na non-hysteric response during the freeze \u2013 thaw cycle, which was different from the concurrently measured\nelectrical resistivity response where a differential resistivity signal is observed depending on whether the soil\nis experiencing freezing or thawing. The differential electrical resistivity signal presents challenges for unfrozen\nwater content estimation based on Archie's law. Using an improved formulation of Archie's law with a variable\ncementation exponent, the unfrozen water content estimation showed a large variation depending on the choice\nof the resistivity data during either a freezing or thawing cycle. Combining the electrical and seismic results, we\nsuggest that, rather than a large hysteresis in the actual unfrozen water content, the shift of the resistivity\nresponse may reflect the changes of the distribution pattern of the unfrozen water (or ice) in the soil matrix\nduring repeated freeze and thaw processes. Collectively, our results provide an improved petrophysical understanding of the physical and mechanical properties of saline permafrost during freeze \u2013 thaw transitions, and suggest that large uncertainty may exist when estimating the unfrozen water content using electrical resistivity data", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yuxin Wu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Seiji Nakagawa, Timothy J.
