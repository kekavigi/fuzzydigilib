{"Nomor": 37659, "Judul": "Using the coherence function for noise reduction", "Abstrak": "With the development of hand-free\nradio communications there is great interest in\nnoise cancelling or speech enhancement in a car.\nWe assume that M observations are available;\neach one is composed of signal and noise (si + b,),\nand s1 is the signal to be estimated. Whatever the\ndistance between microphones is, the signals are\nstrongly correlated, while the correlation between\nnoises becomes rather weak for a sufficiently great\ndistance. The coherence function is then a pertinent\ncriterion to know whether a speech signal\nexists or not. The three methods presented use the\ncoherence function to filter the observations so\ngiving an estimate of the signal sl. The procedures\npresented are first shown for M = 2. Then, a generalisation\nof these procedures is offered. The performances\nof the three methods have been\nevaluated on real noisy speech signals by objective\ntests (gain on the signal-to-noise ratio, distance\nmeasures) and informal listening tests.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "R.
