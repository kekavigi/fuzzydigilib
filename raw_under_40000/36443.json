{"Nomor": 36443, "Judul": "Structural Solutions for Low-Cost Bamboo Frames: Experimental Tests and Constructive Assessments", "Abstrak": "Experimental tests and constructive assessments are presented for a simple bamboo\nframed structure with innovative low-cost and low technology joints, specifically conceived for small\nbuildings in developing countries. Two full scale one-storey bamboo frames have been designed by\nusing the simplest joints solution among three different tested typologies. The entire building process\nis based on low-technology and natural materials: bamboo canes, wooden cylinders, plywood plates\nand canap\u00e9 rods. The first full scale specimen (Unit A) is a one-storey single deck truss structure\nsubjected to monotonic collapse test; the second full scale specimen (Unit B) is a one-storey double\ndeck truss structure used to evaluate the construction time throughout assembling tests. The first\nfull scale specimen showed ductility in collapse and ease in strengthening; the second one showed\nremarkable ease and speed in assembling structural elements. Finally several constructive solutions\nare suggested for the design of simple one-storey buildings; they are addressed to four purposes\n(housing, school, chapel, health center) by the composition of the proposed full scale bamboo frames.\nEase of use and maintenance with a low level of technology contribute to application in developing\ncountries although not exclusively.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mauro Sassu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Anna De Falco, Linda Giresini and Mario Lucio Puppio"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Building materials", "Kata Kunci": "bamboo; low-cost construction; full scale testing; experimental tests; one-storey buildings", "Sumber": "www.mdpi.com/journal/materials", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Mar 2019"}
