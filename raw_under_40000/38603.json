{"Nomor": 38603, "Judul": "Mechanochemistry: Toward Sustainable Design of Advanced Nanomaterials for Electrochemical Energy Storage and Catalytic Applications", "Abstrak": "Mechanochemistry has emerged as one of the\nmost interesting synthetic protocols to produce new materials.\nSolvent-free methodologies lead to unique chemical processes\nduring synthesis with the consequent formation of nanomaterials\nwith new properties. The development of mechanochemistry as a\nsynthetic method is supported by excellent results in a wide\nrange of applications. This feature highlights some representative\ncontributions focused on protocols that could be easily extended\nto the synthesis of other advanced nanomaterials. Materials for\nbatteries, supercapacitors, and catalytic processes are discussed,\nindicating the potential future directions of each field.\nTheoretical aspects and a revision of recent real in situ analyses\nof the synthesis procedures are also featured. This contribution\nattempts to present, in a comprehensive way, mechanochemistry as an open research line and a consolidated methodology to\nsynthesize advanced nanomaterials.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Mario J.
