{"Nomor": 33817, "Judul": "Improved Environmental Status: 50 Years of Declining Fish Mercury Levels in Boreal and Subarctic Fennoscandia", "Abstrak": ": Temporally (1965?2015) and spatially (55\u00b0?70\u00b0N) extensive\nrecords of total mercury (Hg) in freshwater fish showed consistent declines in\nboreal and subarctic Fennoscandia. The database contains 54 560 fish entries\n(n: pike > perch ? brown trout > roach ? Arctic charr) from 3132 lakes across\nSweden, Finland, Norway, and Russian Murmansk area. 74% of the lakes did\nnot meet the 0.5 ppm limit to protect human health. However, after 2000 only\n25% of the lakes exceeded this level, indicating improved environmental status.\nIn lakes where local pollution sources were identified, pike and perch Hg\nconcentrations were significantly higher between 1965 and 1990 compared to\nvalues after 1995, likely an effect of implemented reduction measures. In lakes\nwhere Hg originated from long-range transboundary air pollution (LRTAP),\nconsistent Hg declines (3?7\u2030 per year) were found for perch and pike in both\nboreal and subarctic Fennoscandia, suggesting common environmental controls.\nHg in perch and pike in LRTAP lakes showed minimal declines with latitude, suggesting that drivers affected by temperature,\nsuch as growth dilution, counteracted Hg loading and food web exposure. We recommend that future fish Hg monitoring\nsampling design should include repeated sampling and collection of pollution history, water chemistry, fish age, and stable\nisotopes to enable evaluation of emission reduction policies.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hans Fredrik Veiteberg Braaten [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Staffan \u00c5kerblom.,Kimmo K.
