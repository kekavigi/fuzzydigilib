{"Nomor": 34158, "Judul": "A comparative study for the source depth estimation of very low electromagnetic (VLF-EM) signal", "Abstrak": "In general, a quantitative interpretation of geophysical data yields information on the\nnature of subsurface structures of geologic interest besides depth of the source and the\nassociated physical property contrast. However, all geophysical interpretation\ninvariably incurs an inherent ambiguity including VLF-EM method. Techniques such\nas Karous-Hjelt (K-H) current density, Hilbert transform etc. are in vogue to estimate\nthe depth to the source that are either qualitative or semi quantitative. Here, we\npresent a comparative analysis of the depth derived from VLF-EM signals by\ndifferent methods over a uranium rich basement fractures of Raigarh field, India. The\nobtained results are based on techniques that are not very common in VLF-EM data\ninterpretation such as Euler deconvolution (ED), Hartley spectral analysis and\nanalytical signal approach of denoised in-phase component realized by Empirical\nEnsemble Mode Decomposition (EEMD). The estimated depth from ED and Hartley\nspectral analysis range 10-62 m and 12-40 m respectively are compared with K-H\npseudo section, Hilbert transform and drilling depth. Overall, the results of the\naforesaid techniques have shown satisfactory comparison wherein Hilbert transform\nof EEMD de-noised in-phase component of traverse T1 (35m), Hartely power\nspectrum of the principal profile PPQ (40 m) and the radially averaged power\nspectrum (38.8 m and 40 m) are close to the drilling depth. Therefore, the results\nobtained by methods presented emphasize that these techniques are equally applicable\nto VLF-EM signal for estimation of depth to subsurface conductors.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "A.
