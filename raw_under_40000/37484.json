{"Nomor": 37484, "Judul": "Effects of Landscape Design on Urban Microclimate and Thermal Comfort in Tropical Climate", "Abstrak": "A climate-responsive landscape design can create a more livable urban microclimate with adequate human comfortability. is paper aims to quantitatively investigate the effects of landscape design elements of pavement materials, greenery, and water bodies on urban microclimate and thermal comfort in a high-rise residential area in the tropic climate of Singapore. A comprehensive field measurement is undertaken to obtain real data on microclimate parameters for calibration of the microclimate-modeling software ENVI-met 4.0. With the calibrated ENVI-met, seven urban landscape scenarios are simulated and their effects on\nthermal comfort as measured by physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) are evaluated. It is found that the maximum improvement of PET reduction with suggested landscape designs is about 12\u00b0C, and high-albedo pavement materials and water bodies are not effective in reducing heat stress in hot and humid climate conditions. The combination of shade trees over grass is the most effective landscape strategy for cooling the microclimate. The findings from the paper can equip urban designers with\nknowledge and techniques to mitigate urban heat stress.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Wei Yang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yaolin Lin , and Chun-Qing"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Landscape Design ; Urban Microclimate ; Thermal Comfort ; Tropical Climate", "Sumber": "Advances in Meteorology Volume 2018, Article ID 2809649, 13 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/2809649", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur \u00a0\n                                     Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Mar 2019"}
