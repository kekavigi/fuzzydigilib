{"Nomor": 32671, "Judul": "Engineering Students\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd Views of Corporate Social Responsibility: A Case Study from Petroleum Engineering", "Abstrak": "The mining and energy industries present unique challenges to engineers,\nwho must navigate sometimes competing responsibilities and codes of conduct,\nsuch as personal senses of right and wrong, professional ethics codes, and their\nemployers\u2019 corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies. Corporate social\nresponsibility (CSR) is the current dominant framework used by industry to conceptualize firms\u2019 responsibilities to their stakeholders, yet has it plays a relatively\nminor role in engineering ethics education. In this article, we report on an interdisciplinary pedagogical intervention in a petroleum engineering seminar that\nsought to better prepare engineering undergraduate students to critically appraise the\nstrengths and limitations of CSR as an approach to reconciling the interests of\nindustry and communities. We find that as a result of the curricular interventions,\nengineering students were able to expand their knowledge of the social, rather than\nsimply environmental and economic dimensions of CSR. They remained hesitant,\nhowever, in identifying the links between those social aspects of CSR and their\nactual engineering work. The study suggests that CSR may be a fruitful arena from\nwhich to illustrate the profoundly sociotechnical dimensions of the engineering\nchallenges relevant to students\u2019 future careers.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "JESSICA M.
