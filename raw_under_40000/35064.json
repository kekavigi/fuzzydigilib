{"Nomor": 35064, "Judul": "CO2 Flooding Strategy To Enhance Heavy Oil Recovery", "Abstrak": "CO2 flooding is one of the most promising techniques to enhance both light and heavy oil recovery.\nIn light oil recovery, the production pressure in CO2 flooding in general keeps constant in order to\nmaintain the miscibility of injected CO2 and crude oil; while in heavy oil recovery, a depleting\npressure scheme may be able to induce foamy oil flow, thus the oil recovery could be further\nenhanced. In this study, different pressure control schemes were tested by 1-D core-flooding experiments to obtain an optimized one. Numerical simulations were conducted to history match all\nexperimental data to understand the mechanisms and characteristics of different CO2 flooding\nstrategies.\nFor the core-flooding experiments, 1500 mD sandstone cores, formation brine and a heavy oil\nsample with a viscosity of about 869.3 cp at reservoir condition (55 C and 11 MPa) were used.\nBefore each CO2 flooding test, early stage water-flooding was conducted until the water cut reached\n90%. Different CO2 injection rates and production pressure control strategies were tested through\ncore-flooding experiments. Experimental results indicated that a slower CO2 injection rate (2 ml/\nmin) led to a higher recovery factor from 31.1% to 36.7%, compared with a high CO2 injection rate of\n7 ml/min; for the effects of different production strategies, a constant production pressure at the\nproduction port yielded a recovery factor of 31.1%; while a pressure depletion with 47.2 kPa/min at\nthe production port yielded 7% more oil recovery; and the best pressure control scheme in which\nthe production pressure keeping constant during CO2 injection period, then depleting the model\npressure with the injector shut-in yielded a recovery factor of 42.5% of the initial OOIP.\nFor the numerical simulations study, the same oil relative permeability curve was applied to\nmatch the experimental results to all tests. Different gas relative permeability curves were obtained\nwhen the production pressure schemes are different. A much lower gas relative permeability curve\nand a higher critical gas saturation were achieved in the best pressure control scheme case\ncompared to other cases. The lower gas relative permeability curve indicates that foamy oil was\nformed in the pressure depletion processes. Through this study, it is suggested that the pressure\ncontrol scheme can b", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Tuo Huang  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiang Zhou", "Huaijun Yang", "Guangzhi Liao", "Fanhua Zeng"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "CO2 flooding, Foamy oil, Enhanced oil recovery, Relative permeability curve, Numerical simulation", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 3, Issue 1, Pages 68-78 (March 2017)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Feb 2019"}
