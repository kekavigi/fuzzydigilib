{"Nomor": 33234, "Judul": "The Study of CO2 Absorption Intensification Using Porous Media Material In Aqueous AMP Solution", "Abstrak": "In this work, the performance of CO2 absorption into aqueous 2-amino-2-methyl-propanol (AMP)\nsolution was investigated by measuring the amount of CO2 in the liquid phase during CO2 absorption process to identify initial CO2 absorption rate. Then, the porous media material named as\nMCM41 was introduced into the amine solution to test its influence on CO2 absorption. It was found\nthat MCM41 increased initial CO2 absorption rate and enhanced CO2 absorption process. The\nphysico-chemical properties of MCM41 were characterized in terms of specific surface area, average\npore diameter, total pore volume and chemical properties, the amount of acidic sites and the\nBrfnsted/Lewis (B/L) acid sites ratio. Results showed that MCM41 was a type of Lewis acid catalyst\nwith large specific surface area and pore volume. In addition, the pKa of AMP solution with and\nwithout MCM41 was obtained using acid titration technology to help understand the effect brought\nby MCM41. A mechanism illustrating how MCM41 increases the CO2 absorption rate of the AMP\nsolution was proposed and demonstrated that MCM41 is a potential material for enhancing CO2\nabsorption.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MIN XIAO [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Helei Liu , Haiyan Zhang, Yanqing Na, Paitoon Tontiwachwuthikul, Zhiwu Liang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "CO2 absorption, 2-amino-2-methyl-propanol, MCM41", "Sumber": "Petroleum 4 (2018) 90-94 - KeAi, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2017.05.002", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Jan 2019"}
