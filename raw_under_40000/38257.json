{"Nomor": 38257, "Judul": "A POLITICAL-CULTURAL STUDIES PROGRAMME IN ROSARIO (ARGENTINA)", "Abstrak": "This  article  describes  a  particular  academic  situation  in  which  the  authors\norganized a Cultural Studies programme in a specific place: the city of Rosario in\nArgentina.  Our  programme  attempts  to  free  itself  from  the  curricular  malaise\nprovoked  by  the  disconnect  between  the  university  and  society  and  at  the  same\ntime, it is the product of a paradoxical situation. Many who claim to do Cultural\nStudies rarely cross the borders of their own discipline, nor do they lend themselves\nto  interdisciplinary  dialogue.  In  the  face  of  this,  we  proceed  from  the  need  to\nattend to the specific forms of contextualization in which knowledge is produced.\nWe hew to a local logic in formulating the objectives of our programme. Still, this\nlocality does not mean that we forget about global frameworks and transnational\nspaces and their determining effects. Rosario is a peripheral city whose identity is\nbased not on being a central megalopolis (like Buenos Aires), but on regional and\neven transnational relations with other cities: Porto Alegre, Montevideo, Curitiba.\nThis experience has led to the formulation of a cultural strategy notable for giving\nimpulse  to  inclusive  institutional  forms  and  innovative  cultural  policies.  We  do\nCultural Studies hoping to foment a critical look from our region, to contribute to\nthe formation of agents that can act dynamically in our contemporaneity, not only\nto understand  but to be involved in our social processes.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Monica Bernabe  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sandra Valdettaro"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "culture; politic; local; global; Argentina; Cultural Studies", "Sumber": "Cultural Studies Vol. 26, No. 1 January 2012, pp. 29-38", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Mei 2019"}
