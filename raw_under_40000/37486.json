This paper proposes a spacecraft altitude estimationmethod for the CNS based on infrared Earth measurement. An infrared Earth sensor first determines the Earthobservation vector between the spacecraft and the Earth center relative to the inertial frame.

Compared to high-altitudemissions with different altitudes, the altitude estimation accuracy is limited into 0.4% of the true altitude.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP BIN GOU 1": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164628"}, "Penulis": "Bin Gou [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yong-meiCheng and Anton H.J.de Ruiter"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Celestial navigation system, Infrared Earth sensor, Altitude", "Sumber": "Acta Astronautica Volume 159, June 2019, Pages 105-111", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Mar 2019"}
