{"Nomor": 34444, "Judul": "Emergence Of Nanotechnology In The Oil And Gas Industry: Emphasis On The Application Of Silica Nanoparticles", "Abstrak": "The application of nanotechnology in the oil and gas industry is on the rise as evidenced by the\nnumber of researches undertaken in the past few years. The quest to develop more game-changing\ntechnologies that can address the challenges currently facing the industry has spurred this growth.\nSeveral nanoparticles, of different sizes and at different concentrations, have been used in many\ninvestigations.\nIn this work, the scope of the study covered the application of nanotechnology in drilling and\nhydraulic fracturing fluids, oilwell cementing, enhanced oil recovery (which includes transport\nstudy, and foam and emulsion stability), corrosion inhibition, logging operations, formation fines\ncontrol during production, heavy oil viscosity reduction, hydrocarbon detection, methane release\nfrom gas hydrates, and drag reduction in porous media. The observed challenges associated with\nthe use of nanoparticles are their stability in a liquid medium and transportability in reservoir\nrocks. The addition of viscosifier was implemented by researchers to ensure stability, and also,\nsurface-treated nanoparticles have been used to facilitate stability and transportability.\nFor the purpose of achieving better performance or new application, studies on synergistic effects are suggested for investigation in future nanotechnology research. The resulting technology\nfrom the synergistic studies may reinforce the current and future nanotechnology applications in\nthe oil and gas industry, especially for high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) applications. To\ndate, majority of the oil and gas industry nanotechnology publications are reports of laboratory\nexperimental work; therefore, more field trials are recommended for further advancement of\nnanotechnology in this industry. Usually, nanoparticles are expensive; so, it will be cost beneficial\nto use the lowest nanoparticles concentration possible while still achieving an acceptable level of a\ndesired performance. Hence, optimization studies are also recommended for examination in future\nnanotechnology research.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MUILI FEYISITAN FAKOYA  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Subhash Nandlal Shah"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Nanotechnology, Silica nanoparticles, Drilling fluids, Hydraulic fracturing fluids, Enhanced oil recovery, Oilwell cementing, Oil and gas", "Sumber": "Petroleum-KeAi, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2017.03.001", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Feb 2019"}
