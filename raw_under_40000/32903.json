{"Nomor": 32903, "Judul": "Non-linear AVO inversion based on a novel exact PP reflection coefficient", "Abstrak": "The Zoeppritz equations describe the relationship between the amplitudes of the P-wave incidentwaves and the\nPP or PS reflectedwaves. Various Zoeppritz approximations arewidely used for Pre-stack seismic inversion. Nevertheless,\nthe approximations are limited in the case of critical angle and high contrast situations. Although the\nZeoppritz equations break through the constraint of weak contrast between layers and can be applied for elastic\nparameters varying severely, the difficulty of inverting for six parameters (P- and S-wave velocities, as well as\ndensity between layers) and the intrinsic nonlinearity of Zoeppritz equationmake it less appropriate in practical\napplications. Given this problem, the novel Zoeppritz-based nonlinear equation can be obtained bymeans of the\nvelocity and density terms of each layer were replaced by the P- and S-wave velocities and density reflectivity\nrespectively. The model test and real seismic data verified the feasibility and suitability of this novel exact PP reflection\ncoefficient.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xing-Yao Yin [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Guang-Sen Cheng, Zhao-Yun Zong"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Pre-stack AVO Inversion Zoeppritz equations", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 159 (2018) 408\u2013417, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.09.019", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Jan 2019"}
