Data for\nthis study were drawn from respondents from the 2010 administration of the nationwide,\nmulti-institutional survey conducted by the Strategic National Arts Alumni Project\n(SNAAP). Regarding career path, nearly half of the music performance degree graduates\nreported performing as their current job, and slightly more than half of the music education\ndegree graduates reported working in K\u201312 schools. Participants were generally satisfied\nwith their institutional experiences, although relatively low levels of satisfaction were\nreported for networking and career advising services.

The reported annual income of the\nparticipants varied significantly, with music educators reporting higher earnings than\nperformers.The purpose of this study was to examine undergraduate music education and performance\nalumni\u2019s career path, retrospective institutional satisfaction, and financial status.
