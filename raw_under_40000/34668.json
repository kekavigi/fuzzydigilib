We investigated VTEC changes related with\nModerate, Strong, Major and Great earthquakes occurred at different tectonic settings in both Himalaya and nonHimalayan regions. The VTEC and its anomalies are computed using GPS data obtained from the local network\nof GPS stations in Himalaya with the IGS stations surrounding the epicentre region. Irrespective of the source\ncharacteristics, significant CIDs are observed during Major and Great earthquakes, namely; (i) the Mw 7.8, 25th\nApril 2015 Gorkha earthquake, (ii) the Mw 7.6, 8th October 2005 Kashmir earthquake, and (iii) the Mw 8.6,\n28th March 2005 Nias\u2013Simeulue earthquake.\nThe VTEC anomalies due to the Gorkha event are observed 21.15 min after the earthquake origin time and\ncontinued till 22.78 min with the amplitude range from ?0.530 to 0.517 ( \u00b1 0.11) TECU. CIDs associated with\nthe Kashmir earthquake are noticed only at two GPS sites (NADI and PAN2) roughly after 23 min of the\nearthquake occurrence. But, it continued around 14 min with the amplitude range from ?0.12 to 0.177 TECU\n( \u00b1 0.02 TECU = 1?). However, for the case of Ocean-Island Arc Nias\u2013Simeulue earthquake, anomalous CIDs\nwere observed only at GPS site NTUS, where the disturbances started around 25.58 min later and continued\naround 17.92 min with amplitude range from ?0.077 to 0.058 TECU ( \u00b1 0.02 TECU = 1?). We inferred that the\nCIDs originated because of earthquakes in Himalaya have relatively larger VTEC magnitudes (> 15 TECU) that\npropagates faster in reaching and registering in the ionospheric layers compared with the non-Himalayan\nearthquakes. Secondly, different lithospheric-ionospheric coupling mechanism is operating in transferring the\nseismic energy, which originated from the Continent-Continent and the Tsunami genic Ocean-Island Arc collision zone, to the ionosphere", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Param K.
