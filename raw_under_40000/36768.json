{"Nomor": 36768, "Judul": "Anomalous Behavior of Anion Exchange Membrane duringOperation of a Vanadium Redox Flow Battery", "Abstrak": "Vanadium redoxflow batteries (VRFBs) are becoming an integral component of renewable energy solutions,microgrids, and backup storage systems. The reduction in cell resistance due to advancements in the electrode and overallcomponent design allowsflow cells to operate at higher current/power densities. During discharging of an experimentalflowcell at higher current densities, under certain conditions, an unexpected voltage drop and subsequent recovery were observed.Similar effects of voltage drop and recovery have been observed in NiCd and primary lithium?thionyl chloride (LTC) batteriesbut have not yet been reported for the VRFB in peer-reviewed publications. This study aims to understand the causes behindthe voltage drop effect in a VRFB under high power density operation", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Arjun_Bhattarai_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/162979"}, "Penulis": "Arjun Bhattarai [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Adam H.
