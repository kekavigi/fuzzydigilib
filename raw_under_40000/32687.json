{"Nomor": 32687, "Judul": "An empirical research framework for the aesthetic appreciation of the urban environment", "Abstrak": "The present article aims to construct an empirical research framework for the aesthetic appreciation of the urban\nenvironment. By applying the concept of \u201cenvironmental aesthetics\u201d to \u201cconsumer aesthetics,\u201d the present article\nremarks that urban environments are considered as aesthetic environments when they resemble natural environments. This article proposes an empirical research framework composed of two factors. The first factor is\nthe similarity of the urban environment to the natural environment. This factor is classified into two categories:\n(1) assimilation into the natural environment and (2) natural change caused by the passage of time. The second\nfactor is the consumer's relationship with the urban environment. This factor is also classified into two categories, borrowing the two terms of environmental aesthetics: (1) \u201cengaged\u201d and (2) \u201cobservational.\u201d This article\nalso discusses the research methods appropriate for this framework.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Keiko Makino [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Communities", "Kata Kunci": "Urban environment Natural environment Aesthetic appreciation Consumer aesthetics Environmental aesthetics Research framework", "Sumber": "City, Culture and Society 13 (2018) 1\u20137", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi \u00a0\n                                     Rd.
