{"Nomor": 33632, "Judul": "Enhancing Localized Pesticide Action through Plant Foliage by Silver-Cellulose Hybrid Patches", "Abstrak": "Efficacy and efficiency of pesticide application\nin the field through the foliage still face many challenges.\nThere exists a mismatch between the hydrophobic character\nof the leaf and the active molecule, low dispersion of the\npesticides on the leaves\u2019 surface, runoff loss, and rolling down\nof the active molecules to the field, decreasing their efficacy\nand increasing their accumulation to the soil. We produced\nbacterial cellulose-silver nanoparticles (BC-AgNPs) hybrid\npatches by in situ thermal reduction under microwave\nirradiation in a scalable manner and obtaining AgNPs strongly\nanchored to the BC. Those hybrids increase the interaction of\nthe pesticide (AgNPs) with the foliage and avoids runoff loss and rolling down of the nanoparticles. The positive antibacterial\nand antifungal properties were assessed in vitro against the bacteria Escherichia coli and two agro-economically relevant\npathogens: the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae and the fungus Botrytis cinerea. We showed in vivo inhibition of the infection in\nNicotiana benthamiana and tomato leaves, as proven by the suppression of the expression of defense molecular markers and\nreactive oxygen species production. The hydrogel-like character of the bacterial cellulose matrix increases the adherence to the\nfoliage of the patches.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Alejandro Alonso-D\u00edaz [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jordi Floriach-Clark.,Judit Fuentes.,\u2021 Montserrat Capellades.,Nuria S.
