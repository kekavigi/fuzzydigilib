{"Nomor": 38701, "Judul": "Crucial Differences in the Hydrolytic Degradation between Industrial Polylactide and Laboratory-Scale Poly(L-lactide)", "Abstrak": "The rate of degradation of large-scale synthesized polylactide (PLA) of industrial origin was compared with that of\nlaboratory-scale synthesized poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) of similar molar mass. The structural discrepancy between the two material\ntypes resulted in a significant difference in degradation rate. Although the hydrolysis of industrial PLA was substantially faster\nthan that of PLLA, the PLA material became less brittle and fragmented to a lesser extent during degradation. In addition, a\ncomprehensive picture of the degradation of industrial PLA was obtained by subjecting different PLA materials to hydrolytic\ndegradation at various temperatures and pH\u2019s for up to 182 days. The surrounding environment had no effect on the degradation\nrate at physiological temperature, but the degradation was faster in water than in a phosphate buffer after prolonged degradation\nat temperatures above the Tg. The degree of crystallinity had a greater influence than the degradation environment on the rate of\nhydrolysis. For a future use of polylactide in applications where bulk plastics are generally used today, for example plastic\npackages, the appropriate PLA grade must be chosen based on the conditions prevailing in the degradation environment.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Anders Hc\"K???_": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170179"}, "Penulis": "Anders Ho? glund [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Karin Odelius,Ann-Christine Albertsson"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "polymer materials, biodegradable, degradation, polylactide, packaging applications", "Sumber": "www.acsami.org", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Jun 2019"}
