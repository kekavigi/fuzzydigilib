Several decades  of  important foundation-laying  work took  a social\nDarwinist  approach  and exhibited ecologically-deterministic elements. This is not the case for more  recent  developments  to the evolutionary  study  of  culture, which emphasize non-Darwinian processes\nsuch as self-organization, potentiality, and epigenetic change.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Cameron M.
