{"Nomor": 38282, "Judul": "Adventure in Topological Phase Transitions in 3 + 1-D: Non-Abelian Deconfined Quantum Criticalities and a Possible Duality", "Abstrak": "Continuous quantum phase transitions beyond the conventional paradigm of fluctuations of a\nsymmetry-breaking order parameter are challenging for theory. These phase transitions often involve\nemergent deconfined gauge fields at the critical points as demonstrated in phase transitions between\ndifferent broken-symmetry states of 2 + 1-dimensional quantum magnets, as well as those between\nsymmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. In this paper, we present several examples of deconfined\nquantum critical points between SPT phases in 3 + 1-D for both bosonic and fermionic systems. These\ncritical theories can be formulated as non-Abelian gauge theories either in the infrared-free regime or in\nthe conformal window when they flow to the Banks-Zaks fixed points. We explicitly demonstrate several\ninteresting quantum critical phenomena. We describe situations in which the same phase transition allows\nfor multiple universality classes controlled by distinct fixed points. We exhibit the possibility\u2014which we\ndub \u201cunnecessary quantum critical points\u201d\u2014of stable generic continuous phase transitions within the\nsame phase. We present examples of interaction-driven, band-theory-forbidden, continuous phase\ntransitions between two distinct band insulators. The understanding we develop leads us to suggest\nan interesting possible 3 + 1-D field theory duality between SU\u00f02\u00de gauge theory coupled to one massless adjoint Dirac fermion and the theory of a single massless Dirac fermion augmented by a decoupled topological field theory.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zhen Bi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["T.
