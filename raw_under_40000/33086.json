US politicians should take note.", "Abstrak": "When a rocket failure saw NASA\u2019s first carbon-monitoring satellite plunge into the ocean in 2009, it was a major blow for climate scientists. Space-based greenhouse-gas monitoring was a promising new frontier \u2014 and perhaps an eventual tool for monitoring international climate commitments. It took several years to\nget a replacement into space, but the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) began taking measurements in 2014. The first major scientific results were published last week in Science (see go.nature.com/2yr8n6a),\nand there can be no doubt that the mission is delivering. No doubts, either, that the US government should launch a successor.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "NATURE EDITOR [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Astronomi", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Sky", "Sumber": "19 OCTOBER 2017 | VOL 550 | NATURE | 301", "Staf Input/Edit": "pustaka bosscha", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Jan 2019"}
