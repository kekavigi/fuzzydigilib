{"Nomor": 35987, "Judul": "Azouracil and Its Cu(II)-Catalyzed Cyclization to an Anticancer ActiveTriazole Derivative: Symmetrical and Asymmetrical ReductiveCleavage, DNA Interaction, and Molecular Docking Studies", "Abstrak": "The 6-amino-1,3-dimethyl uracil-based azo derivative(p-carboxy phenylazouracil, L11)undergoes Cu(II)-catalyzedcyclization to a triazole derivative, namely, 1,3-dimethyl-8-(p-carboxy phenyl) azapurine (L11P). Interestingly, the azo function-ality of L11 undergoes both symmetrical and asymmetrical reductivecleavage at two different reaction conditions. The chloride salts ofMn(II), Ni(II), and Pd(II) catalyze reductive cleavage of an azomoiety in an asymmetric manner, producing a new uracil hydrazinederivative (A3). On the other hand, hydrazine catalyzes symmetricalreductive cleavage of the azo moiety of L11, resulting in 5,6-diamino-1,3-dimethyl uracil (A2) along with the startingp-aminobenzoic acid (A1). Time-dependent density functionaltheoretical (TD-DFT) studies provide optimized geometries ofL11, L11P, and A3 along with their orbital energies. The L11 and L11P bindfirmly to genomic DNA ofE. coliwith a site sizen?9 andn?8. The L11P shows anticancer activity on selected murine lymphoma cancer cell lines (DL, YAC1, and 2PK3). Inaddition, its antiproliferative activity is measured with several cancer cell lines and found hemocompatible toward blood cells.Corresponding molecular docking studies of L11P with caspase-3 (cysteine-aspartic proteases) unlock their mode of interaction.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Mahuya_Banerjee_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/161380"}, "Penulis": "Mahuya Banerjee [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sayantan Pradhan,Milan Ghosh,Jesu?s Sanmart\u00edn Matalobos, Abhinandan Rej,Sumit Kumar Hira,Debasis Das"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "azouracil, azapurine, reductive cleavage, DNA binding, anticancer activity, docking studies", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
