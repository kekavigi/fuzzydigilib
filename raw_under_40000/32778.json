{"Nomor": 32778, "Judul": "POTENSI OLEOKIMIA BIJI KENARI (Canarium indicum L) DAN HASIL MODULASI TRIGLISERIDANYA SEBAGAI ANTIDISLIPIDEMIA DAN PENGINDUKSI NEUROGENESIS", "Abstrak": "The health surveys in Indonesia showed tendency on increase of cause of death by\nnon-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular, hypertension, diabetes and\nstroke. Cardiovascular disease can be triggered either by the high level of\ncholesterol or lipid level in blood. Besides that, there is a close correlation between\nhypercholesterolemia and the incident rate of hypertension. Another problem is the\nincidence rate of diseases related to old age such as degenerative and\nneurodegenerative diseases which will increase in prevalence as the impact of\nincrease in life expentancy of Indonesian people at present. Even though it is stated\nthat at present, the highest population composition is of young people, there is also\nquite a large portion of elderly people based on the current Indonesian population\npyramid scheme. The consequence of the demographic change will be accompanied\nby the increase in demand for medicine and food which can act as a prevention as\nwell as treatment of a number of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s,\nParkinson and dementia. This type of disorder and diseases can cause distraction\nof cognitive function which results in a decrease in patient\u2019s quality of life.\nUp to the present, research on finding source of fatty acid especially essential fatty\nacid from plants and one that can give health benefit is still being conducted. In\ngeneral, essential fatty acid is found in vegetable oil in the form of triglyceride. A\nnumber of research results also indicated that unsaturated fatty acid plays quite an\nimportant role towards the prevention and treatment of several types of diseases,\namong others treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, atheroschlerosis, arthritis,\ninflammation, and as antihypercholesterolemia. Unsaturated fatty acid also has an\nimportant role for the function of brain development and to control the function of\nmembrane in the nervous system. The intake of unsaturated fatty acid either from\nMonounsaturated Fatty Acids or Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids can help slow down\ndecrease in cognitive function including learning and memory, both in animal and\nhuman.\nMeanwhile, in Indonesia, there is quite an abundance of vegetable oil resource and\nhas not been used maximally, one of which is vegetable oil derived from canary\nseeds. Canary tree from the species of Canarium indium L is a native of Indonesia\nv\nand until now has not been taken into account, but it actually has a potential to be\ndeveloped as medicine and food source. The oil content of canary seed is\napproximately 75% w/w thus canary seed has similarities with other tree nuts which\nhave prior been widely publicized, among others almond, cashew, walnut, Brazilnut\nand hazelnut.\nThis research was conducted to study the potentials of canary seed as source of raw\nmaterial in Indonesia to be developed as one of medicinal as well as food product.\nThe research strategy was conducted by doing modulation to improve the\ntriglyceride structure in canary oil. Several earlier researchers have reported use\nof various types of vegetable oil for the production of structured triglyceride, among\nothers from palm, olive, sesame, almond, and hazelnut oils. Until now, research\nreport on the use of canary oil for the production of structured triglyceride has not\nbeen found, thus this research is the first study on the use of canary oil from\nCanarium indicum L species for the raw material in the production of structured\ntriglyceride type M (medium)-L (long)-M (medium) or MLM.\nThe first stage of the research was to conduct extraction to obtain canary oil and\nfollowed by fatty acid composition analysis. The next stage was conducting\nmodulation on triglyceride structure in canary oil to improve the triglyceride\nstructure in order to improve the biochemical properties of triglyceride in canary\noil. The triglyceride modulation which was later called structured triglyceride, was\nconducted in two stages of enzymatic reaction namely ethanolysis and\nesterification. Both stages of reaction used lipase enzyme cathalyst from Mucor\nmiehei which has specific activity at position sn-1 and sn-3 from triglyceride\nstructure. Characterization to structured triglyceride product was conducted\nthrough determination of chemical number, thermal properties characterization,\nposition distribution analysis and fatty acid composition in structured triglyceride\nproduct. Next, product activity testing as antidislipidemia was done through blood\nlipid biochemical profile measuring and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor\n(BDNF) serum level measuring as a marker to determine the triglyceride product\nactivity as neurogenesis inducer.\nThe analysis of fatty acid composition in canary oil measured using High\nPerformance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) found composition of three highest\nfatty acid consecutively: oleic acid (51.71%), linoleic acid (32.40%) and palmitic\nacid (10.31%). The composition has similarities with the composition of oil from\nother types of tree nuts. Next, the regioselective analysis of fatty acid position\ndistribution in canary oil triglyceride showed composition of PUFAs at 93.96% at\nposition sn-2. This shows that canary oil can be used as raw material in structured\ntriglyceride production which can give physiological benefit to improve human\nhealth.\nThe result of ethanolysis reaction showed the highest yield of 2-monoacylglycerols\n(2-MAGs) at 10.40% w/w during reaction for six hours. This intermediate product\nwas then estherificated by incorporating caprylic acid (C8:0) as source of medium\nchain fatty acid (M) into the structure of 2-MAGs to further take the position of sn1 and sn-3 by lipase enzyme activity. After the incubation of three hours, as much\nas 45.36% caprylic acid was incorporated at position sn-1 and sn-3 in triglyceride\nvi\nstructure. The yield of estherification was 69.51% w/w. Result of structured\ntriglyceride product characterization showed that through triglyceride modulation\nin canary oil, improvement on physicochemistry quality has been done, among\nothers shown by range of product melting point (45.70-65.50 \u00b0C) which improved\nand decrease in canary oil triglyceride molecule weight from 961.71 g/mol into\n840.16 g/mol.\nStructured triglyceride product activity testing was conducted through blood\nbiochemical profile measuring showing that the product can decrease triglyceride\nlevel by 6.20%; can decrease blood cholesterol level by 4.40%; decrease level of\nLow Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (LDL-C) by 35.0% and increase level of High\nDensity Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (HDL-C) by 28.10% which was compared to\ndislipidemia rat group. For the activity testing as neurogenesis inducer, it showed\nthat the product was able to increase the serum level of BDNF by 21.69% compared\nto normal group test animal.", "Daftar File": {"2017_DS_PP_HAMIDAH_RAHMAN_1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/147206", "2017_DS_PP_HAMIDAH_RAHMAN_1-BAB_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/147207", "2017_DS_PP_HAMIDAH_RAHMAN_1-BAB_2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/147208", "2017_DS_PP_HAMIDAH_RAHMAN_1-BAB_3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/147209", "2017_DS_PP_HAMIDAH_RAHMAN_1-BAB_4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/147210", "2017_DS_PP_HAMIDAH_RAHMAN_1-BAB_5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/147211", "2017_DS_PP_HAMIDAH_RAHMAN_1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/147212"}, "Penulis": "Hamidah Rahman [30712003]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Tutus Gusdinar Kartawinata, MS", "Prof. Ir.
