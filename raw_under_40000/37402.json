{"Nomor": 37402, "Judul": "Genuine 12-Qubit Entanglement on a Superconducting Quantum Processor", "Abstrak": "We report the preparation and verification of a genuine 12-qubit entanglement in a superconducting\nprocessor. The processor that we designed and fabricated has qubits lying on a 1Dchain with relaxation times ranging from 29.6 to 54.6 ?s. The fidelity of the 12-qubit entanglement was measured to be above\n0.5544  0.0025, exceeding the genuine multipartite entanglement threshold by 21 statistical standard\ndeviations. After thermal cycling, the 12-qubit state fidelity was further improved to be above 0.707  0.008.\nOur entangling circuit to generate linear cluster states is depth invariant in the number of qubits and uses\nsingle- and double-qubit gates instead of collective interactions. Our results are a substantial step towards\nlarge-scale random circuit sampling and scalable measurement-based quantum computing.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ming Gong [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ming-Cheng Chen,", "Yarui Zheng,", "Shiyu Wang,", "Chen Zha,", "Hui Deng,", "Zhiguang Yan,", "Hao Rong,", "Yulin Wu,", "Shaowei Li,", "Fusheng Chen,", "Youwei Zhao,", "Futian Liang,", "Jin Lin,", "Yu Xu,", "Cheng Guo,", "Lihua Sun,", "Anthony D.
