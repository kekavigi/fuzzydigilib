{"Nomor": 34253, "Judul": "Risk Measurement Of International Oil And Gas Projects Based On The Value At Risk Method", "Abstrak": "International oil and gas projects feature high capital-intensity, high risks and contract diversity. Therefore, in order to help\ndecision makers make more reasonable decisions under uncertainty, it is necessary to measure the risks of international oil\nand gas projects. For this purpose, this paper constructs a probabilistic model that is based on the traditional economic\nevaluation model, and introduces value at risk (VaR) which is a valuable risk measure tool in finance, and applies VaR to\nmeasure the risks of royalty contracts, production share contracts and service contracts of an international oil and gas\nproject. Besides, this paper compares the influences of different risk factors on the net present value (NPV) of the project\nby using the simulation results. The results indicate: (1) risks have great impacts on the project\u2019s NPV, therefore, if risks\nare overlooked, the decision may be wrong. (2) A simulation method is applied to simulate the stochastic distribution of\nrisk factors in the probabilistic model. Therefore, the probability is related to the project\u2019s NPV, overcoming the inherent\nlimitation of the traditional economic evaluation method. (3) VaR is a straightforward risk measure tool, and can be applied\nto evaluate the risks of international oil and gas projects. It is helpful for decision making.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "CHENG CHENG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zhen Wang", "Ming-Ming Liu", "Xiao-Hang Ren"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Risk measurement, Value at risk, International oil and gas projects, Fiscal terms, Probabilistic model", "Sumber": "Petroleum Science (2019) 16:199\u2013216 https://doi.org/10.1007/s12182-018-0279-1", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Feb 2019"}
