{"Nomor": 34293, "Judul": "Microalgae biomass from swine wastewater and its conversion to bioenergy", "Abstrak": "Ever-increasing swine wastewater (SW) has become a serious environmental concern. High levels of nutrients\nand toxic contaminants in SW significantly impact on the ecosystem and public health. On the other hand, swine\nwastewater is considered as valuable water and nutrient source for microalgae cultivation. The potential for\nconverting the nutrients from SW into valuable biomass and then generating bioenergy from it has drawn increasing attention. For this reason, this review comprehensively discussed the biomass production, SW treatment\nefficiencies, and bioenergy generation potentials through cultivating microalgae in SW. Microalgae species grow\nwell in SW with large amounts of biomass being produced, despite the impact of various parameters (e.g.,\nnutrients and toxicants levels, cultivation conditions, and bacteria in SW). Pollutants in SW can effectively be\nremoved by harvesting microalgae from SW, and the harvested microalgae biomass elicits high potential for\nconversion to valuable bioenergy.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "D.L.
