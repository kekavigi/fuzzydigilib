{"Nomor": 33061, "Judul": "Effect of offset-jets arrangement on leading edge hot-air heating effectiveness of engine inlet guide strut", "Abstrak": "An experimental investigation is conducted to study the effect of offset-jets arrangement on the conjugated\nheat transfer performance for a specifically wedge-shaped concave surface subjected to external\ncold flow and internal hot jet impingement. The external flow Reynolds number (Rec) defined on the base\nwidth of wedge-shaped concave surface is fixed as 54,000. The jet Reynolds number (Rej) is varied in the\nrange of 7900\u201331,700. Four non-dimensional jet-hole offset distances (L/d) ranging from 0 to 2.5 and four\nnon-dimensional jet-to-leading edge distances (H/d) ranging from 6 to 15 are considered respectively. In\norder to illustrate the effect of offset-jets arrangement on the flow and heat transfer features inside the\nwedge-shaped concave cavity, numerical simulations are also performed. The results show that the\noffset-jets arrangement generally has a significant impact on improving the overall heating effectiveness\nin the vicinity of concave wall leading edge due to the reduction of normal jet impinging distance and the\nformation of recirculation flow structure inside the concave cavity. In current study, L/d = 1.5 is confirmed\nto be a superior offset-jets arrangement for achieving the highest specified area-averaged heating effectiveness.\nIt is also noted that the effect of offset-jets arrangement on the leading edge hot-air heating\neffectiveness is tightly dependent on the normal jet-to-leading edge distance. Under H/d = 15, the\noffset-jets distance has a weak effect of on the internal hot-jet impingement heat transfer. In this situation,\nthe offset-jets arrangement has nearly no effect on improving the hot-jet heating effectiveness.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Tao Guan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jing-zhou Zhang , Yong Shan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Conjugated heat transfer, Confined jet impingement, Wedge-shaped concave surface, Offset-jets arrangement, Heating effectiveness", "Sumber": "Science Direct", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Jan 2019"}
