{"Nomor": 35619, "Judul": "Investigation Of The Degradation And Stability Of Acrylamide-Based Polymers In Acid Solution: Functional Monomer Modified Polyacrylamide", "Abstrak": "Acrylamide copolymers are often used as acidizing diverting and thickening agents for their advantageous thickening, flocculation, adhesion and resistance reduction properties. Experimental\nresults indicate that the acid concentration greatly affects the properties of acrylamide polymers,\nwhich varies from results reported by other researchers. Considering the theoretical and field\napplication value of the present study, four comparable acrylamide-based polymers were synthesized, and their macro- and micro-changes as well as the related changes in viscosity and molecular\nweight were studied in high-concentration hydrochloric acid. A proposed mechanism of acrylamide\ncopolymer stability and degradation is provided, and further suggestions are made for the modification of acrylamide copolymers.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yuxin Pei  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Liqiang Zhao", "Guangyan Du", "Nianyin Li", "Kun Xu", "Hanjie Yang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Acrylamide-based polymer, Acidizing, Degradation, Stability, Thickening", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 4, Pages 399-407 (December 2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Feb 2019"}
