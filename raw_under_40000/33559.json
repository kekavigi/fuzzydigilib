{"Nomor": 33559, "Judul": "Diffusive Heat Waves in Random Conformal Field Theory", "Abstrak": "We propose and study a conformal field theory (CFT) model with random position-dependent velocity that, as we argue, naturally emerges as an effective description of heat transport in one-dimensional quantum many-body systems with certain static random impurities. We present exact analytical results that elucidate how purely ballistic heat waves in standard CFT can acquire normal and anomalous diffusive contributionsduetoourimpurities.Ourresultsincludeimpurity-averagedGreen\u2019sfunctionsdescribing the time evolution of the energy density and the heat current, and an explicit formula for the thermal conductivity that, in addition to a universal Drude peak, has a nontrivial real regular contribution that depends on details of the impurities.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Edwin Langmann [langmann@kth.se ]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Per Moosavi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Physics", "Kata Kunci": "Conformal field theory.
