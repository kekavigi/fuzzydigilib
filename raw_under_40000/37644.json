{"Nomor": 37644, "Judul": "Nanoscale Atomic Density Microscopy", "Abstrak": "Quantum simulations with ultracold atoms typically create atomic wave functions with structures at\noptical length scales, where direct imaging suffers from the diffraction limit. In analogy to advances in\noptical microscopy for biological applications, we use a nonlinear atomic response to surpass the\ndiffraction limit. Exploiting quantum interference, we demonstrate imaging with superresolution of ?=50\nand excellent temporal resolution of 500 ns. We characterize our microscope\u2019s performance by measuring\nthe ensemble-averaged probability density of atoms within the unit cells of an optical lattice and observe\nthe dynamics of atoms excited into motion. This approach can be readily applied to image any atomic or\nmolecular system, as long as it hosts a three-level system.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "S.
