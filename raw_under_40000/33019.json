{"Nomor": 33019, "Judul": "The star that would not die", "Abstrak": "When a star that has more than about eight times the mass of the Sun dies, it either collapses to a\nblack hole or explodes as a supernova1. In the latter case, a blast at the centre of the star \u2014usually caused by the formation of a stellar remnant called a neutron star \u2014 ejects the surrounding material at high speed. The expansion of this material releases trapped energy, providing a nearly constant luminosity\n(equivalent to that of about 100 million Suns) for roughly 100 days, before fading. Supernovae\nlasting more than 130 days are extremely rare2.\nOn page 210, Arcavi et al.3 report that a supernova known as iPTF14hls glowed brilliantly for\nmore than 600 days, making it the longest-lived bright supernova ever observed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "STAN WOOSLEY [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Astronomi", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Astronomy", "Sumber": "9 NOVEMBER 2017 | VOL 551 | NATURE | 173", "Staf Input/Edit": "pustaka bosscha", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Jan 2019"}
