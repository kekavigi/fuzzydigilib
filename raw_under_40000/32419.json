Bioremediation is an effective\nprocess to remediate petroleum oil contaminant from the\necosystem. The aim of the present study was to reclaim a\npetroleum oil-contaminated soil which was unsuitable for the\ncultivation of crop plants by using petroleum oil hydrocarbondegrading\nmicrobial consortium.\nMaterials and methods Bacterial consortium consisting of\nBacillus subtilis DM-04 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa M and\nNM strains were seeded to 20% (v/w) petroleum oilcontaminated\nsoil, and bioremediation experiment was carried\nout for 180 days under laboratory condition. The kinetics of\nhydrocarbon degradation was analyzed using biochemical\nand gas chromatographic (GC) techniques. The ecotoxicity of\nthe elutriates obtained from petroleum oil-contaminated soil\nbefore and post-treatment with microbial consortium was\ntested on germination and growth of Bengal gram (Cicer\naretinum) and green gram (Phaseolus mungo) seeds.\nResults Bacterial consortium showed a significant reduction\nin total petroleum hydrocarbon level in contaminated soil\n(76% degradation) as compared to the control soil (3.6%\ndegradation) 180 days post-inoculation. The GC analysis\nconfirmed that bacterial consortium was more effective in\ndegrading the alkane fraction compared to aromatic fraction\nof crude petroleum oil hydrocarbons in soil. The nitrogen,\nsulfur, and oxygen compounds fraction was least degraded.\nThe reclaimed soil supported the germination and growth of\ncrop plants (C. aretinum and P. mungo). In contrast, seeds\ncould not be germinated in petroleum oil-contaminated soil.\nConclusions The present study reinforces the application of\nbacterial consortium rather than individual bacterium for\nthe effective bioremediation and reclamation of soil\ncontaminated with petroleum oil.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ASHIS K.
