{"Nomor": 38963, "Judul": "Effects of Melanin on Optical Behavior of Polymer: From Natural Pigment to Materials Applications", "Abstrak": "Melanin is a kind of ubiquitous natural pigment, which\nserves a variety of protective functions in many organisms. In the present\nstudy, natural melanin and synthetic melanin nanoparticles (NPs) were\nsystematically investigated for its potential application in polymeric\noptical materials. A significant short-wavelength shielding and high\nvisible light transparency polymer nanocomposite was easily obtained via\ntuning the melanin particle size. In particular, the nanocomposite film\nwith melanin NPs (diameter ? 15 nm) loading even as low as 1 wt %\nblocks most ultraviolet light below 340 nm and still keeps high visible\nlight transparency (83%) in the visible spectrum. More importantly,\nbecause of the excellent photoprotection and radical scavenging\ncapabilities of melanin, the resulting polymer nanocomposite exhibits\noutstanding photostability. In effect, such fantastic melanin NPs is\npromising for applications in various optical materials.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Yang Wang 1.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170702"}, "Penulis": "Yang Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xuefei Wang, Ting Li, Piming Ma, Shengwen Zhang, Mingliang Du, Weifu Dong, Yi Xie, and Mingqing Chen"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "melanin, polymer, UV-shielding, transparency, photostability", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
