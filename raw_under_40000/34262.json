{"Nomor": 34262, "Judul": "Integrated 3D facies modeling of the Mangahewa Formation, Maui Gas Field, Taranaki Basin, New Zealand", "Abstrak": "3D seismic data, well logs, core-based lithofacies and photographs have been combined to interpret and model the depositional facies of the Mangahewa Formation of the Maui Gas Field, Taranaki Basin, New Zealand. The primary objective of\nthe study is to generate a robust facies model for the Middle to Late Eocene (47\u201337 Ma) Mangahewa Formation of the feld.\nThe facies model has included eighteen depositional facies spatially distributed over the gas feld. These facies are further\nsubgrouped into three broad depositional facies associations, namely marginal marine, shallow marine and ofshore environment. We have identifed that marginal marine is the most dominant facies association (64%) within the model. The model\nvisualizes estuarine and shoreface sand geobodies dominating over other facies within the model. Both geobodies comprise\nover 40% of all the facies interpreted in the feld. The entire modeling process involves a novel stochastic approach using\nunique workfow that follows 3D gridding, coding of the facies classes and multiple iterations over the interpreted facies.\nThe model therefore realistically visualizes potential facies responsible for \u201cgood\u201d-quality reservoir sands in the Mangahewa\nFormation with possible retrogradation from older to younger succession.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "A.
