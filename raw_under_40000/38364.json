{"Nomor": 38364, "Judul": "Neighborhood Street Layout and Property Value: The Interaction of Accessibility and Land Use Mix", "Abstrak": "This paper evaluates how consumers value differences in neighborhood composition and street layout, factors not previously included in empirical studies of house value. Highly connected street patterns are important to New Urbanism. We use measures of neighborhood street connectivity and their interaction with other neighborhood attributes to evaluate how street layout affects property values. We employ two different methods of indexing street layout. Both methods show layout has a significant impact on price, but  onclusions are sensitive to the method used. In pedestrian oriented neighborhoods, a more gridiron-like street pattern increases house value using one measure, but greater connectivity decreases house value using\nthe other. In auto-oriented developments, a more gridiron-like street pattern reduces house value using either measure.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "John W.
