{"Nomor": 35041, "Judul": "Potentiometric diclofenac detection in wastewater using functionalized nanoparticles", "Abstrak": "Ion selective electrodes for diclofenac monitoring in both pharmaceutical wastewater and dosage form were\ndescribed; that are considered environmental friendly analytical method. The sensors development depended on\ncomparative performance evaluation of membranes that were based on functionalized magnetite nanoparticles\nwith the classical sensors; this approach provided that nanoparticles in the inner solution of sensor membrane\nwere highly dispersed and coated with ionophore to enhance a complete ion-pairing interaction between the\nionophore and the analyte. The optimum membrane was that containing ??cyclodextrin coupled with magnetite\nferric oxide as inner filling solution, dibutylphthalate as plasticizer and crystal violet as ion exchanger in poly\n(vinylchloride) matrix. This sensor (CV-Fe-?-CD) exhibited high sensitivity, Nernstian slope of the calibration\ncurve, as well as fast, stable response and good selectivity. The sensor exhibits a Nernstian slope of\n?58.7 \u00b1 1 mV/decade over the concentration range 1.0 \u00d7 10?7 to 1.0 \u00d7 10?2 M of Diclofenac with a minimal\nlimit of detection of 1.1 \u00d7 10?7 M. The electrode showed a good potentiometric selectivity for diclofenac with\nrespect to a number of interfering ions and organic species. The membrane sensor was successfully applied for\nthe determination of diclofenac in wastewater samples and dosage form without sample pretreatment steps prior\nto its analysis.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Heba T.
