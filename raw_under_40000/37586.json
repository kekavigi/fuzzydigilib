Three-dimensional numerical simulation of the\nthermo-mechanical coupling behaviors in a nuclear fuel rod is carried out, and the evolution rules\nof the important thermal and mechanical variables are obtained and analyzed. The research re-\nsults indicate that: (1) the fuel pellets will be in contact with the cladding at high burnup, which\nwill induce a strong mechanical interaction between them; (2) the irradiation creep effect plays\nan important role in the mechanical behavior evolution in the nuclear fuel rod.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xin Gong [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yijie Jiang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "irradiation hardening, irradiation creep, large-deformation, thermo-mechanical coupling, FEM", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Apr 2019"}
