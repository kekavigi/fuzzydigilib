{"Nomor": 36208, "Judul": "The Optimal Model Of Oilfield Development Investment Based On Data Envelopment Analysis", "Abstrak": "The investment problem of oilfield development is to trade off the investment exploration investment and development investment. With low return on investment got by using the existing\nmethod to solve this problem, we construct an optimal model to improve it based on Data\nEnvelopment Analysis (DEA) method and the relations about investment and proven reserves,\ninvestment and output as well as production cost. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method is\nused to present a method to determine the optimal scale of productivity construction investment in\nunit production. The relation between total cumulated proven reserves and cumulative exploration\ninvestment is denoted as an exponential model. The relation among productions and remaining\nrecoverable reserves as well as production cost may be described as an exponential operational cost\nfunction. Based on above two relation models and investment effectiveness coefficients of every\nblock, we establish an optimal model whose objective function is net present value (NPV) profit\nmaximum, whose constrain conditions include investment, reserve/production ratio, production\nand some equality constraints under the mode of sustainable development. It can be solved by\ngenetic algorithms. The result of case study shows that this optimal investment of oilfield development has multi-stage investment structure under given conditions; the model can provide scientific basic theory for oil companies to make a long-term strategic program and investment plan\nin oil exploration and development, may decrease the subjective blindness in the investment and\nbring about a reasonable and orderly exploration and development of oil resources.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yihua Zhong [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jiao Zhao"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Data envelopment analysis, Oilfield development, Investment optimization, Reserves and productions", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 3, Pages 307-312 (September  2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Mar 2019"}
