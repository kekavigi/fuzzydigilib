{"Nomor": 36000, "Judul": "Capability assessment and challenges for quantum technology gravity sensors for near surface terrestrial geophysical surveying", "Abstrak": "Geophysical surveying is widely used for the location of subsurface features. Current technology is limited in\nterms of its resolution (thus size of features it can detect) and penetration depth and a suitable technique is needed\nto bridge the gap between shallow near surface investigation using techniques such as EMconductivity mapping\nand GPR commonly used to map the upper 5 m below ground surface, and large features at greater depths\ndetectable using conventional microgravity (N~5mbelowground surface). This will minimise the risks from unknown\nfeatures buried in and conditions of the ground during civil engineeringwork. Quantum technology (QT)\ngravity sensors potentially offer a step-change in technology for locating featureswhich lie outside of the currently\ndetectable range in terms of size and depth, but that potential is currently unknown as field instruments have\nnot been developed. To overcome this, a novel computer simulation was developed for a large range of different\ntargets of interest. The simulation included realistic noise modelling of instrumental, environmental and location\nsources of noise which limit the accuracy of current microgravity measurements, in order to assess the potential\ncapability of the new QT instruments in realistic situations and determine some of the likely limitations on their\nimplementation.\nThe results of the simulations for near surface features showed that the newtechnology is best employed in a gradiometer\nconfiguration as opposed to the traditional single sensor gravimeter used by current instruments due to\nthe ability to suppress vibrational environmental noise effects due to common mode rejection between the sensors.\nA significant improvement in detection capability of 1.5\u20132 times was observed, putting targets such as\nmineshafts into the detectability zone which would be a major advantage for subsurface surveying. Thus this research,\nfor the first time, has demonstrated clearly the benefits of QT gravity gradiometer sensors thereby increasing\nindustry's confidence in this new technology.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Daniel Boddice [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Nicole Metje, George Tuckwell"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Quantum gravity Gravity gradiometer Computer simulation Civil engineering", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 146 (2017) 149\u2013159, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.09.018", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Mar 2019"}
