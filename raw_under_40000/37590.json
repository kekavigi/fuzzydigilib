{"Nomor": 37590, "Judul": "Materials by Design: Tailored Morphology and Structures of CarbonAnodes for Enhanced Battery Safety", "Abstrak": "Next-generation Li-ion battery technologyawaits materials that not only store more electrochemicalenergy atfinite rates but also exhibit superior control over sidereactions and better thermal stability. Herein, we hypothesizethat designing an appropriate particle morphology can providea well-balanced set of physicochemical interactions. Given theanode-centric nature of primary degradation modes, weinvestigate three different carbon particles?commercialgraphite, spherical carbon, and spiky carbon?and analyzethe correlation between particle geometry and functionality.Intercalation dynamics, side reaction rates, self-heating, andthermal abuse behavior have been studied. It is revealed that the spherical particle outperforms an irregular one (commercialgraphite) under thermal abuse conditions, as it eliminates unstructured inhomogeneities. A spiky particle with orderedprotrusions exhibits smaller intercalation resistance and attenuated side reactions, thus outlining the benefits of controlledstochasticity. Suchfindings emphasize the importance of tailoring particle morphology to proffer selectivity among multimodalinteractions", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Ryan_A__Adams_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/165025"}, "Penulis": "Ryan A.
