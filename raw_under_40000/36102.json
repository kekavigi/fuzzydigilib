{"Nomor": 36102, "Judul": "Porous Silicon Carrier Delivery System for Curcumin: Preparation,Characterization, and Cytotoxicity in Vitro", "Abstrak": "A novel carrier delivery system for curcumin basedon porous silicon (pSi) has been developed. The pSifilm wasprepared by electrochemical etching method and the micro-particles of pSi were obtained by ultrasonication. The pSifilm andparticles of pSi were characterized by scanning electronmicroscopy (SEM). Sodium nitrite can induce curcumin into pSiand improve the drug loading (DL) and encapsulation efficiency(EE) of curcumin in double-distilled water loading buffer solution.Curcumin on the pSi surface was confirmed by Fourier transforminfrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and UV-spectroscopy. The optimalloading conditions of curcumin in pSi are investigated. Thecurcumin in pSi keeps more than 95% bioactivity for 3 h and good repeatability. The cumulative release ratio of curcumin fromPSi can reach 35% after 10 h. The in vitro cytotoxicity of curcumin loaded pSi was evaluated with HT-29 and NCM460 celllines. The pSi delivery carrier can provide a controlled release and efficacy system for curcumin.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Qingxia_Lin_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/161604"}, "Penulis": "Qingxia Lin [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wei Li,Di Liu,Mengyuan Zhao,Xuerui Zhu,Weiwei Li,Longfeng Wang,Tiesong Zheng,Jianlin Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "curcumin, porous silicon, encapsulation, release, cytotoxicity evaluation", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
