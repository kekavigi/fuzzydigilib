{"Nomor": 37840, "Judul": "NONLINEAR DYNAMICS AND SYNCHRONIZATION OFTWO COUPLED PIPES CONVEYING PULSATING FLUID", "Abstrak": "In this paper, the nonlinear dynamical behavior of two coupled pipes conveying\npulsating fluid is studied. The connection between the two pipes is considered as a distributed\nlinear spring. Based on this consideration, the equations of motion of the coupled two-pipe system\nare obtained. The two coupled nonlinear partial differential equations, discretized using the fourthorder\nGalerkin method, are solved by a fourth-order Runge-Kutta integration algorithm. Results\nshow that the connection stiffness has a significant effect on the dynamical behavior of the coupled\nsystem. It is found that for some parameter values the motion types of the two pipes might be\nsynchronous.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Qiao Ni  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zilong Zhang, Lin Wang, Qin Qian, Min Tang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "pipe conveying pulsating fluid, nonlinear dynamics, coupled two-pipe system, synchronization", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Apr 2019"}
