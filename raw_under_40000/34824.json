{"Nomor": 34824, "Judul": "Verification Of Two-Dimensional LBM-DEM Coupling Approach And Its Application In Modeling Episodic Sand Production In Borehole", "Abstrak": "The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is implemented in the Particle Flow Code (PFC) as a pore-scale\nCFD module and coupled with the particulate discrete element assemblage in PFC using an\nimmersed boundary scheme. The implementation of LBM and LBM-PFC coupling is validated with\nthe analytical solutions in a couple of hydrodynamics and fluid-particle interaction problems, i.e.,\nthe accuracy of LBM as a CFD solver is verified by solving channel flow driven by a pressure gradient\nfor which the closed-form solution is also derived; the accuracy of LBM-PFC coupling is validated by\nsolving flow across a cylinder, Taylor-Couette flow, K\narman vortex street, and  fluid flow through a\ncylinder array. To demonstrate potential applications of this coupling code, a perforation cavity\nsubjected to axial fluid flush is then tested, showing that the collapse and reconstruction of sand\narch in the perforation cavity can be reproduced in this coupling system. The developed system is\nready for exploring more complicated physical issues involved in sand production.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yanhui Han  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Peter Cundall"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Lattice Boltzmann method, Distinct element method, Pore-scale fluid flow, Fluidesolid interaction, Perforation cavity", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 3, Issue 2, Pages 179-189 (December 2017)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Feb 2019"}
