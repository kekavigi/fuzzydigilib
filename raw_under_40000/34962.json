By\ncoupling RED to Reverse Osmosis (RO) for seawater desalination: (1) sustainable energy is produced in\nthe RED process and (2) seawater is partially desalinated prior to RO thus, decreasing the energy\ndemand. In this study, secondary-treated wastewater is proposed as the low salinity source in RED and\nsuitable pre-treatment techniques for this effluent are investigated. Although it is generally accepted\nthat RED is less prone to fouling than typical pressure driven membrane processes, results showed that\npre-treatment is a key to ensure efficient operation of the wastewater-seawater RED. Both 100 \u00b5m\nfiltration and rapid sand filtration proved to be suitable, with an increase in pressure drop of only 0.09-\n0.18 bar and a permselectivity decrease of only approximately 20% during 40 days of continuous operation. Conversely, River bank filtration did not perform better than the non-pretreated sample. As\nsuch, 100 \u00b5m filtration and rapid sand filtration are considered suitable, robust, and cost efficient pretreatment options for wastewater fed RED, enabling the improvement of the hybrid process of RED-RO\nseawater desalination.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "M.
