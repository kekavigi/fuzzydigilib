{"Nomor": 34178, "Judul": "Behavioral explanation for risk taking in Islamic and conventional banks", "Abstrak": "The objective of this paper is to provide a behavioral explanation for risk taking in Islamic and\nconventional banks. Within the prospect theory framework; we consider the bias of loss aversion\nand mental accounting to explain the risk behavior in Islamic and conventional banks in the MENA region. We use the Fishburn's (1977) risk measure and the Kendall\u2019s t to test the prospect theory predictions. Several measures of performance and risk are used as target level. The results\nfor the two types of banks are too similar and provided evidence for Fishburn's (1977) risk\nmeasure and Tversky and Kahneman's (1992) cumulative prospect theory. Banks above the target\nlevel tend to show risk aversion behavior, while the banks listed below tend to be risk-oriented.\nThis finding provides evidence for the loss aversion bias and mental accounting.", "Daftar File": {"2018_EJRNL_INES_BEN_SALAH_MAHDI_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/155050"}, "Penulis": "Ines Ben Salah Mahdi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mouna Boujelb\u00e8ne Abbes"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Aktuaria", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Insurance", "Kata Kunci": "Islamic banks, Risk, Prospect theory, Loss aversion, Mental accounting", "Sumber": "Research in International Business and Finance 45 (2018) 577\u2013587", "Staf Input/Edit": "Dwi Ary Fuziastuti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Feb 2019"}
