However, little is known about how electrospun\nfi\nber diameter in\nfl\nuences astrocyte behavior. In this work,\naligned\nfi\nbers with two distinct nanoscale\nfi\nber diameters (808\nand 386 nm) were prepared, and the astrocyte response was\nmeasured over time. Astrocytes on the large diameter\nfi\nbers\nshowed signi\nfi\ncantly increased elongation as early as 2 h after\nseeding and remained signi\nfi\ncantly more elongated for up to 4\ndays compared to those on small diameter\nfi\nbers. Astrocytes\nextending along larger diameter\nfi\nbers were better equipped to\nsupport long neurite outgrowth from dorsal root ganglia\nneurons, and neurite outgrowth along these astrocytes was less\nbranched than outgrowth along astrocytes cultured on small\ndiameter\nfi\nbers. The di\nff\nerences in astrocyte shape observed on the small or large diameter\nfi\nbers did not translate into\ndi\nff\nerences in GLT-1, GFAP, or GLAST protein expression. Thus, di\nff\nerent\nfi\nber diameters were unable to in\nfl\nuence astrocyte\nprotein expression uniquely. Nevertheless, astrocytes cultured in either small or large\nfi\nbers signi\nfi\ncantly increased their\nexpression of GLT-1 compared to astrocytes cultured on non\nfi\nber (\nfi\nlm) controls. Fibrous-induced increases in astrocyte GLT-1\nexpression protected astrocyte/neuron cocultures from toxicity generated by high extracellular glutamate. Alternatively,\nastrocytes/neurons cultured on\nfi\nlms were less able to protect these cells from culture conditions consisting of high glutamate\nlevels. Biomaterials, such as the\nfi\nbrous materials presented here, may help stimulate astrocytes to increase GLT-1 expression\nand uptake more glutamate, since astrocytes are less likely to uptake glutamate in neurodegenerative pathologies or following\ncentral nervous system injury.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Christopher D.
