{"Nomor": 34475, "Judul": "Local Design and Development: A space for coordination  between design, craft and territory", "Abstrak": "The creation of the Centro Metropolitano de Dise\u00f1o (Design Metropolitan  Center)  was  the  resolution  emerging  from  a  strategy and a methodological search which allowed to contact the design  and  its  main  actors  with  the  new  context  phenomena  which appeared by the end of the 90s in Argentina, such as the social  crisis,  unemployment,  the  devaluation  and  subsequent  revaluation  of  national  production,  the  industry  collapse  and  recovery, the exponential growth in the number of design pro-\nfessionals, the emergence of new entrepreneurs, etcetera. Several  experiences,  programs  and activities  have  been  developed  during the 10 years of this institution and, perhaps, the greatest \ncontribution  has  been  to  clearly  propose  an  agenda  linking  design  activities  to  local development  strategies  in  the  City  of  Buenos  Aires,  through  a  systemic  model  which  covered  each  of  its  initiatives.  Hence,  recurrent  and  many  times  irreductible  conflicts  concerning  apparently  antagonistic  positions,  which  are  usually  frequent  in  academic  and  professional  debates  of  the  Latin  American  design  world,  were  channeled  from  practices  exceeding  reductionisms  and  diving  into  the  complexity  brought  by  the  work  with  multiple  actors  who  are  part  of  a  project settled in the territory. This work explores, based on one of the projects carried out by the CMD and other particular ex-periences still in progress, the outstanding aspects observed in a process of mutual transfer between craftsmen and designers located in different territories: one being an urban and compact territory,  and  the  other  being  the  vast  puna  of  the  Argentine  \nNorthwest. Likewise, it intends to mention the multiplicity of actors and factors operating in the design-craft relation as part of a  local  development  system,  which  contains  and  conditions  it.  \nFinally,  some  methodological  recommendations  are  proposed  to advance in the design of programs which allow to articulate these two universes.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Adrian Lebendiker [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "design, craft, local development, territory, research.", "Sumber": "Strategic Design Research Journal, 4(2): 33-39 May-August 2011", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Feb 2019"}
