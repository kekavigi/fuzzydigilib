{"Nomor": 32987, "Judul": "DEFORMATION AND FLOW OF AMORPHOUS SOLIDS: INSIGHTS FROM ELASTOPLASTIC MODELS", "Abstrak": "The deformation and flow of disordered solids, such as metallic glasses and concentrated emulsions,\ninvolves swift localized rearrangements of particles that induce a long-range deformation field. To\ndescribe these heterogeneous processes, elastoplastic models handle the material as a collection of\n\u201cmesoscopic\u201d blocks alternating between an elastic behavior and plastic relaxation, when they are\nloaded above a threshold. Plastic relaxation events redistribute stresses in the system in a very\nanisotropic way. A review is given of not only the physical insight provided by these models into\npractical issues such as strain localization, creep, and steady-state rheology, but also the fundamental\nquestions that they address with respect to criticality at the yielding point and the statistics of avalanches\nof plastic events. Furthermore, connections are discussed with concurrent mean-field approaches and\nwith related problems such as the plasticity of crystals and the depinning of an elastic line.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ALEXANDRE NICOLAS [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["EZEQUIEL E.
