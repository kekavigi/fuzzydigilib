{"Nomor": 32548, "Judul": "Fa\ufffd\ufffdade Design Stages: Issues and Considerations", "Abstrak": "Building fa\u00e7ades play an important role in building aesthetics and in protecting the structural system and contents from deterioration\ndue to exposure to an aggressive environment. Well-designed fa\u00e7ades can also help improve the durability and energy efficiency of the\nbuilding as well as elevating the level of human comfort. In general, fa\u00e7ade design and detailing have not received the same level of rigor and\noverall scrutiny as the load-bearing components of buildings. Current codes and standards require safety provisions for environmental separating\nelements of a building. However, there is an urgent need for the development of detailed procedures for the design of durable and sustainable\nbuilding fa\u00e7ades. This paper reviews the needed considerations in each stage of an optimal fa\u00e7ade life cycle and compares them with the\ncurrent available practices and discusses various safety-related issues, failure modes, and the risks involved throughout the system service life.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SAVIZ MOGHTADERNEJAD [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["M.
