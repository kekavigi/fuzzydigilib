{"Nomor": 33805, "Judul": "Polyacrylamide Hydrogel Application In Sand Control With Compressive Strength Testing", "Abstrak": "Sand production is one of the major problems in sandstone reservoirs. Different mechanical and chemical methods have\nbeen proposed to control sand production. In this paper, we propose a chemical method based on using polyacrylamide/\nchromium triacetate hydrogel to investigate sand production in a synthetic sandpack system. To this end, a series of bulk\nexperiments including the bottle test and rheological analysis along with compression tests were conducted. Experimental\nresults indicated that the compressive strength of the sandpack was increased as much as 30 times by injecting 0.5 pore\nvolume of hydrogel. Also, it was found that the increases in cross-linker and polymer concentrations exhibited a positive\nimpact on the compressive strength of the sandpack, mostly by cross-linker concentration (48 psi). Hydrogel with a higher\nvalue of cross-linker could retain its viscoelastic properties against the strain which was a maximum of 122% for 0.5\nweight ratio of cross-linker/polymer. The presence of salts, in particular divalent cations, has a detrimental effect on the\nhydrogel stability. The maximum strain value applied on hydrogel in the presence of CaCl2 was only about 201% as\ncompared to 1010% in the presence of distilled water. Finally, thermogravimetric analysis and its derivative showed that\nthe hydrogel could retain its structure up to 300 C. The results of this study revealed the potential application of the\nhydrogel to control sand production.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MAHSA BAGHBAN SALEHI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Asefe Mousavi Moghadam", "Samira Zargari Marandi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Sand control, Rheology, Hydrogel strength, Compressive strength, Sandpack", "Sumber": "Petroleum Science (2019) 16:94\u2013104 https://doi.org/10.1007/s12182-018-0255-9", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Jan 2019"}
