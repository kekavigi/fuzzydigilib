{"Nomor": 33188, "Judul": "Application of magnetic and gravity methods to the exploration of sodium sulfate deposits, case study: Garmab mine, Semnan, Iran", "Abstrak": "This study investigates the feasibility of using potential field (magnetic and gravity) data for geophysical exploration\nof sodium sulfate (salt-cake) resources; more specifically glauberite (sodium sulfate) and Eugsterite\n(sodium calcium sulfate) are two prevalent minerals of the Garmab mine in Semnan province, Iran.\nThe geophysical data were collected on several profiles perpendicular to geological structures of the area and the\nresidual magnetic and gravity maps were generated. Based on the magnetic susceptibility and density measurements\nof ore and waste samples, the areas identified by lowmagnetic and high gravity anomalieswere associated\nwith high potential zones for glauberite mineralization.\nThree-dimensional inversion of potential field data was applied to the residual data, leading to a\npetrophysical model of the magnetic susceptibility and density contrast of sought salt rocks. We found\nthat the ore bodies could be successfully characterized by low-susceptibility and high-density. In this\npaper, the susceptibility and density models from inversion are consistent with the geological and drilling\ndata. Results of the integrated application of magnetic and gravity data can be used to delineate sodium\nsulfate prospects as well.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ahmad Afshar [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Gholam-Hossain Norouzi, Ali Moradzadeh, Mohammad-Ali Riahi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Sodium sulfate Glauberite Magnetic Gravity Inversion", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 159 (2018) 586\u2013596, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.10.003", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Jan 2019"}
