{"Nomor": 37983, "Judul": "Toward Connectionist Model For Predicting Bubble Point Pressure Of Crude Oils: Application Of Artificial Intelligence", "Abstrak": "Knowledge about reservoir fluid properties such as bubble point pressure (Pb) plays a vital role in\nimproving reliability of oil reservoir simulation. In this work, hybrid of swarm intelligence and\nartificial neural network (ANN) as a robust and effective method was executed to determine the Pb\nof crude oil samples. In addition, the exactly precise Pb data samples reported in the literatures\nwere employed to create and validate the PSO-ANN model. To prove and depict the reliability of the\nsmart model developed in this study for estimating Pb of crude oils, the conventional approaches\nwere applied on the same data set. Based on the results generated by PSO-ANN model and other\nconventional methods and equation of states (EOS), the PSO-ANN model is a reliable and accurate\napproach for estimating Pb of crude oils. This is certified by high value of correlation coefficient (R2\n)\nand insignificant value of average absolute relative deviation (AARD%) which are obtained from\nPSO-ANN outputs. Outcomes of this study could help reservoir engineers to have better understanding of reservoir fluid behavior in absence of reliable and experimental data samples.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MOHAMMAD ALI AHMADI  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Maysam Pournik", "Seyed Reza Shadizadeh"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Bubble point pressure, Swarm intelligence, Crude oil, Artificial intelligence, Reservoir fluid", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 4, Pages 307-317 (December  2015)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Mei 2019"}
