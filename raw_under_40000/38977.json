{"Nomor": 38977, "Judul": "Photoresponsive Self-Healing Polymer Composite with Photoabsorbing Hybrid Microcapsules", "Abstrak": "Microcapsule-based self-healing polymer materials are highly\ndesirable because they can heal large-volume cracks without changing the original\nchemical structures of polymers. However, they are limited by processing\ndifficulties and inhomogeneous distributions of two components. Herein, we\nreport a one-component photoresponsive self-healing polymer composite with\nphotoabsorbing hybrid microcapsules (PAHM), which gives the microcapsules\nphotoabsorbing properties by introducing nano-TiO2 particles as photoabsorbing\nand emulsified agents in the poly(urea-formaldehyde)/TiO2 hybrid shells. Upon\nmechanical damage and then exposure to light, the photoresponsive healing agents\nin the cracks will be solidified to allow for self-healing, while the healing agents in\nthe unbroken PAHM will be protected and remain unreacted, which endows this\nphotoresponsive microcapsule-based self-healing composite with self-healing\nproperties like those found in the conventional two-component microcapsulebased systems. Given the universality of this hybrid polymerization method, incorporation of the photoabsorbing particles to\nconventional polymer shells may further broaden the scope of applications of these widely used materials.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Lei Gao 1.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170731"}, "Penulis": "Jinliang He [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jun Hu, Chao Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "photoresponsive, self-healing, photoabsorbing, microcapsule, coating", "Sumber": "www.acsami.org DOI: 10.1021/acsami.5b09121 ACS Appl.
