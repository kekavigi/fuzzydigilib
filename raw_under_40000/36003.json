{"Nomor": 36003, "Judul": "A practical method for estimatingmaximumshearmodulus of cemented sands using unconfined compressive strength", "Abstrak": "The composition of naturally cemented deposits is very complicated; thus, estimating themaximumshearmodulus\n(Gmax, or shear modulus at very small strains) of cemented sands using the previous empirical formulas is very difficult.\nThe purpose of this experimental investigation is to evaluate the effects of particle size and cement type on the\nGmax and unconfined compressive strength (qucs) of cemented sands, with the ultimate goal of estimating Gmax of\ncemented sands using qucs. Two sandswere artificially cemented using Portland cement or gypsum under varying\ncement contents (2%\u20139%) and relative densities (30%\u201380%). Unconfined compression tests and bender element\ntests were performed, and the results from previous studies of two cemented sands were incorporated in this\nstudy. The results of this study demonstrate that the effect of particle size on the qucs and Gmax of four cemented\nsands is insignificant, and the variation of qucs and Gmax can be captured by the ratio between volume of void and\nvolume of cement. qucs and Gmax of sand cemented with Portland cement are greater than those of sand cemented\nwith gypsum. However, the relationship between qucs and Gmax of the cemented sand is not affected by the void\nratio, cement type and cement content, revealing that Gmax of the complex naturally cemented soils with unknown\nin-situ void ratio, cement type and cement content can be estimated using qucs.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hyunwook Choo [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hongyeop Namb, Woojin Lee"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Cemented sand Portland cement Gypsum Maximum shear modulus Unconfined compressive strength Particle size", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 147 (2017) 102\u2013108, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.10.012", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Mar 2019"}
