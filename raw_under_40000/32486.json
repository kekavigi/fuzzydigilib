{"Nomor": 32486, "Judul": "Environment management in the hotel industry: does institutional environment matter?", "Abstrak": "Limited theoretical attention has been paid to understand the underlying drivers of hotels\u2019 engagement in environment\nmanagement (EM). By using institutional theory, this study provides an integrated model that captures\nvarious social drivers of hotels\u2019 engagement in EM. The associations between the three dimensions of\ninstitutional environment and hotel environmental practices were empirically tested, as well as the moderating\nrole of hotel characteristics. A total of 414 usable surveys representing 414 hotels were collected from hotel\nmanagers in China. The results demonstrate positive associations of hotel EM practices with supportive state\nregulations, shared industry standards, competitors\u2019 EM practices and expectations from various stakeholders\nsuch as employees, local community, and investors. Particularity, the strength of positive relationships between\nspecific institutional pressures vary across hotel sizes and scales. Theoretical and practical implications are\ndiscussed", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zhe Ouyang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wei Wei., Christina G.
