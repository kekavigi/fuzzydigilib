{"Nomor": 38454, "Judul": "Fabrication of Metallic Nanomesh: Pt Nano-Mesh as a Proof of Concept for Stretchable and Transparent Electrodes", "Abstrak": ": Two-dimensional ordered arrays of honeycomb\nmorphology of platinum are fabricated by using anodized\naluminum oxide template and metal sputtering methods. The\nresulting metal films are highly conductible (71 ?/sq),\nstretchable (16.8%), and transparent (75.2% at 550 nm).\nThe presented synthetic strategy is scalable to large area\nwithout noticeable defects by incorporating the deposition of a\nthin layer of silver. In addition, both the pore size and wall\nthickness of platinum nanomesh films are straightforwardly controlled with sputtering time. As a proof of concept, the metal\nnanomesh films using AAO template suggest a new concept of synthesizing transparent and stretchable metal electrodes for\nfuture electronic devices.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Ho Young Jang 1.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/169737"}, "Penulis": "Ho Young Jang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["\u2020 Seoung-Ki Lee,Sang Hyun Cho,Jong-Hyun Ahn,  Sungho Park"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "nanomesh, AAO, stretchable electrode, transparent electrode, honeycomb", "Sumber": "pubs.acs.org/cm", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Mei 2019"}
