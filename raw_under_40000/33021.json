{"Nomor": 33021, "Judul": "Analytical Models & Type-Curve Matching Techniques For Reservoir Characterization Using Wellbore Storage Dominated Flow Regime", "Abstrak": "The applicability of early time data in reservoir characterization is not always considered worthy. Early\ntime data is usually controlled by wellbore storage effect. This effect may last for pseudo-radial flow or\neven boundary dominated flow. Eliminating this effect is an option for restoring real data. Using the data\nwith this effect is another option that could be used successfully for reservoir characterization.\nThis paper introduces new techniques for restoring disrupted data by wellbore storage at early time\nproduction. The proposed techniques are applicable for reservoirs depleted by horizontal wells and\nhydraulic fractures. Several analytical models describe early time data, controlled by wellbore storage\neffect, have been generated for both horizontal wells and horizontal wells intersecting multiple hydraulic\nfractures. The relationships of the peak points (humps) with the pressure, pressure derivative and\nproduction time have been mathematically formulated in this study for different wellbore storage coefficients. For horizontal wells, a complete set of type curves has been included for different wellbore\nlengths, skin factors and wellbore storage coefficients. Another complete set of type curves has been\nestablished for fractured formations based on the number of hydraulic fractures, spacing between\nfractures, and wellbore storage coefficient.\nThe study has shown that early radial flow for short to moderate horizontal wells is the most affected\nby wellbore storage while for long horizontal wells; early linear flow is the most affected flow regime by\nwellbore storage effect. The study has also emphasized the applicability of early time data for characterizing the formations even though they could be controlled by wellbore storage effect. As a matter of\nfact, this paper has found out that wellbore storage dominated flow could have remarkable relationships\nwith the other flow regimes might be developed during the entire production times. These relationships\ncan be used to properly describe the formations and quantify some of their characteristics", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SALAM AL-RBEAWI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Reservoir engineering, Reservoir modeling and simulation, Pressure transient analysis, Reservoir characterization, Wellbore storage effect, Skin factor, Reservoir flow regimes, Pressure behaviors", "Sumber": "Petroleum 4 (2018) 223-239 - KeAi, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2017.09.001", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Jan 2019"}
