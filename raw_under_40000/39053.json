{"Nomor": 39053, "Judul": "Enhancing the Thermal Conductance of Polymer and Sapphire Interface via SelfAssembled Monolayer", "Abstrak": "Interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) receives\nenormous consideration because of its significance in determining\nthermal performance of hybrid materials, such as polymer based\nnanocomposites. In this study, the ITC between sapphire and\npolystyrene (PS) was systematically investigated by time domain\nthermoreflectance (TDTR) method. Silane based self-assembled\nmonolayers (SAMs) with varying end groups, -NH2, -Cl, -SH and\n-H, were introduced into sapphire/PS interface, and their effects\non ITC were investigated. The ITC was found to be enhanced up\nby a factor of 7 through functionalizing the sapphire surface with\nSAM, which ends with a chloride group (-Cl). The results show\nthat the enhancement of the thermal transport across the SAMfunctionalized interface comes from both strong covalent bonding between sapphire and silane-based SAM, and the high\ncompatibility between the SAM and PS. Among the SAMs studied in this work, we found that the ITC almost linearly\ndepends on solubility parameters, which could be the dominant factor influencing on the ITC compared with wettability\nand adhesion. The SAMs serve as an intermediate layer that bridges the sapphire and PS. Such a feature can be applied to\nceramic-polymer immiscible interfaces by functionalizing the ceramic surface with molecules that are miscible with the\npolymer materials. This research provides guidance on the design of critical-heat transfer materials such as composites and\nnanofluids for thermal management.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Kun Zheng 1.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170915"}, "Penulis": "Kun Zheng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Fangyuan Sun, Jie Zhu,Yongmei Ma,Xiaobo L, Dawei Tang, Fosong Wang, Xiaojia Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "interfacial thermal conductance, solubility parameter, organic?inorganic interface, miscibility, time domain thermoreflectance", "Sumber": "www.acsnano.org  DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.6b03381 ACS Nano 2016, 10, 7792?7798", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Jun 2019"}
