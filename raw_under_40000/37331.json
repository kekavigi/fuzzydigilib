Though\nthe use of parametric models has got wider in urban design, the\ncritical reflection on the actual and possible application of the\nmethod in urbanism has fallen limited so far. The paper tends to\nrelate parametric design with the contemporary understanding of\nurbanism with regards to the idea of design control in the the context\nof complexity. From this perspective, the actual performance of the\nmodel application in urban context is discussed with the renowned\nproject of Kartal-Pendik Masterplan (Zaha Hadid Architects) in Istanbul,\nTurkey.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Olgu \u00c7aliskan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Parametric design; urban design; generative urbanism; design control and planning", "Sumber": "Planning Practice & Research, 2017 VOL. 32, NO. 4, 417\u2013443 https://doi.org/10.1080/02697459.2017.1378862", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur \u00a0\n                                     Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Mar 2019"}
