The domain flexing function c (H) is\nused to replace the domain flexing constant c in one-dimension coupled hysteresis model. The feasibility\nand rationality of proposed modification are convinced by comparing the magnetization\nand magnetostriction curves with experimental data and another typical modification results. The\neffects of pre-stress and temperature on magnetic-elastic-thermal coupling property and hysteresis\nbehavior are investigated.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yongfei Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Youhe Zhou"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "coupled hysteresis model, domain flexing function, negative susceptibility, inner loop", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Apr 2019"}
