{"Nomor": 35303, "Judul": "Frequency analysis of multi-sources acoustic emission from high-velocity waterjet rock drilling and its indicator to drilling efficiency", "Abstrak": "Acoustic emission has been recognized as a potentially advanced technique to monitor the efficiency of highvelocity waterjet rock drilling. Identification of AE multi-sources signals becomes fundamental to correlate AE\nsingles and rock drilling efficiency. This paper presents a controlled experimental scheme and frequency analysis\nto identify different signal sources from waterjet impact and rock failure, respectively. Acoustic signals were\ndecomposed into low, medium, and high-frequency signals by using the variational mode decomposition (VMD)\napproach. Results indicate that the waterjet impact generates a wideband acoustic signal. The frequency distribution of the high-frequency signals exhibited a strong diversity among four materials because of their different acoustic attenuation. Furthermore, the waterjet pressure did not change the frequency domain distribution of the material. An obvious reduction of the high-frequency signals was observed while waterjet rock\ndrilling. Furthermore, the main frequency of high-frequency signals starts to be time-dependent that causes from\nthe rock failure process. The high-frequency band presented a good correlation with the rate of penetration.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mao Sheng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Shouceng Tian, Bo Zhang, Hongkui Ge"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Acoustic emission, Waterjet, Rock failure", "Sumber": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrmms.2019.01.005", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani \u00a0\n                                     Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Feb 2019"}
