{"Nomor": 37851, "Judul": "Art within analysis: scapegoat, transference and transformation", "Abstrak": "Through clinical example and pictorial illustration, the author examines ways in which art offers a particular means of psychological transformation in states which may otherwise be inexpressible. A transference to the art work itself is proposed. It issubmitted  that,  mediated  within  the  transference/  countertransference  dynamic,  this\u2018scapegoat transference\u2019 facilitates a particular process of psychological differentiation.The aesthetic qualities of art presented within analysis will resonate with other counter-transference affects. Clinical material demonstrates how observation of this \u2013 \u2018aesthetic\ncountertransference\u2019  \u2013  leads  to  a  distinction  between  the  \u2018diagrammatic\u2019  and  the  \u2018embodied\u2019  image.  The  process  of  integration  of  shadow  material  is  furthered  by  the temporary safe-keeping of the art work by the analyst.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Joy Schaverien [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "aesthetic, art, embodiment, countertransference, Jung, Cassirer, scapegoat, symbol, transference, Winnicott.", "Sumber": "Journal of Analytical Psychology ,  1999 ,  44 ,  479\u2013510", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Apr 2019"}
