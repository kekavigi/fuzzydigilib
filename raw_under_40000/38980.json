{"Nomor": 38980, "Judul": "IMPLEMENTASI MANAJEMEN RESIKO PADA PROYEK-PROYEK KONSTRUKSI: STUDI KASUS DI PT PANTRAYA", "Abstrak": "PT Pantraya is a company engaged in construction since 1999, whose main business is in construction of buildings and infrastructure. PT Pantraya has successfully worked on five to six construction building projects annually in the area around Sumatra, Java and Bali. A construction project that includes many parties sometimes often occurs problems and also arises various risks. The risks that occur often have a detrimental impact on the company. This study aims to identify major risks that have a negative impact on the final outcome of a project and the negative impact on the company significantly. In addition, the study intends to implement risk management in PT Pantraya's projects five years back, in order to provide recommendations related to the implementation of risk management in future construction projects. By using qualitative methodology, it is hoped that this research can provide benefits to the company. The primary data used comes from the results of interviews with the parties involved in the PT Pantraya project. Based on the analysis of the nine respondents who have been interviewed, it can be concluded that the heaviest risks are inaccurate calculations, uncoordinated designs (structure, mechanics and electricity), unavailable materials and equipment, financial failures of contractor, design changes, lack of consistency between bill of quantities, design and specifications, delayed payments from clients, poor human resources, natural disasters and accidents due to poor safety procedures. To avoid these major risks, the study suggests risk adaptation strategies and risk prevention strategies. As for recommendations for future projects, companies can use the checklist method, a simple risk assessment model and a standard risk assessment model.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Marsha Nadianaputri": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170734"}, "Penulis": "Marsha Nadianaputri [29316052]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
