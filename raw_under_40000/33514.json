{"Nomor": 33514, "Judul": "Could Shale Gas Meet Energy Deficit: Its Current Status And Future Prospects", "Abstrak": "The production of gas from conventional\nreserves has shown steep decline, whereas the demand of\nhydrocarbons as energy source is rising. Hence, the\nresulting deficit of energy can be met by developing the\nunconventional energy resources. Among all unconventional energy resources, shale gas is relatively the potential\nsource of energy to be developed in a sustainable way.\nHowever, the degree of uncertainty is large for sustainable\ndevelopment of shale gas reservoirs. The shale gas found is\nheld in extremely low-permeability formations having poor\nporosity; the free gas and the adsorbed gas are also found\ntogether. Therefore, the production mechanisms of shale\ngas reservoirs are quiet complex than the conventional gas\nreservoirs. Hence, the shale gas resources sustainable\ndevelopment remain ambiguous. In order to find sustainable way of exploitation of shale gas resources, this\nmanuscript reviews in detail, the shale gas potential in\nPakistan and the world in terms of its distribution, production mechanism, policy implications and development\ntrends.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ABDUL MAJEED SHAR [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Aftab Ahmed Mahesar, Khalil Rehman Memon"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Shale gas, Sustainable development, Hydraulic fracturing, Status and challenges, Future", "Sumber": "Journal of petroleum exploration and production technology, Volume 8, Issue 4, December 2018, https://doi.org/10.1007/s13202-017-0399-y", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Jan 2019"}
