{"Nomor": 33159, "Judul": "Using mussel as a global bioindicator of coastal microplastic pollution *", "Abstrak": "The ubiquity and high bioavailability of microplastics have an unknown risk on the marine environment.\nBiomonitoring should be used to investigate biotic impacts of microplastic exposure. While many studies\nhave used mussels as indicators for marine microplastic pollution, a robust and clear justification for\ntheir selection as indicator species is still lacking. Here, we review published literature from field investigations and laboratory experiments on microplastics in mussels and critically discuss the suitability\nand challenges of mussels as bioindicator for microplastic pollution. Mussels are suitable bioindicator for\nmicroplastic pollution because of their wide distribution, vital ecological niches, susceptibility to\nmicroplastic uptake and close connection with marine predators and human health. Field investigations\nhighlight a wide occurrence of microplastics in mussels from all over the world, yet their abundance\nvaries enormously. Problematically, these studies are not comparable due to the lack of a standardized\napproach, as well as temporal and spatial variability. Interestingly, microplastic abundance in fieldcollected mussels is closely related to human activity, and there is evidence for a positive and quantitative correlation between microplastics in mussels and surrounding waters. Laboratory studies collectively demonstrate that mussels may be good model organisms in revealing microplastic uptake,\naccumulation and toxicity. Consequently, we propose the use of mussels as target species to monitor\nmicroplastics and call for a uniform, efficient and economical approach that is suitable for a future largescale monitoring program.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jiana L [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": [", Amy L.
