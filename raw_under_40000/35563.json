{"Nomor": 35563, "Judul": "Effective evaluation of pressure relief drilling for reducing rock bursts and its application in underground coal mines", "Abstrak": "Rock bursts are an extreme behaviour in coal mine strata that can cause fatalities and severe economic losses.\nPressure relief drilling is a widely used method in coal mines to release high stress concentrations and effectively\nreduce the rock mass volumetric elastic potential energy; thus, this method can effectively reduce the occurrence\nof rock bursts in underground coal mines. Based on actual geologic conditions in the area of a rock burst that\noccurred in the Yangcheng Mine, a series of experimental studies on mechanical properties are conducted using\ngypsum-type coal-like materials with different numbers and configurations of pressure relief boreholes. The\nchange in parameters, such as the strength and energy dissipation index of bored coal-like materials under a\nuniaxial compression, is studied, and the fracture propagation characteristics in the rock surrounding the\nboreholes in the experiments are analysed. FRACOD, which is a numerical code that predicts the explicit fracturing process in rocks using fracture mechanical principles, is then used to simulate the laboratory tests, and the\nnumerical results are compared with the experimental results. The code is also used to study the relief effect of\nthree boreholes with different geometrical configurations; thus, local fracture initiation and propagation around\nthe boreholes are investigated. Combined with the characteristics of the stress change in the rock surrounding\nthe boreholes, the optimal configurations of the pressure relief boreholes for the Yangcheng coal mine are\ndetermined. The results have shown that the larger the drilling density is, the more the rock fracture development around the boreholes, the greater the energy release and, hence, the more effective the relief effect. Finally,\nthis study presents a new methodology for choosing the optimal layout parameters for pressure relief drilling,\nwhich could aid future research in related fields.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Shichuan Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yangyang Li, Baotang Shen, Xizhen Sun, Liqun Gao"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Rock burst, Pressure relief borehole, Borehole configuration, Fracture initiation and propagation, Effective evaluation, Coal-like material", "Sumber": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrmms.2018.12.010", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Feb 2019"}
