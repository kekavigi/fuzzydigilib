{"Nomor": 33121, "Judul": "The importance of seismic methods application for geological reconstruction of rockslide threatened open pit", "Abstrak": "The significance of otherwise not frequently applied seismic methods in area of open pits increases by occurrence\nof unpredictable phenomena threatening the deposit during mining operation. Recognizing natural hazards as\nrockslide, its arrangement and examination of its formation may prevent the otherwise negative impact on economy\nof the mining and the mining safety. In this paper synthetic methodological approach including application\nof seismic refraction, seismic tomography, ground vibration monitoring and geological documentation in dolomite\nopen pit Kra?ovany-Rieka (Western Carpathians, Slovakia), where large rockslide covering area of 96,952\nm2 (\u0160imekov\u00e1 et al., 2013) evolved, is presented. Four 138m long profiles were measured using Terraloc Mk8\n24 channel seismograph with 10 Hz vertical geophones and geophone offset 6 m and processed by ReflexW\nSandmeier scientific software. Seismic velocities and frequencies were during two blasts measured by threechannelled\nseismographs -UVS 1504, Vibraloc and VMS 2000MP seismograph at four fixed standpoints to derive\nthe ground transmission coefficient K, referring about the changes of the physical characteristics of the rock environment\n(Bongiovanni et al., 1991). Geological documentation included mapping and description of the basic\nlithological units. Results of the methods were integrated into the finalmodel constructedby the Petrelmodeling\nsoftware. The case study revealed complicated geological-structural composition of the areawith basement from\ngranodiorites passing upward into thick-bedded carbonates, which are locally covered by Quaternary deposits.\nPrimary factor influencing the rockslide triggering by steep inclination of the basement and faults formation is\ntectonics. Dense spatial distribution of two fault systems caused a segmentation of the carbonates into several,\nindependently moving blocks. Further agents weakening the rock mass stability were climatic conditions and additional\nmining activity contributing to gravity driven independent movement of blocks. Seismic refraction and\nseismic tomography proved as valuable method for geological and structural reconstructions of the open pit\nand rockslide that are necessary preconditions for the rockslide movement prediction and suggestions of the\neffective landslide control.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Kondela J [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prekopov\u00e1 M., Budinsk\u00fd V., Pandula B., ?uri\u0161ka I"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Seismic refraction Rockslide Tectonics Open pit Western Carpathians", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 159 (2018) 304\u2013311, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.09.005", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Jan 2019"}
