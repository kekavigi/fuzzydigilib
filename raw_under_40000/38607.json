{"Nomor": 38607, "Judul": "Cluster-Assembled Materials: Toward Nanomaterials with Precise Control over Properties", "Abstrak": "One pathway toward nanomaterials with controllable band gaps is to assemble solids where\natomic clusters serve as building blocks, since the electronic structures of clusters vary with size and composition.\nTo study the role of organization in cluster assemblies, we synthesized multiple architectures incorporating As7\n3\nclusters through control of the countercations. Optical measurements revealed that the band gaps vary from\n1.12.1 eV, even though the assemblies are constructed from the identical cluster building block. Theoretical\nstudies explain this variation as being a result of altering the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital levels by\nchanging the countercations. Additional variations in the gap are made by covalently linking the clusters with\nspecies of varying electronegativity to alter the degree of charge transfer. These findings offer a general protocol\nfor syntheses of nanoassemblies with tunable electronic properties", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Meichun Qian 1.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170040"}, "Penulis": "Meichun Qian [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Arthur C.
