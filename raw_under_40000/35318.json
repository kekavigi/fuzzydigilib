{"Nomor": 35318, "Judul": "Q-estimation using seismic interferometry from vertical well data", "Abstrak": "The Green's function between two receivers can be retrieved using seismic interferometry (SI) by crosscorrelation, as if one of the receivers were a virtual seismic source. When the wavefields experience intrinsic\nlosses during propagation, non-physical arrivals (ghosts) would appear in the retrieved result. These ghosts\nare a result of internal reflections inside the different layers lying between the subsurface sources and the receivers. Recent studies have introduced a stable method to monitor the layer-specific changes in quality factor\n(Q) using the ghosts retrieved by SI applied to a horizontal-well data. However, drilling a horizontal well is\nmuch more complicated and expensive than drilling a conventional vertical well. Because of this, we show\nhere how the Q-estimation method introduced for the horizontal well can be adapted to monitor layer-specific\nchanges of Q using a vertical well. In order to improve the accuracy of the Q-estimation, we propose a gridsearching method to detect the optimal effective Q. We illustrate our method using numerically modelling\ndata from a horizontal and a vertical well.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Feng Cheng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Deyan Dragano, Jianghai Xia, Yue Hu, Jianhuan Liu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Seismic interferometry Intrinsic losses Quality factor Ghost reflection Vertical well Horizontal well Numerical modelling", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 159 (2018) 16\u201322, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.07.019", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Feb 2019"}
