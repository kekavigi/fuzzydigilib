{"Nomor": 38318, "Judul": "Design for all as a research   and education strategy", "Abstrak": "The biggest challenge for the education of designers lies in the fact that graduates will have to work in a context that is still in a process of definition. To meet this challenge, a collaborative and participatory strategy that develops two fundamental competences for the future is proposed: capacity to research and, therefore, to produce knowledge, and to meet needs other than the traditional ones. This strategy gathers three areas: Research developed by professors; Interaction between theory and practice of \nintegral design and universal design; Research and practice focused on the needs of people with disabilities. The specific objectives of this proposal are: to educate designers based on the perspective of research-action; to pay attention to human rights; to confront students with real situations; to encourage co-design between users and designers. Examples of designs developed by students in final projects are described.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Luis Rodr\u00edguez Morales [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Angelica Mart\u00ednez de la Pena"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Design for all, strategy, design education", "Sumber": "Strategic Design Research Journal, 11(3): 241-246, September-December 2018", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Mei 2019"}
