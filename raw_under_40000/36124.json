{"Nomor": 36124, "Judul": "An efficiently dynamic stress strain simulation method on digital rock", "Abstrak": "The dynamic stress strain simulation is one of the several digital rock physics methods that calculate elastic\nproperty of digital rocks. Simulations for calculating P- and S-wave property of one digital rock includes one\ncompressional simulation and three shear simulations.Moreover, the simulation frequencymust be lowenough\nto meet the long wavelength assumption. Hence, heavy computational burden is unavoidable. To improve the\ncomputational efficiency, in addition to parallel computation, one possible way is to optimize the boundary\ncondition applied on the digital rocks. The idea is to integrate the four kinds of boundary condition which\ncorrespond to the four separated simulations in the existed method into one boundary condition, accordingly\nthe number of simulation reduces to one. The computational efficiency of the new simulation method improves\napproximately four times, and the numerical accuracy is proved to be unaltered", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Wei Zhu  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Rui Shan, Ai-Lan Nie, Hao-Rui Peng"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Digital rock physics Dynamic stress strain simulation Boundary condition Elastic moduli", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 147 (2017) 10\u201315, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.10.008", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Mar 2019"}
