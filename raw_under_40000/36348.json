{"Nomor": 36348, "Judul": "Computational Organicism: Examining Evolutionary Design Strategies in Architecture", "Abstrak": "The diverse forms of nature, in particular and\nbiological forms, have long been a preoccupation of the\narchitect. As a special category of natural form, biological\norganisms exhibit extraordinary levels of design adaptability\nacross multiple generations based upon the inherent\n\u2018intelligence\u2019 of the evolutionary mechanism. Evolutionary\ndesign theory in architecture seeks to harness this generative\nintelligence as the foundation for a new architectural design\nprocess. This paper investigates the lineage of evolutionary\nthought in architectural design, paying particular attention to\nthe current trend towards experimentation with generative\nalgorithmic procedures and the theorization of an\nevolutionary architecture.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Brian Holland [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Architectural structure", "Kata Kunci": "design theory, historical era: modern and contemporary, algorithm, computer technology, morphology, Richard Dawkins, Manuel Delanda, William Latham, John Frazier", "Sumber": "Nexus Network Journal \u2013 Vol.12, No. 3, 2010 485", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Mar 2019"}
