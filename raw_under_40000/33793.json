In order to enhance our understanding of the\nprocess of formation of organic carbon up to 10%, optical, microscopy and geochemical methods have been used to\ninvestigate the petrographic and geochemical characteristics of the formation. Firstly, three mudstone lithofacies were\nidentified based on a wide variety of mudstone laminations. These are: (a) indistinctly laminated mudstone; (b) parallellaminated mudstone; and (c) nonparallel-laminated mudstone. Then, combining with the evidence from depocenter\nmigration, Th/U ratios and total organic carbon, the abundant organo-minerallic fabrics suggest that organic carbon was\npreferentially deposited and preserved in anoxic, low energy and stagnant water conditions during deposition of the\nWufeng and Longmaxi Formations. On the contrary, the Guanyinqiao Formation with poor organic carbon was deposited\nin oxic and high-energy water conditions.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "LEI YANG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Bo Ran", "Yu-Yue Han", "Shu-Gen Liu", "Yue-Hao Ye", "Christopher Xiao", "Wei Sun", "Di Yang", "Guo-Dong Xia", "Shi-Yu Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Guanyinqiao, Formation, Sichuan Basin, Mudstone, Laminated mudstone, Water condition", "Sumber": "Petroleum Science (2019) 16:44\u201357 https://doi.org/10.1007/s12182-018-0283-5(0123456789().,-volV)(0123456789().,-volV)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Jan 2019"}
