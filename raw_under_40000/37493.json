{"Nomor": 37493, "Judul": "Turbulence-Induced Rogue Waves in Kerr Resonators", "Abstrak": "Spontaneous emergence of self-organized patterns and their bifurcations towards a regime of complex\ndynamics in nonequilibrium dissipative systems is a paradigm of phase transition. Indeed, the behavior of\nthese patterns in the highly nonlinear regime remains less explored, even in recent high-quality-factor\nresonators such as Kerr-nonlinear optical ones. Here, we investigate theoretically and experimentally the\nalteration of the resulting Kerr frequency combs from the weakly to the highly nonlinear regime, in the\nframeworks of spatiotemporal chaos, and dissipative phase transitions.We reveal the existence of a striking\nand easily accessible scenario of spatiotemporal chaos, free of cavity solitons, in a monostable operating\nregime, wherein a transition to amplitude turbulence via spatiotemporal intermittency is evidenced.\nMoreover, statistics of the light bursts in the resulting turbulent regime unveils the existence of rogue waves\nas extreme events characterized by long-tail statistics.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Saliya Coulibaly [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Majid Taki.", "Abdelkrim Bendahmane,", "Guy Millot,", "Bertrand Kibler,", "and Marcel Gabriel Clerc"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW X 9, 011054 (2019); Published by the American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Mar 2019"}
