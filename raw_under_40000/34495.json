{"Nomor": 34495, "Judul": "Sumudu transform in fractal calculus", "Abstrak": "The C ?-Calculus includes functions on fractal sets, which are not differentiable or inte- grable using ordinary calculus. Sumudu transforms have an important role in control en- gineering problems because of preserving units, the scaling property of domains, easy vi- sualization, and transforming linear differential equations to algebraic equations that can be easily solved. Analogues of the Laplace and Sumudu transforms in C ?-Calculus are de- fined and the corresponding theorems are proved. The generalized Laplace and Sumudu transforms involve functions with totally disconnected fractal sets in the real line. Linear differential equations on Cantor-like sets are solved utilizing fractal Sumudu transforms. The results are summarized in tables and figures. Illustrative examples are solved to give more details.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_ALIREZA_K__GOLMANKHANEH_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/156406"}, "Penulis": "Alireza K.
