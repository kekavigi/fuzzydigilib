{"Nomor": 34618, "Judul": "A lab study of coupling effects of electromagnetic induction on underground utilities", "Abstrak": "Electromagnetic induction is the most common technique used for geophysical survey of\nunderground utilities, in planning stage, prior to construction/excavation and maintenance stage\nof projects. Despite its popularity and usefulness, its reliability and accuracy are nevertheless\nalways questionable due to coupling effects amongst the very congested underground utilities.\nThis work studies the disturbed electromagnetic field patterns caused by the coupling effect of\nneighbouring cables and metallic pipes via a series of validation experiments in PolyU\u2019s indoor\nunderground utility laboratory. The \u2018fingerprints\u2019 of electromagnetic fields are established\ncorresponding to different below ground conditions. 11 setups with 260 tests were designed to\nstudy the coupling effect between a cable and a pipe. The results show that the coupling effect is\nsignificant in the active detection of the cable. The experiment also compares the accuracies of\ncable and pipe detection at different induction frequencies with reference to the accuracy levels\nin the HK EMSD standard and PAS128:2014 British standard. This paper demonstrates the\nimportance of coupling effects in the detection of underground utilities, which should be\nconsidered in future revision of standards.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "K.L.
