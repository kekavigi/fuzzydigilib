{"Nomor": 33187, "Judul": "Numerical and theoretical simulations of the dielectric properties of porous rocks", "Abstrak": "Accurate determination of the dielectric properties of porous rocks is important for the dielectric exploration\nmethods in a range of applications from water resources to petroleum industry. Carefully controlled laboratory\nmeasurements offer the bestway of obtaining the dielectric behaviors but theywill require relatively large quantity\nof sample materials prepared in specific shapes, which is not always available. Numerical and theoretical\nsimulations compensate for this weakness and can compute the dielectric dispersion at the pore-scale level on\nsmall fragments of rocks. However, whether consistent dielectric results can be obtained from the numerical\ncomputation and from the properly developed theoretical models still needs investigation. We introduced in\nthis paper the numerical model based on the three-dimensional finite difference method (3D-FDM) and a\nrange of theoretical models on basis of interfacial polarization for the calculation of the frequency dependent\ndielectric properties in porous rocks of complex geometry. The numerical and theoretical models were applied\nto a hypothetical porous rock with ideal shaped grains and to a real synthetic sandstone sample with complex\npore and grain structure. Comparison of the simulation results from the two methods showed excellent agreement\nwith each other with squared correlation coefficients better than R2=0.98 for both relative permittivity\nand conductivity of the two example rocks. The consistent numerical and theoretical results provide a complementary\nway for the numerical and theoretical models to work together for a better simulation of the dielectric\nproperties of porous rocks.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Tongcheng Han [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Y.S.
