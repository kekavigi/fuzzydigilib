{"Nomor": 33049, "Judul": "Development of the natural environment scoring tool (NEST)", "Abstrak": "Natural environments (green and blue space) are associated with a range of health benefits, but their use is likely\nto be influenced by the presence of features, facilities and amenities and the condition/maintenance, or the\nnatural environment quality. Most \u2018quality\u2019 assessment tools have focused on green spaces and their support for\nphysical activity. This limits their utility for assessment of other natural environment typologies and uses (e.g.,\nsocial, relaxation). We aimed to develop a tool for feasible, in situ assessment of diverse natural environments\nthat might support a variety of uses, and to explore associations between natural environment quality and\nobjectively measured amount of natural environment and neighbourhood-level socio-economic status (SES).\nThis work was conducted as part of the PHENOTYPE project. Data were collected in 124 neighbourhoods in\nfour European cities (Barcelona, Doetinchem, Kaunas, Stoke-on-Trent). The Natural Environment Scoring Tool\n(NEST) was developed using existing tools, expert input and field-testing. The final tool comprised 47-items\nacross eight domains: Accessibility, Recreation facilities, Amenities, Aesthetics ? natural, Aesthetics \u2013 non-natural,\nSignificant natural features, Incivilities and Usability; typology-specific Overall Scores were derived.\nIn total, 174 natural environments, covering a range of typologies, were audited. Mean time to complete\nNEST was 16 \u00b1 28 min. There was good inter-rater agreement. Mean domain scores showed some expected\npatterns by typology (e.g., higher Recreation Facilities scores in urban parks and formal recreation areas; lower\nAmenities scores in natural/semi-natural areas). Highest mean Overall Scores were observed for areas of blue\nspace and woodland, the types of area that often lack the recreational facilities or amenities that can be\ndominant in physical activity-focused audit tools. There was a trend towards lower natural environment quality\nin neighbourhoods of lower SES, with some inter-city variation. Correlations between NEST scores and amount\nof natural environment indicated higher natural environment in areas with worse access. We recommend further\ntesting of NEST in other locations in relation to use and health outcomes.", "Daftar File": {"2018_EJRNL_PP_CHRISTOPHER_GIDLOW_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/149185"}, "Penulis": "Christopher Gidlowa [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Elise van Kempen.,Graham Smith., Margarita Triguero-Mas.,Hanneke Kruize.,Regina Gra\u017eulevi?ien?.,Naomi Ellis.,Gemma Hurst.,Daniel Masterson.,Marta Cirach.,, Magdalena van den Berg., Wim Smar.,Audrius D?del?., Jolanda Maas.,Mark J.
