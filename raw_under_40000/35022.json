{"Nomor": 35022, "Judul": "KAJIAN TEKNOLOGI LANDFILL MINING DALAM PENGEMBANGAN TPA (STUDI KASUS TPA LEUWIGAJAH PASCA LONGSOR)", "Abstrak": "Population lifestyle and activities especially in big cities are increasing based on\ntime. One of the consequences is waste problems. The increasing of waste generation is\none of the waste problems that often emerge in daily life. Waste generation has a linear\nrelationship with total population, so the increasing of population number and activities\nwill result in increasing of waste generation. The increasing of waste generation\nmotivates people to treat the waste. Dispose waste into final disposal site (FDS) is one of\nfinal steps in waste treatment.\nDevelopment of a FDS is done based on the quantity of waste, therefore it is related\nto the service period of FDS, the area, and the cost for the FDS management. The open\ndumping method of waste disposal in Indonesia is a method that can cause many\nproblems, it is also can cause landslide. With a short of service period, then a new area is\nneeded to make a new FDS. The problem is, it is difficult to find a new area. It needs big\ncost to make a new FDS and may promote a conflict with the community who disagree an\nFDS in their neighborhood, because of the odor, smoke, and flies disruption.\nThe concept of landfill mining technology is basically excavate and resources\nrecovery such as compost, daily cover soil, and recoverable material from closed landfill,\nso the service period can be prolonged and economic potential can be calculated. In this\nstudy, landfill mining technology is adapted for FDS in Indonesia which uses an open\ndumping method and as the case study is Leuwigajah Final Disposal after landslide.\nAfter land sliding, the waste that had covered will be opened, so it can be excavated\neasily. The resources potential such as compost, daily cover soil, and recovery material\nwill be determined by examining the physical and chemical characteristics. The\ncharacterization results show that there is around 52.5% potential of compost, and daily\ncover soil, 33% recoverable material, and 14.5% non-recoverable material as residue\nthen 1,743,593 m3 of FDS can be reused.", "Daftar File": {"2005_TA_PP_SHANTI_NATA_ARTHA_1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/158477", "2005_TA_PP_SHANTI_NATA_ARTHA_1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/158488"}, "Penulis": "SHANTI NATA ARTHA [15301034]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
