{"Nomor": 32435, "Judul": "Aluminium in brain tissue in autism", "Abstrak": "Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown aetiology. It is suggested to involve\nboth genetic susceptibility and environmental factors including in the latter environmental toxins. Human exposure\nto the environmental toxin aluminium has been linked, if tentatively, to autism spectrum disorder. Herein\nwe have used transversely heated graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry to measure, for the first time,\nthe aluminium content of brain tissue from donors with a diagnosis of autism. We have also used an aluminiumselective\nfluor to identify aluminium in brain tissue using fluorescence microscopy. The aluminium content of\nbrain tissue in autism was consistently high. The mean (standard deviation) aluminium content across all 5\nindividuals for each lobe were 3.82(5.42), 2.30(2.00), 2.79(4.05) and 3.82(5.17) ?g/g dry wt. for the occipital,\nfrontal, temporal and parietal lobes respectively. These are some of the highest values for aluminium in human\nbrain tissue yet recorded and one has to question why, for example, the aluminium content of the occipital lobe\nof a 15 year old boy would be 8.74 (11.59) ?g/g dry wt.? Aluminium-selective fluorescence microscopy was used\nto identify aluminium in brain tissue in 10 donors. While aluminium was imaged associated with neurones it\nappeared to be present intracellularly in microglia-like cells and other inflammatory non-neuronal cells in the\nmeninges, vasculature, grey and white matter. The pre-eminence of intracellular aluminium associated with nonneuronal\ncells was a standout observation in autism brain tissue and may offer clues as to both the origin of the\nbrain aluminium as well as a putative role in autism spectrum disorder.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Matthew Molda [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dorcas Umar", "Andrew King", "Christopher Exley"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Human exposure to aluminium Human brain tissue Autism spectrum disorder Transversely heated atomic absorption spectrometry Aluminium-selective fluorescence microscopy", "Sumber": "Journal of Trace Elements in Medicine and Biology 46 (2018) 76\u201382", "Staf Input/Edit": "ilham rahayu", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
