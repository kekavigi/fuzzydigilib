{"Nomor": 35632, "Judul": "SPECTROSCOPIC STUDY ON HOT-ELECTRON TRANSPORT IN A QUANTUM HALL EDGE CHANNEL", "Abstrak": "Hot electron transport in a quantum Hall edge channel of an AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure is studied by\ninvestigating the energy distribution function in the channel. Ballistic hot-electron transport, its optical-phonon replicas, weak electron-electron scattering, and electron-hole excitation in the Fermi sea are clearly identified in the energy spectra. The optical-phonon scattering is analyzed to evaluate the edge potential profile. We find that the electron-electron scattering is significantly suppressed with increasing the hot-electron\u2019s energy well above the Fermi energy. This can be understood with suppressed Coulomb potential with longer distance for higher energy. The results suggest that the relaxation can be suppressed further by softening the edge potential. This is essential for studying noninteracting chiral transport over a long distance.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "TOMOAKI OTA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["SHUNYA AKIYAMA,", "MASAYUKI HASHISAKA,", "KOJI MURAKI,", "AND TOSHIMASA FUJISAWA"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW B 99, 085310 (2019); \u00a92019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Feb 2019"}
