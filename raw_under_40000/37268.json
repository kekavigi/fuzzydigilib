{"Nomor": 37268, "Judul": "Integrated Optimization of Mixed Cargo Packing and Cargo Location Assignment in Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems", "Abstrak": "To improve the delivery efficiency of automated storage and retrieval system, the problem of the integrated optimization of mixed\ncargo packing and cargo location assignment is addressed. An integrated optimization model of mixed cargo packing and location\nassignments with the shortest time for the stacker in a certain historical period is established and is transformed into a conditional\npacking problem. An improved hybrid genetic algorithm based on a group coding method is designed to solve the problem.When\nthe initial population is generated, a new heuristic algorithm is designed to improve the convergence speed of the genetic algorithm\nconsidering the correlation and frequency of the goods outbound.Aheuristic algorithmfor a two-dimensional rectangular-packing\nproblem is designed to determinewhether a variety of goods can be mixed in packing. Taking actual data froman automated storage\nand retrieval system for an aviation food company as an example, the established model and design algorithm are verified and the\ninfluence of changes in the outbound delivery orders on the optimization result is analyzed. The results show that compared to the\nmethod of separate storage of goods based on cube-per-order index rules and a phased optimization method of mixed storage of\ngoods, an integrated optimization method of mixed cargo packing and location assignment can improve the outbound delivery\nefficiency of the stackingmachine by 11.43\u201325.98% and 1.73\u20135.51%, respectively, and reduce the cargo location used by 50\u201355% and\n0\u201310%, respectively.The stronger the correlation of the goods leaving a warehouse, the greater the potential of the design method\nin this paper to improve the efficiency of the stacker.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Bin Lei [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zhaoyuan Jiang and Haibo Mu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Integrated Optimization; Mixed Cargo Packing ; Cargo Location Assignment", "Sumber": "Hindawi Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society Volume 2019, Article ID 9072847, 16 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/9072847", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Mar 2019"}
