{"Nomor": 37599, "Judul": "Robotic collectives inspired by biological cells", "Abstrak": "In biological systems, large-scale behaviour can be achieved by the collective coupling and coordination of stochastically (randomly) moving small-scale components. For example, living cells aggregate and migrate collectively during the healing of wounds and when cancer spreads. Inspired by these biological mechanisms, on page 361, Li et al.1 report a collective robotic system in which deterministic locomotion is a result of the stochastic movement of many loosely coupled, disc-shaped components. The results show that stochasticity offers a promising approach to developing large-scale, collective robotic systems that exhibit robust deterministic behaviour.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "M E T I N S I T T I [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Bio-inspired robotic", "Sumber": "Nature", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Apr 2019"}
