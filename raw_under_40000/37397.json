{"Nomor": 37397, "Judul": "Space, time, connectivity and conflict in biological landscapes: the fourth special issue on spatial ecology", "Abstrak": "Spatial ecology and the spatial sciences in general are increasingly applied to support\nevidence-based policy and environmental management decisions in an era of global\nchange. The effects of global change agents \u2013 climate change, land-use change, novel\nspecies, and altered biogeochemical cycles and disturbance regimes \u2013 play out over\nmultiple spatial and temporal scales. International and multilateral agencies are calling\nfor spatially explicit information in support of policy and management supporting biodiversity,\necosystem services and sustainable environmental management. Conservation and\nenvironmental planning can no longer be restricted to a static landscape but must\nexplicitly account for temporal dynamics.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Shawn William Laffan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Andrew K.
