{"Nomor": 36347, "Judul": "Step-Up Thermoelectric Performance Realized in Bi2Te3AlloyedGeTe via Carrier Concentration and Microstructure Modulations", "Abstrak": "We report that outstanding thermoelectric perform-ances can be achieved in 7% Bi2Te3alloyed GeTe when it issimultaneously doped with iodine and treated with a waterquenching process. The introduction of moderate iodine can helpoptimize the electrical properties; moreover, a water quenchtreatment was found to induce a novel vacancy microstructure,i.e., Ge vacancy\u201cclusters\u201d, which helps to modulate the thermo-electric performance at higher temperatures. The successfulcombination of these two strategies eventually results in a peakfigure of merit ZT?2.2 at 723 K in water quenchedGe0.93Bi0.07Te1.005I0.03. This value is 2-fold of that in pristine GeTe(?1.1). Corresponding average ZT between 323 and 773 K is 1.23, in comparison with 0.44 for pristine GeTe. The calculatedsingle-leg device efficiency of water quenched Ge0.93Bi0.07Te1.005I0.03is?11.2% at a temperature gradient from 298 to 773 K,suggesting GeTe is a very promising thermoelectric at intermediate-temperature range.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Di_Wu_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/162057"}, "Penulis": "Di Wu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Lin Xie,Xiaolian Chao,Zupei Yang,Jiaqing He"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "thermoelectric, GeTe, microstructure modulation, ferroelectric domain, localized vacancy clusters, device efficiency", "Sumber": "ACSAppl.EnergyMater.XXXX, XXX, XXX?XXX", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Mar 2019"}
