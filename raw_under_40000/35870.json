{"Nomor": 35870, "Judul": "Electrochemical remediation of chicken processing plant wastewater", "Abstrak": "Chicken Processing Plant (CPP) produces a large amount of wastewater containing a variety of readily biodegradable organic compounds, carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Experiments were conducted on the removal of\npollutants from CPP wastewater using electrocoagulation (EC). Two types of EC-reactors with horizontally and\nvertically arranged sacrificial iron electrodes were used for this purpose. The treatment efficiency of the CPP\nwastewater using iron sacrificial anode was checked by changing the pH of the mixtures, EC operating time, and\nthe current density. EC was found to be a feasible process for treating the CPP wastewater. The results showed\nthat COD, BOD5, fecal coliform, NH3-N, and oil\u2013grease can be effectively removed by EC. Treatment mechanism\nwas discussed by characterizing EC-floc through XRD, SEM/EDS, and FTIR techniques. The BOD/COD ratio for\nEC treated CPP was found to be 0.53. The optimal current density was determined as 4 mAcm?2\n. Vertical\nelectrode assembly was more efficient to treat poultry wastewater than that of horizontal electrode assembly. EC\noperating time and current density have significant influences for improving removal efficiency.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Andrew J.G.
