Modern radar-based smart sensors make it possible to track individual vehicles in close prox-imity to an intersection. These advancements in technology potentially enable the provision of vehicle-and site-specific decision dilemma zone protection at the onset of the yellow indication at signalizedintersections. To exploit this opportunity, it is critical to develop an in-depth understanding of those fac-tors influencing a driver\u2019s decision to stop or go at the onset of yellow. This study investigates how signaltiming strategies such as yellow interval durations, all-red clearance intervals, advance warning flashers,and automated camera enforcement affect driver decision-making. Data from 87 intersection approachesacross five regions of the United States are used to develop a series of decision (i.e., probability of stopping)curves using vehicle trajectory and signal phasing data. A panel data random parameters probit model isused to account for heterogeneity across locations, as well as correlation in driver decision-making, dueto unobserved factors that are unique to each signalized intersection. The results demonstrate drivers aremore likely to stop at locations where enforcement cameras or flashers are present. Stopping was alsomore prevalent at intersections with lower speed limits, longer crossing distances, and where pedestriancrosswalks were present.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Peter T.
