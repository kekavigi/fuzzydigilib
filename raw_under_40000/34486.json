{"Nomor": 34486, "Judul": "Microbial assessments of soil with a 40-year history of reclaimed wastewater irrigation", "Abstrak": "The long-term effects on soil microorganisms from 40 years of irrigating soil with reclaimed wastewater was investigated by determining the quantity, composition, and inter-species connection of microorganisms. No significant difference in microbial quantity and composition were identified in the reclaimed wastewater- and\ngroundwater-irrigated soils. The dominant bacterial phylum in both irrigation water sources and soils was\nProteobacteria, which commonly exists in soil. From the analysis of four (4) alpha diversity metrics, including\nthe observed number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), Chao1, and the Shannon and Simpson diversity,\nthere was no significant difference between the reclaimed wastewater- and groundwater-irrigated soils. Three\nzones (shallow, medium and deep) were identified in the reclaimed wastewater- and groundwater-irrigated\nsoils based on the taxonomic networks and clusters generated by graphical lasso and random walk algorithm.\nThe cluster profiles (shallow, medium and deep zones) appear to be different in the reclaimed wastewaterand groundwater-irrigated soils. Soil irrigated with reclaimed wastewater showed less depth of clustered profile\nin medium zone than that in soil irrigated with groundwater (20\u201360 cm of reclaimed wastewater-irrigated soil\ncompared to 20\u2013100 cm of groundwater-irrigated soil), although the significance of such a variance (the depth of\nmedium zone of reclaimed wastewater-irrigated soil decreased 40 cm than that of groundwater-irrigated soil) is\nnot clear at this time. Positive influence has been identified in the growth and yield of eggplant, tomato and cucumber between the reclaimed wastewater- and groundwater-irrigated soils, suggesting that reclaimed", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Binghua Li [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yongtao Cao.,Xiangyu Guan.,Yuehua Li.,e , Zhongyong Hao.,Wei Hu.,Liang Chen"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Soil microbiology Soil microbial ecology Water reuse Recycled wastewater Groundwater irrigation", "Sumber": "Science of the Total Environment 651 (2019) 696\u2013705", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Feb 2019"}
