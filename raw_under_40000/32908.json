Many white dwarfs are bound by gravity to other stars, some in such close orbits that they strip mass from their companions. This matter settles onto the white dwarf \u2019s surface through a process termed accretion. We thought\nwe knew the main modes of accretion onto white dwarfs, but on page 210, Scaringi et al.2\nreport that there might be another \u2014 one that links white dwarfs to other accreting celestial objects, such as neutron stars.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "THOMAS MARSH [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Astronomi", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Astrofisika", "Sumber": "14 DECEMBER 2017 | VOL 552 | NATURE | 179", "Staf Input/Edit": "pustaka bosscha", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Jan 2019"}
