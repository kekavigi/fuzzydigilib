{"Nomor": 35390, "Judul": "Preparation Of Fluidized Catalytic Cracking Slurry Oil-In-Water Emulsion As Anti-Collapse Agent For Drilling Fluids", "Abstrak": "Fluidized catalytic cracking slurry oil-in-water emulsion (FCCSE) was prepared by using interfacial\ncomplexes generation method that was simple and versatile. The critical factors influencing the\nsample preparation process were optimized, for instance, the optimum value of the mixed\nhydrophile-lipophile balance of compound emulsifier was 11.36, the content of compound emulsifier was 4 wt%, the emulsification temperature was 75 C, the agitation speed was 200 rpm, and\nthe emulsification time was 30e45 min. The performance as a drilling fluid additive was also\ninvestigated with respect to rheological properties, filtration loss and inhibition of FCCSE. Experimental results showed that FCCSE was favorable to inhibiting clay expansion and dispersion and\nreducing fluid loss. Furthermore, it had good compatibility with other additives and did not affect\nthe rheological properties of drilling fluids. FCCSE exhibited better performance than the available\nemulsified asphalt. It has a promising application as anti-collapse agent in petroleum and natural\ngas drilling.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zhengqiang Xiong [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Shixian Tao", "Xiaodong Li", "Fan Fu", "Yanning Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Anti-collapse agent, Fluidized catalytic cracking slurry oil-inwater emulsion, Fluidized catalytic cracking slurry, Borehole stability, Emulsified asphalt", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 4, Pages 361-368 (December 2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Feb 2019"}
