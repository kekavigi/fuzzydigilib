{"Nomor": 33482, "Judul": "Microplastic ingestion by the farmed sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus in China", "Abstrak": "Microplastic ingestion by the farmed sea cucumber is undocumented. Microplastics were isolated from\nthe sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus that was collected from eight farms along the Bohai Sea and the\nYellow Sea in China. To examine microplastic ingestion, the intestines were isolated, digested and then\nsubjected to the floatation test. The microplastic abundance in the sediment ranged from 20 to 1040\nparticles kg1 of dry sediment, while the ingested microplastics ranged from 0 to 30 particles intestine1\n.\nAfter filtering the coelomic fluid, the extracted microplastics from the coelomic fluid ranged from 0 to 19\nparticles animal1\n. Thus, we speculated that microplastics may transfer to the coelomic fluid of sea\ncucumber. The ingested microplastics did not correlate with the animal body weight but was site\ndependent, suggesting that sea cucumber may serve as sentinel for microplastic pollution monitoring in\nthe sediment. The microplastics were identified by Fourier transform infrared micro spectroscopy, and\nthe polymer types were mainly cellophane, polyester, and polyethylene terephthalate. This study\nrevealed that, microplastics widely existed in sea cucumber farms, and that sea cucumbers ingest\nmicroplastics as suitable with their mouth open. Moreover, the microplastics might transfer to the\ncoelomic fluid of the sea cucumber. Further investigations are needed to assess the chronic effect of the\nmicroplastics on the growth and physiological status of the sea cucumber.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mohamed Mohsen [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Qing Wang.,, Libin Zhang.,Lina Sun.,Chenggang Lin., Hongsheng Yang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Sea cucumber Microplastics ingestion Deposit feeder Coelomic fluid Sediment", "Sumber": "Environmental Pollution 245 (2019) 1071-1078", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Jan 2019"}
