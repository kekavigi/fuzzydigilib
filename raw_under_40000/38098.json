{"Nomor": 38098, "Judul": "Determination of allowable bearing capacity of shallow foundation using modified hyperbolic stress-strain model", "Abstrak": "Nondestructive test methods like Spectral Analysis of Surface Wave (SASW) are widely used in\ngeophysics and geotechnical area to find a shear wave velocity model of the subsoil for various\napplications. This study employed the SASW method to determine shear wave velocity and\ndamping parameters at various locations at a construction site. The predicted shear wave velocity\nalong the depth was predicted in this study and then was used to determine the soil profile in the\nground. Shear wave velocity variation in depth, along with the damping ration predicted through\nthe Half Power Bandwidth method from the SASW measurements were employed to predict the\nallowable bearing capacity of a pad footing. The hyperbolic stress-strain model of Hardin and\nDrnevich (1972) and the empirical equation proposed by Tezcan et al. (2006) were utilized to\npredict the allowable bearing capacity. Results showed that, the average differences between the\nallowable bearing capacity of shallow foundation calculated from theoretical and Vs based\nempirical equations with Macintosh Probe test were consistent.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mohammad Ghavami [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mohammadreza Mir Tamizdoust 2, Omid Ghasemi-Fare"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "SASW; Shear wave velocity; damping; hyperbolic stress-strain model; bearing capacity", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics, S0926-9851(18)30289-1, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2019.04.012", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Mei 2019"}
