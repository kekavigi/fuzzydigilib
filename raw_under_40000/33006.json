{"Nomor": 33006, "Judul": "Effects Of Rock Pore Sizes On The PVT Properties Of Oil And Gas-Condensates In Shale And Tight Reservoirs", "Abstrak": "Shales make up a large proportion of the rocks with extremely low permeability representing many\nchallenges which can be complex in many cases. A careful study of rock and fluid properties (i.e.\nPVT of shales) of such resources is needed for long-term success, determining reservoirs quality,\nand increased recovery factor in unique unconventional plays. In this communication, a comprehensive thermodynamic modelling is undertaken in which capillary pressure is coupled with the\nphase equilibrium equations. To this end, the data associated with both shale oil and gascondensates of Eagle Ford shale reservoir located in South Texas, U.S., is used. Different properties, including bubble and dew point pressures, capillary pressure, interfacial tension, liquid and gas\ndensities, and liquid and gas viscosities, are predicted observing the effects of rock pore sizes by the\nthermodynamic modelling performed in this study. The results demonstrate that the thermodynamic model developed in this study is capable of simulating the PVT properties of oil and gascondensates in shale and tight reservoirs. For a binary mixture 25:75 C1/C6, the bubble point\npressure at different reservoir temperature is increased by increasing the pore sizes from 10 to\n50 nm. Furthermore, an increase in pore sizes from 10 to 50 nm can increase the dew point\npressure for a studied binary mixture 75:25 C1/C6", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ARASH KAMARI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Lei Li, James J.
