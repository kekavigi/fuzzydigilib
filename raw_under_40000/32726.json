{"Nomor": 32726, "Judul": "ADOMIAN POLYNOMIALS FORNONLINEAR RESPONSE OF SUPPORTED TIMOSHENKO BEAMS SUBJECTED TOAMOVING HARMONIC LOAD", "Abstrak": "This paper investigates the steady-state responses of a Timoshenko beam of infinite\nlength supported by a nonlinear viscoelastic Pasternak foundation subjected to a moving har-\nmonic load. The nonlinear viscoelastic foundation is assumed to be a Pasternak foundation with\nlinear-plus-cubic stiffness and viscous damping. Based on Timoshenko beam theory, the nonlin-\near equations of motion are derived by considering the effects of the shear deformable beams and\nthe shear modulus of foundations at the same time. For the first time, the modified Adomian\ndecomposition method (ADM) is used for solving the response of the beam resting on a nonlin-\near foundation. By employing the standard ADM and the modified ADM, the nonlinear term is\ndecomposed, respectively. Based on the Green\u2019s function and the theorem of residues presented,\nthe closed form solutions for those linear iterative equations have been determined via complex\nFourier transform. Numerical results indicate that two kinds of ADM predict qualitatively iden-\ntical tendencies of the dynamic response with variable parameters, but the deflection of beam\npredicted by the modified ADM is smaller than that by the standard ADM. The influence of\nthe shear modulus of beams and foundation is investigated. The numerical results show that the\ndeflection of Timoshenko beams decrease with an increase of the shear modulus of beams and\nthat of foundations.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hu Ding [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "nonlinear, infinite Timoshenko beam, Pasternak foundations, Adomian decompo- sition method, modified decomposition", "Sumber": "Science Direct", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Jan 2019"}
