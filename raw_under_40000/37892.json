{"Nomor": 37892, "Judul": "A Kirchhoff migration imaging method based on grounded-source TEM virtual wave-fields and its applications", "Abstrak": "This research study was based on a Kirchhoff migration imaging method, and the aim of the study was to realize\ngrounded-source transient electromagnetic virtual wave-field migration. Diffusion equations mainly characterize the induction characteristics of low-frequency electromagnetic waves which are not suitable for wavefields. Wave equations mainly characterize wave reflections, refractions, and other propagation features, which\nare suitable for wave-field imaging processes. A unique mathematical transformation relationship exists between\nthe diffusion fields of transient electromagnetic fields and seismic wave-fields. After the transformations from\ndiffusion fields to virtual wave-fields are achieved, seismic interpretation methods can be used for the transient\nelectromagnetic data interpretations. First, in order to realize Kirchhoff migration imaging based on transient\nelectromagnetic wave-fields, precondition regularization methods are used for the wave-field inverse transformations. Then, after obtaining the wave-field data, dynamic correction methods are adopted to convert the\ngrounded-source transient electromagnetic virtual wave-fields to quasi-seismic zero offset data. At that point,\na Kirchhoff integral can be applied to realize the grounded-source transient electromagnetic quasi-seismic migration imaging. A theoretical model was used to test the method which was proposed in this study. The results\nshowed that the Kirchhoff migration imaging was able to determine the geometric formations of underground\ndielectric interfaces, which fully demonstrated the applicability of the proposed method. Finally, migration imaging processing was performed on the data obtained from a mining area, and the imaging results were found to be\nconsistent with the known geological data. Therefore, the feasibility of using a wave-field transform method and\nKirchhoff migration imaging technology for grounded-source transient electromagnetic data interpretations was\nsuccessfully confirmed", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zhipeng Qi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiu Li, Qingquan Zhi, Jianmei Zhou"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Grounded-source transient electromagnetic data Virtual wave-fields Kirchhoff integral method Quasi-seismic imaging Dynamic corrections Wave-field transform", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 164 (2019) 247\u2013256, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2019.03.015", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Apr 2019"}
