{"Nomor": 37075, "Judul": "A Sustainable Redox Flow Battery with Alizarin-Based AqueousOrganic Electrolyte", "Abstrak": "To achieve sustainable development, biomassmaterials are alternative options for mitigating the problemsassociated with energy and the environment. Recently, solubleanthraquinones in aqueous redoxflow batteries have attractedextensive attention. Inspired by a natural anthraquinone dyenamed alizarin, here we report an affordable, sustainable, andefficient redoxflow battery electrolyte using a derivative ofalizarin, namely, alizarin-3-methyliminodiacetic acid, whichhas been easily synthesized from alizarin on an industrial scale.The battery exhibits an open-circuit voltage of 1.38 V, and themaximum power density exceeds 0.49 W cm?2. Also, thebattery has a stable cycling performance of 350 cycles with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.6%, energy efficiency of 84.2%,and capacity retention of 99.98% per cycle, 99.97% per hour, and 99.19% per day at 0.1 A cm?2. Moreover, the battery system isenvironmentally friendly and provides novel ideas for biomass-derived green energy-storage systems.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Yiyang_Liu_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/163540"}, "Penulis": "Yiyang Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Shanfu Lu,Sian Chen,Haining Wang,Jin Zhang,Yan Xiang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "redoxflow battery, aqueous organic electrolyte, anthraquinone, derivative of alizarin, natural dye", "Sumber": "ACSAppl.EnergyMater.XXXX, XXX, XXX?XXX", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Mar 2019"}
