{"Nomor": 32936, "Judul": "New Insights Into Porosity Determination Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques For Carbonate Reservoirs", "Abstrak": "The porosity of the petroleum reservoirs is considered one of the most important parameters in reserve\nestimation because it determines the effective volume of the hydrocarbon that is stored in the reservoir.\nBased on the reserve estimation, the development plan can be set and managed. Porosity can be\ndetermined in the laboratory which is the most expensive methods. Porosity also can be determined\nfrom the logs such as density, neutron, sonic, and NMR logs. There are a lot of uncertainties in the\nporosity estimation from wireline logs because it depends on many statistical analysis and also is affected\nby the logging environment and logging tools. The prediction of the porosity from different porosity logs\nusing artificial intelligence (AI) methods validated with the laboratory measured values is the best\nmethod to determine an accurate value of the rock porosity.\nThe objective of this research is to evaluate AI tools such as artificial neural network (ANN), Support\nvector machine (SVM) and Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to predict the reservoir\nporosity based on wireline log data. More than 1700 field measurements of porosity with logs data were\nused for training and testing the AI techniques.\nThe results obtained showed that ANN and ANFIS can be used to estimate the reservoir porosity based\non log data with a high correlation coefficient (R) and low average absolute percentage error (AAPE). The\nmain inputs required for porosity estimation are bulk density, neutron porosity, and sonic compressional\ntime. The developed mathematical equation based on the weights and bias of the ANN model can be\nused to predict the reservoir porosity based on log data with a correlation coefficient of 0.98 and an AAPE\nless than 8%. The advantage of this work is that we extracted the mathematical model from the ANN that\ncan be used directly to determine the porosity without the need for training and testing the data. The\nporosity estimation from the neutron-density crossplots, which is the current technique used by the\nindustry, yielded 14.7% error", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SALAHELDIN, ZEESHAN TARIQ [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mohamed Mahmoud, Abdulazeez Abdulraheem"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Porosity, Artificial intelligence, Neural network, Carbonate reservoir, Logging", "Sumber": "Petroleum 4 (2018) 178-186 - KeAi, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.04.002", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Jan 2019"}
