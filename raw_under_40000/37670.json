{"Nomor": 37670, "Judul": "Authentic mobile-biometric signature verification system", "Abstrak": "This is an undeniable fact that in the coming years a considerable percentage of organisations are drifting\ntoward mobile devices for authentication. Banking sector as an additional offshoot has shifted to mobile devices with their applications for e-banking and mobile-banking, giving rise to an emergent requirement of a foolproof and authentic mobile-biometric system. This study presents an authentic mobile-biometric signature verification system and a comparative analysis of the performance of the proposed system for the two datasets; one using the standard device that is used for capturing biometric signatures and the other one is a mobile database taken from a smart phone for biometric signature authentication. The results presented demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms existing mobile-biometric signature verification systems based on dynamic time warping and hidden Markov model. Moreover, this study presents a comprehensive survey of mobile-biometric systems, different devices and hardware needed to support mobile biometrics along with open issues and challenges faced by the mobilebiometric systems. The experiments presented establish that the performance of mobile devices is low as compared with normal biometric signature capturing devices and the major reason the authors found is the absence of pen-tilt angle information in the mobile device datasets.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Farhana Javed Zareen  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Suraiya Jabin"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Mobile Biometrics", "Sumber": "IET Biometrics", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Apr 2019"}
