{"Nomor": 34968, "Judul": "Designing Cost-Sharing Methods for Bayesian Games", "Abstrak": "We study the design of cost-sharing protocols for two fundamental resource allocation problems, the Set Cover and the Steiner Tree Problem, under environments of incomplete information (Bayesian model). Our objective is to design protocols where the worst-case Bayesian Nash equilibria have low cost, i.e. the Bayesian Price of Anarchy (PoA) is minimized. Although budget balance is a very natural requirement, it puts considerable restrictions on the design space, resulting in high PoA. We propose an alternative, relaxed requirement called budget balance in the equilibrium (BBiE). We show an interesting connection between algorithms for Oblivious Stochastic optimization problems and cost-sharing design with low PoA. We exploit this connection for both problems and we enforce approximate solutions of the stochastic problem, as Bayesian Nash equilibria, with the same guarantees on the PoA. More interestingly, we show how to obtain the same bounds on the PoA, by using anonymous posted prices which are desirable because they are easy to implement and, as we show, induce dominant strategies for the players.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP GEORGE CHRISTODOULOU 1": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/158261"}, "Penulis": "George Christodoulou [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Stefano Leonardi, Alkmini Sgouritsa"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Price of anarchy,  Bayesian games,  Network design,  Cost-sharing games", "Sumber": "Theory of Computing Systems  January 2019, Volume 63, Issue 1, pp 4\u201325  Cite as", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Feb 2019"}
