{"Nomor": 36602, "Judul": "Sustaining Technical Efficiency and the Socialised Home: Examining the Social Dimension within Sustainable Architecture and the Home", "Abstrak": "Sustainable concerns appear increasingly prevalent to almost all scopes of industry, with\nsociety also becoming progressively aware and active towards the importance of sustainability.\nHousing is often identified as a core contributor to the UK energy concerns, with 27% of the country\u2019s\nC02 emissions produced through the burning fossil fuels with the home (Edwards & Hyett: 2002;\nDECC:2009). The built environment commonly presents sustainability from a technological construct,\nwhereby research organisations keenly promotes technologies that address sustainable proficiency\n(Smith: 2003) and governmental guidance has focused designers and engineers to implement sustainable\ntechnologies, as a means of technical measurement. Whilst techno-rational constructs within sustainable\narchitecture have thus provided a \u2018how it works\u2019 or \u2018can do\u2019 approach, this limits the social consideration\n(Roy & Herring:2007). However sociological perspectives see social factors as central to sustainability\nand in losing sight of this, many technical oriented built environments have been significantly\nless efficient than predicted (Chappells & Shove:2000). Drawing from various multi-disciplinary\nperspectives, this paper examines the literature which has begun to address this issue. Discussions\nwill further highlight how this social context can impact on our perception of efficiency, through two\nspecific case-studies. These findings will review users\u2019 actual experiences of living in existing sustainable\nhousing; in terms of acceptance and adoption of sustainable practice. By providing a specific focus\non domestic housing, this paper looks to highlight the importance of the social beyond being technically\nefficient, and calls for a more widespread consideration of social elements; user interactions, comfort,\nacceptance and adoption of technology. Whilst the focus may appear specific, there is strong correlation\nto the wider understanding of technologies that are considered in and for society, opening up the\nsustainability debate to a more rounded perspective.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Phillipa Marsh [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Architecture", "Kata Kunci": "Sustainability, Technologies, Social Impacts, Adoption", "Sumber": "The International Journal of Interdisciplinary Social Sciences Volume 5, Number 5, 2010, http://www.SocialSciences-Journal.com, ISSN 1833-1882 \u00a9 Common Ground, Phillipa Marsh, All Rights Reserved, Permissions: cg-support@commongroundpublishing.com", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Mar 2019"}
