The structure of the\nprepared LDH material was systematically studied. Under UV irradiation, the desulfurization efficiency of the LDH\nmaterial was 87% in 2 h. For La3?\u2013Zn2?\u2013Al3?\u2013MoO4\n2- LDH material, the introduction of MoO4\n2- increased the\ninterlayer space for promoting the adsorption of benzothiophene (BT), and MoO4\n2- might provide active sites for the\noxidation of BT, resulting in the high desulfurization efficiency", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "LI-GUO GAO [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Huan-Xiang Li", "Xiao-Li Song1 \u2022 Wan-Lu Li", "Xiang-Rong Ma"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "LDH, Homogeneous precipitation, Photocatalytic activities, Catalytic oxidation mechanism", "Sumber": "Petroleum Science (2019) 16:173\u2013179 https://doi.org/10.1007/s12182-018-0285-3", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Feb 2019"}
