In the context of these studies basic problems related to the development\nof advanced large-capacity aircraft of a flying-wing (FW) configuration have been studied at TsAGI since\nthe late-1980s (Byushgens, Aviation in XXI century, Symposium on \u2018\u2018Aeronautical Technology in XXI\nCentury\u2019\u2019, Moscow, September1989; Denisov et al., Conceptual design for passenger airplane of very large\ncapacity in \u2018\u2018flying wing\u2019\u2019 layout, ICAS 96-4.6.1, 1996). In the present paper primary emphasis is placed on\nthe rationale of selecting FW main design solutions, aerodynamic configuration, structural concept as well\nas on development and analysis of alternative configurations. Consideration is also given to the problem,\nwhich is in the opinion of experts the most critical for this airplane type, namely, meeting FAR-25\nstandards with respect to airplane operation in emergency situations. At present the work on this concept is\nbeing conducted under the International Scientific and Technical Center grant No. 548. The project\ncollaborators are AIRBUS INDUSTRIE and Boeing.\n\n@2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "A.L. BOLSUNOVSKY [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["N.P.
