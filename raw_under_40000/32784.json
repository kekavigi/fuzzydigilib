{"Nomor": 32784, "Judul": "THEORETICALAND EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES OF STRESS DISTRIBUTION IN WEDGE-SHAPED GRANULAR HEAPS", "Abstrak": "The present work explains the statics of self-weight transmission restricted to a long\nprismatic heap inclined at an angle of repose and symmetrically formed on a rigid base. The closure\nof polarized principal axes with the mobilized state of stress along the slope surface is employed\nby imposing the orientation of principal stresses on the equilibrium equations. Comparisons were\nmade with calculations based on the finite element method using an elastic model. Moreover,\nexperiments on sand heaps deposited on a rectangular rigid base were conducted to validate the\ntheoretical study. The measured pressure profile generally agreed well with theoretical results.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Thirapong Pipatpongsa [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Tadaki Matsushita, Maho Tanaka, Shinichi Kanazawa, Katsuyuki Kawai"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "granular materials, sand, continuum medium, analytical method, finite element method, experimental techniques", "Sumber": "Science Direct", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "03 Jan 2019"}
