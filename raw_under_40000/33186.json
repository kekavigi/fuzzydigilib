{"Nomor": 33186, "Judul": "Principal time constant map, a more accurate mapping tool for helicopter TEM data", "Abstrak": "Time constant maps are widely used as a preliminary interpreting tool and effective means for data quality assessment\nin helicopter transient electromagnetic (HTEM) surveys. It can be used to quickly and qualitatively indicate\nthe distribution of geological anomalies. A new time constant method, called Principal Time Constant\n(PTC) method, is proposed in this paperwhich directly processed the linear sampled data and can provide an unbiased\nestimation of time constant compared with the traditional methods, Apparent Time Constant (ATC)\nmethod and Sliding Time Constant (STC) method. In order to estimate the performance and stability of these\nthree methods, Monte Carlo simulations have been used with different signal to noise ratios. The simulation results\nshow that the time constant estimated by the PTC method is closer to the true value than that by the ATC\nand STC methods and the variance of time constant evaluated by the PTC method is closer to the Cramer-Rao\nLow Boundary, which shows that the PTC method has the most stable performance in the time constant estimation.\nTo verify the effectiveness of the PTC method, a field surveywas conducted in Inner Mongolia by the HTEM\nsystem for measured data. The time constant maps, produced by different methods respectively, are consistent\nwith the local geology of the survey area in general. However, the map produced by the PTC method has a higher\ncontrast of the time constant value for different targets and shows better consistency with the geological map.\nThe following quantitative insight of resistivity-depth slice also verifies the features revealed in the time constant\nmap, which proves the effectiveness of the time constant map produced by the PTC method", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Pan Xiao  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xin Wu, Zongyang Shi, Rui Guo, Yuxi Pang, Guangyou Fang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Time constant Mapping method Helicopter TEM Monte Carlo simulation Cramer-Rao Low Boundary", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 159 (2018) 260\u2013267, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.08.001", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Jan 2019"}
