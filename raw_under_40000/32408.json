{"Nomor": 32408, "Judul": "Smart City and Geospatial Information Availability, Current Status in Indonesian Cities (Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 227 ( 2016 ) 265 \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd 269)", "Abstrak": "Developing smart city requires many types of information, including geospatial information. Geospatial information serves as the base data from which other data will be referenced upon. The production, provision and dissemination of geospatial information in Indonesia are regulated by Law 4/2011 on Geospatial Information. However, only few areas have been mapped at the scale of 1:10,000 and 1:5,000. This situation left many cities without large scale map able to depict building footprints or parcel boundaries. To obtain information on the geospatial information availability in Indonesian cities, a survey has been carried out nationally from April \u2013 July 2015, as part of a research on spatial data infrastructure. 90 cities/districts participated in the survey. The findings show that majority of the cities/districts have limited availability of large scale topographic maps and land parcel maps. With regard to developing smart cities, these issues should be put in the mainstream to get higher priority.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "HERI SUTANTA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Trias Aditya., Retno Astrini"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Geospatial information, smart city, availability, management, spatially enabled government", "Sumber": "Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 227 ( 2016 ) 265 \u2013 269", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yoninur Almira", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
