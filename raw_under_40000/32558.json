{"Nomor": 32558, "Judul": "Super Mechanical Stimuli Responsive Hydrogel: Dynamic Cues for Cell Applications", "Abstrak": "In this work, we fabricated a thermosensitive hydrogel based on NIPAM that incorporated an oxygen-permeable\nhyaluronic acid (HA) polysaccharide unit. The interpenetrating network (IPN) of NIPAM-HA-MA hydrogel was fabricated by\nusing an ultraviolet (UV) cross-linking process. Importantly, we explored the real behavior kinetics of the hydrogel via the\nmechanical properties of Young\n\u2019\ns modulus and the shear strain. The mechanical properties were reduced when the temperature\nwas raised from 25 to 35\n\u00b0\nC, and lower temperatures increased the rigidity of the IPN gel. This dynamic change occurred\nbecause of NIPAM\n\u2019\ns thermosensitive character. Further, IPN hydrogel exhibits good transparency with the incorporation of\nMA-HA and this stimuli-responsive hydrogel was biocompatible with a human dermal\nfi\nbroblasts cell line (HDF). The cells\nadherence was densest when the temperature reached 37\n\u00b0\nC and was reduced when the temperature was lowered to 25\n\u00b0\nC. We\nenvision using such hydrogels as mimics of cell-instructive biomaterials in tissue engineering applications.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ravichandran H.
