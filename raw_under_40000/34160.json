{"Nomor": 34160, "Judul": "Magnetotelluric investigations in the southern end of the Cambay basin (near coast), Gujarat, India", "Abstrak": "Cambay basin is one of the major onshore oil-bearing sedimentary basins of India situated at its\nwestern margin in Gujarat state. The region is seismically active and experiences three\ndevastating earthquakes in the past. The region comes under the seismic zone IV and V and\nnecessitates the extensive geophysical studies in for subsurface characteristics and identification\nof hidden faults in the region for seismic hazard estimation. A magnetotelluric (MT) survey has\ncarried out in the southwestern part of the Cambay basin to identify the sedimentary thickness,\nthe depth of Deccan trap and for identification of West Cambay margin that passes through the\nregion. The MT data, at 13 stations, in the broad frequency range is acquired along an east-west\nprofile with an inter-station spacing of 2-3 km. After processing and analysis of the data, transfer\nfunctions in the period band of 0.001-300s are used for two-dimensional joint inversion. The\nresultant structure from the 2-D modeling infers the sedimentary thickness of ~0.5 km. A high\nconductive zone dipping towards east observed in the eastern part of the profile might be due to\nthe West Cambay fault. Basement fracturing at a depth of 2.5-3.0 km at the central portion of the\nprofile might act as a heat exchanger between the deeper geothermal source and nearby hot water\nspring.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Kapil Mohan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Peush Chaudhary, G.
