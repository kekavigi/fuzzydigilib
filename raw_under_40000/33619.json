{"Nomor": 33619, "Judul": "Prediction of reservoir quality using well logs and seismic attributes analysis with an artificial neural network: A case study from Farrud Reservoir, Al-Ghani Field, Libya", "Abstrak": "This paper presents an innovative technique that aims to predict the quality of a petroleum reservoir using\nArtificial Neural Networks (ANN) analysis of seismic, well logs and core data. A supervised Probabilistic Neural\nNetwork (PNN) was deployed to predict several reservoir properties, one at a time, through training and\nvalidation of the PNN to determine the seismic attributes that best fit a measured property in the well logs.\nThe validated PPN models accurately converted the available 3D seismic data into shale volume, porosity, permeability and water saturation cubes. In addition, these predicted reservoir properties were integrated to define various reservoir grades using K-means Clustering algorithm of unsupervised classification ANN. This technique is\napplied to Al-Ghani Field and four grades of reservoir quality were classified as very good, good, bad, and very\nbad and their spatial distributions were displayed. The highest reservoir grade is characterized by good porosity\nand permeability and significantly low water saturation. Such information is highly valuable for optimum reservoir management and well placement. This not only maximizes reservoir profitability through production\nschemes, but also minimizes uncertainties in drilling, production, injection, and modeling processes. In addition,\nadopting the proposed methodology would decrease costs in well logging programs and improve the sweeping\nefficiency of water flooding operations", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Abdulaziz M.
