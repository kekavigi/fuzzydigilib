{"Nomor": 35558, "Judul": "Roles of quorum sensing in biological wastewater treatment: A critical review", "Abstrak": "Quorum sensing (QS) and quorum quenching (QQ) are increasingly reported in biological wastewater\ntreatment processes because of their inherent roles in biofilm development, bacterial aggregation,\ngranulation, colonization, and biotransformation of pollutants. As such, the fundamentals and ubiquitous\nnature of QS bacteria are critical for fully understanding the process of the wastewater treatment system.\nIn this article, the details of QS-based strategies related to community behaviors and phenotypes in\nwastewater treatment systems were reviewed. The molecular aspects and coexistence of QS and QQ\nbacteria were also mentioned, which provide evidence that future wastewater treatment will indispensably rely on QS-based strategies. In addition, recent attempts focusing on the use of QQ for biofilm or\nbiofouling control were also summarized. Nevertheless, there are still several challenges and knowledge\ngaps that warrant future targeted research on the ecological niche, abundance, and community of QSand QQ-bacteria in environmental settings or engineered systems.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Naga Raju Maddela [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Binbin Sheng.,, Shasha Yuan.,Zhongbo Zhou.,Ronald Villamar-Torres.,Fangang Meng"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Biofilm Microbial community Quorum quenching Quorum sensing Wastewater treatment", "Sumber": "Chemosphere 221 (2019) 616-629", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Feb 2019"}
