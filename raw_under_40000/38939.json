{"Nomor": 38939, "Judul": "Hybrid Chalcopyrite?Polymer Magnetoconducting Materials", "Abstrak": "The search for emerging materials combining magnetic and semiconducting properties has attracted widespread\ninterest in contemporary materials science. Chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), as an earth abundant and nontoxic chalcogenide compound\nin the I?III?VI2 family, is a promising class of such materials that exhibit unusual electrical, optical, and magnetic properties.\nHowever, its successful implementation largely depends on our ability to understand, control and manipulate their structural,\ntransport and spin behavior. Here we show that solution processing monodispersed CuFeS2 quantum dots exhibit a strong\ncoupling among optical, electronic, and magnetic degrees of freedom. The photoresponse and magnetoconductance of CuFeS2\nquantum dots are realized under external stimuli. We further exploit a fast and efficient way to achieve an exceptionally large\nperformance in a magneto-optoelectronic hybrid system consisting of magnetic semiconducting CuFeS2 and conducting polymer\nmatrix. The results demonstrate a promising potential of magnetic semiconductor CuFeS2 in the field of spin electronics", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Zhuolei Zhang 1.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170668"}, "Penulis": "Zhuolei Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Beibei Xu, Lin Zhang, and Shenqiang Ren"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "nanocrystals, magnetism, optoelectronics, magnetic semiconductor, organic?inorganic hybrid materials", "Sumber": "www.acsami.org  DOI: 10.1021/acsami.6b03362 ACS Appl.
