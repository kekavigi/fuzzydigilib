{"Nomor": 33358, "Judul": "2.5D electric resistivity forward modeling with element-free Galerkin method", "Abstrak": "An element-free Galerkin method (EFGM) is proposed to perform the direct current (DC)\nresistivity modeling problems. The advantage of this method is the absence of elements, which makes\nnodes free from the elemental restraint. In this method, the moving least square (MLS) approximation\nis employed to construct the shape function. And the cubic spline function with high continuity is used\nas a weight function. Then, the boundary value problem and the corresponding variation problem of\nDC resistivity modeling problems are discussed. The discrete equations of two and a half dimensional\n(2.5D) DC resistivity modeling problems are obtained by using the Galerkin weak form formulation.\nThereby, a 1D multilayered geoelectric model is adopted to verify the validity of the proposed EFGM.\nAnd the further tests of complicated geoelectric models illustrate that the correctness, good\nadaptability and flexibility of EFGM compared with the finite element method (FEM). The EFGM\ncan conveniently simulate the undulating terrain and improve the simulation accuracy by refining\nnodes in local domain. In addition, the discretization of test models shows that EFGM is easy to\nhandle the complicated geometrical geoelectric models by using arbitrary and irregular nodes. All\nthese tests demonstrate that the EFGM is suitable to perform forward modeling for complicated\ngeoelectric models.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Changying Ma [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jianxin Liu, Haifei Liu, Rongwen Guo, Bello Musa, Yi-an Cui"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "EFGM; MLS shape function; Direct current resistivity; Forward simulation", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics, S0926-9851(16)30261-0 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.12.021", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Jan 2019"}
