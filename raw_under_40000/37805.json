The basic planar design is known to be inefficient, due to the poor utilization of beta particle emition to generate electron-hole pairs along the depth of semiconductor. Creating a deep trenches etching on a substrate could be one of the solution to optimize the utilization of beta particle, increasing the active area and energy density of cell to gain a better electrical performance. As the basic approach for simulation, the deep trenches design is divided into several regions based on the direction of beta particle emittion and the energy deposition profile of the responsible regions. The Monte Carlo N-Particle code was used to simulate beta particle interaction along the depth of p-n junction silicon semiconductor. The carrier transport was analysed by using minority carrier diffusion equation for 2-D time-independent case, which the 2-D model of electron-hole pairs generation is introduced. A nickel radioisotope 63Ni was implemented as the beta radiation source which the decay condition is described by the beta energy spectra of 63Ni and the activity of source was chosen about 0.25 mCi. From our simulation results, the deep trenches betavoltaic battery is predicted to have short-circuit current density about 14.574 nA/cm2 with dark saturation current density about 0.168 nA/cm2 and the off-circuit voltage about 0.151 Volt. Compared to basic planar design from our previous result, the deep trenches etched design could give a significant boost the performance of the battery, multiplying the power density about 4.39 times and the radiation-electricity conversion efficiency about 4.36 times.", "Daftar File": {"2015_EJRNL_PP_SWASTYA_RAHASTAMA_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/166434"}, "Penulis": "Swastya Rahastama [10210037]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Abdul WARIS, Khairul BASAR, Ferry ISKANDAR, Widayani SUTRISNO"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Physics", "Kata Kunci": "betavoltaic, conversion efficiency, deep trenches design, nuclear battery, radiation-induced current density,", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "hidayat", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Apr 2019"}
