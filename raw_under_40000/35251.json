{"Nomor": 35251, "Judul": "Time lapse (4D) and AVO analysis: A case study of Gullfaks field, Northern North Sea", "Abstrak": "A 4D seismic or time lapse survey has been used to investigate the amplitude versus offset (AVO) effects on\nseismic data in order to identify anomalies in the Gullfaks field for three different reservoir intervals namely the\nTarbert, Cook and Statfjord reservoirs. Repeatability analysis has shown that the earlier seismic vintages are the\nmost unreliable for amplitude anomaly analysis as normalised root-mean square (NRMS) values are greater than\n50%. This is above the threshold of good and medium repeatability. Fluid substitution models show increases in\nboth P-wave velocity and density for increasing water saturations with a maximum change of 7.33% in the Pwave\nvelocity, and this is in line with predictions from previous work using the Biot - Gassman equations. AVO\nmodelling for the top Tarbert Formation interface produced scenarios of increasing amplitudes with offset for the\npresence of hydrocarbons, which dim out with 100% brine saturation. This correlates to class III gas sands for\ndifferent situations of varying Poisson\u2019s ratio across an interface, which has been previously modelled. Two\nanomalies were identified with one being related to increasing pressure due to water injection correlating to\npoor permeability around injector well 34/10-B-33. The second anomaly is a case of potential unswept hydrocarbons\nthat displayed a consistent bright spot throughout all of the seismic vintages (in-inlines and crosslines).\nAVO attribute analysis of this event produced a class II anomaly. However, when comparing near and far\noffset seismic data, dimming effect was observed producing contrasting evidence. The dimming offset is viewed\nto have been as a result of poor repeatability values at far offsets. The modelling of the fluid contents in the\nstudied formations to conform to existing literatures justifies the efficacy of the method", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Emmanuel Bassey Umoren [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Nyakno Jimmy George"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Time lapse AVO analysis Gullfaks field NRMS and repeatability test", "Sumber": "NRIAG Journal of Astronomy and Geophysics 7 (2018) 62\u201377, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrjag.2018.03.004", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Feb 2019"}
