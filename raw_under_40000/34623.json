The study also delineates zones\nof isolated low resistivity values (10\u201350 ? m) at the mid and west end of the field. The generated resistivity\ndistribution sections, maps and 3D model indicate spatial variation in resistivity value which varies both laterally\nand vertically. The variation which is attributed to differences imposed by underlying rock\u2019s structural and\ngeological rock composition resulted from complex rock coexistence as schist (quartz- and amphibolitic-schist)\nand quartzite coexist as underlying rocks of the proposed construction site, especially since these rocks respond\nto weathering differently.\nThe generated subsurface resistivity model guided selection of geotechnical investigation points which captures\nspatial variation in subsurface physical properties as recorded by the measured subsurface resistivity.\nBetter guided geotechnical investigation provided needed information required to design appropriate foundation\nsupport for the proposed engineering structure.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Olawale Olakunle Osinowo [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Michael Oluseyi Falufosi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Engineering structure Foundation rocks Spatial variability Georesistivity imaging Quartz-schist", "Sumber": "NRIAG Journal of Astronomy and Geophysics, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrjag.2018.07.001", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Feb 2019"}
