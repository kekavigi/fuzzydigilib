Therefore, various model were introduced to relate reservoir properties and water saturation. Since carbonate reservoir is very heterogeneous in shape and size of pore throat, the relation between water saturation and other\ncarbonates reservoir properties is very complex, and causes considerable overall errors in water\nsaturation calculation. By increasing the usage and improvement of soft computing methods in\nengineering problems, petroleum engineers have been attended them to measure the petrophysical\nproperties of the reservoir.\nIn this study, a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) improved by genetic algorithm has\nbeen employed to estimate formation water saturation by using conventional well-logging data.\nThe used logging and core data have been gathered from a carbonated formation from one of\noilfield located in south-west Iran, and finally their results of the proposed model were compared\nwith the core analysis results. By checking the testing data from another well, it showed this\nmethod had a 0.027 for mean square errors and its correlation coefficient is equal to 0.870. These\nresults implied on high accuracy of this model for oil saturation degree estimation. While the\ncommon methods like Archie, had a 0.041 mean square error and 0.720 of the correlation coefficient, which indicate a high ability of RBF model than the other usual empirical methods", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hamid Heydari Gholanlo  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Masoud Amirpour", "Saeid Ahmadi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Water saturation, Radial basis function neural network, Genetic algorithm, Archie model, Carbonate reservoir", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 2, Pages 166-170 (June  2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Mar 2019"}
