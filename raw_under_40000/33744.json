{"Nomor": 33744, "Judul": "Smart Conducting PANI/P(St-NIPAM) Particles and Their Switchable Conductivity", "Abstrak": "Particles with circumstance-responsive conductivity have an appealing performance in constructing sensors. Here, \u201csmart\u201d conducting polyaniline-doped poly(styrene-co-N-isopropylacrylamide) composite spheres, i.e. PANI/P(St-NIPAM) particles, are  reported. A series of PANI/P(St-NIPAM) particles can be prepared with different ratios of N-isopropylacrylamide to monomers, i.e. N/M ratios. With the improved N/M ratios in polymerization, the amount of polyaniline (PANI) incorporating into the produced particles increased, resulting in an enhanced conductivity. With the improved N/M ratios, the hydrodynamic diameters of PANI/P(St-NIPAM) particles increased at a low temperature, whereas they decreased at a high temperature; resulting in the enhanced volume-change ability with the increasing poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) content in particles. Depending on the temperature-induced volume change, these particles exhibit \u201csmart\u201d conductivity in a homemade device, in which these particles can be used as a temperatureresponsive conducting medium to construct an \u201con?off\u201d circuit, and the switch of an LED lamp can be triggered by\ntemperature. These particles with the smart conducting property provide wide potential applications in sensors, microelectronics, energy storage, and other fields.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jiawei Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jiahui Liu, Feiyang Ma, and Jiguang Liu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "switchable conductivity, smart conducting particle, responsive polymer, volumetric change, smart circuit", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Jan 2019"}
