{"Nomor": 36604, "Judul": "FACES OF SUSTAINABLE HOUSING", "Abstrak": "The past few decades several attempts have been made to get a better understanding\nof the diversity in appearance and expression of sustainable architecture. This paper\nwill investigate different recent approaches to classification of sustainable residential\ndesign. Two recent student projects focusing on the contemporary context in The\nNetherlands will be presented to illustrate these classification approaches.\nFirst a brief summary of relevant publications dealing with recent attempts to classify\nthe aesthetic dimension of sustainable architecture will be presented. These various\ntaxonomy endeavors show both the variety and similarities particularly in the applied\nvocabulary.\nLed by these selected contemporary publications two recent case studies will be\npresented: a design project by 24 master students at the Eindhoven University of\nTechnology (TU/e) and a research project involving 14 master TU/e-students.\nIn the design studio the assignment was to design a housing complex for 36 students\nlocated in Rotterdam. Key issue in the project was the explicit instruction to\ninvestigate the possibilities of replacing building services and devices by passive\narchitectural and spatial solutions. Analyzing the results afterwards the designs can be\nrelated to the vocabulary derived from the classification approaches in the selected\nreferences.\nIn the research project students investigated a self-compiled best-practice anthology\nof 21 recent Dutch autarkic and/or sustainable housing projects. They had the\npublications [1], [2], [3] to their disposal. Besides documenting the projects, part of\nthe research were interviews with both the architect and the occupants to come to a\nproper understanding of autarkic and sustainability aspects of each housing project.\nThey also compiled a method to measure autarky- and sustainability-indices for\ncomparison.\nThe paper concludes with investigating the correlation between scores on autarky and\nsustainability scales, and the position in the aesthetic spectrum as proposed in the\nstudent\u2019s research project.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "M.
