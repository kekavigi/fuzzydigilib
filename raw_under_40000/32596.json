{"Nomor": 32596, "Judul": "Gene \ufffd\ufffd Environment interaction: What exactly are we talking about??", "Abstrak": "An ambiguity exists in how psychological scientists use the word \u201cinteraction.\u201d This word can\nrefer to physical interactions between components that form the mechanisms in complex systems,\nbut it can also refer to statistical interactions revealed by General Linear Statistical Models (e.g.,\nAnalyses of Variance). Statistical interactions indicate that the nature of the relationship between\ntwo variables depends on a third variable, but the discovery of such interactions does not constitute evidence of physical interactions between components in a system. Studies conducted\nusing traditional behavioral genetics methods sometimes reveal statistical interactions between\ngenes and environments, but the presence or absence of such interactions tell us surprisingly little\nabout actual, physical interactions between genes and their contexts. This is important, because it\nis only the latter kinds of interactions that cause the development of behavioral phenotypes,\nincluding developmental disabilities. Therefore, when behavioral scientists discover (or fail to\ndiscover) Genotype \u00d7 Environment interactions, it is important to exercise care in interpreting\ntheir meaning and in assessing the utility of such findings.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "David S.
