{"Nomor": 32868, "Judul": "Black-hole-regulated star formation in massive galaxies", "Abstrak": "Supermassive black holes, with masses more than a million times that of the Sun, seem to inhabit the centres of all massive galaxies1,2. Cosmologically motivated theories of galaxy formation\nrequire feedback from these supermassive black holes to regulate star formation3. In the absence of such feedback, state-of-the-art numerical simulations fail to reproduce the number density and\nproperties of massive galaxies in the local Universe4\u20136. There is, however, no observational evidence of this strongly coupled coevolution between supermassive black holes and star formation, impeding our understanding of baryonic processes within galaxies. Here we report that the star formation histories of nearby massive galaxies, as measured from their integrated optical spectra, depend on the mass of the central supermassive black hole. Our results indicate that the black-hole mass scales with the gas cooling rate\nin the early Universe. The subsequent quenching of star formation\ntakes place earlier and more efficiently in galaxies that host highermass central black holes. The observed relation between black-hole\nmass and star formation efficiency applies to all generations of\nstars formed throughout the life of a galaxy, revealing a continuous\ninterplay between black-hole activity and baryon cooling", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "IGNACIO MARTIN-NAVARRO [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jean P.
