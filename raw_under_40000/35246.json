{"Nomor": 35246, "Judul": "Preliminary Assessment Of CO2 Injectivity In Carbonate Storage Sites", "Abstrak": "Depleted gas reservoirs are used for a large-scale carbon dioxide (CO2) storage and reduction of the\ngreenhouse gas released into the atmosphere. To identify a suitable depleted reservoir, it is\nessential to do a preliminary and comprehensive assessment of key storage factors such as storage\ncapacity, injectivity, trapping mechanisms, and containment. However, there are a limited number\nof studies providing a preliminary assessment of CO2 injectivity potential in depleted gas reservoirs\nprior to a CO2 storage operation. The aim of this study is to provide a preliminary assessment of a\ngas field located in Malaysia for its storage potential based on subsurface characterization prior to\ninjection. Evaluation of the reservoir interval based on the facies, cores, and wireline log data of a\nwell located in the field indicated that the pore type and fabrics analysis is very beneficial to\nidentify suitable locations for a successful storage practice. Although the results obtained are\npromising, it is recommended to combine this preliminary assessment with the fluid-mineral interactions analysis before making any judgment about reliability of storage sites.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Arshad Raza  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Raoof Gholami", "Reza Rezaee", "Chua Han Bing", "Ramasamy Nagarajan", "Mohamed Ali"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "CO2 storage, Injectivity, Carbonate reservoir, Lithofacies, Petrophysics", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 3, Issue 1, Pages 144-154 (March 2017)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Feb 2019"}
