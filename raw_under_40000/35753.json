{"Nomor": 35753, "Judul": "WILLIS METAMATERIAL ON A STRUCTURED BEAM", "Abstrak": "Bianisotropy is common in electromagnetism whenever a cross-coupling between electric and magnetic\nresponses exists. However, the analogous concept for elastic waves in solids, termed as Willis coupling, is\nmore challenging to observe. It requires coupling between stress and velocity or momentum and strain\nfields, which is difficult to induce in non-negligible levels, even when using metamaterial structures. Here,\nwe report the experimental realization of a Willis metamaterial for flexural waves. Based on a cantilever\nbending resonance, we demonstrate asymmetric reflection amplitudes and phases due to Willis coupling.\nWe also show that, by introducing loss in the metamaterial, the asymmetric amplitudes can be controlled\nand can be used to approach an exceptional point of the non-Hermitian system, at which unidirectional zero\nreflection occurs. The present work extends conventional propagation theory in plates and beams to include\nWillis coupling and provides new avenues to tailor flexural waves using artificial structures.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "YONGQUAN LIU [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["ZIXIAN LIANG,", "JIAN ZHU,2LINGBO XIA,", "OLIVIER MONDAIN-MONVAL,", "THOMAS BRUNET,", "ANDREA AL\u00d9,", "AND JENSEN LI"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW X 9, 011040 (2019); Published by the American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Mar 2019"}
