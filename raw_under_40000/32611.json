{"Nomor": 32611, "Judul": "Perylene-Based Fluorescent Nanoprobe for Acid-Enhanced Detection of Formaldehyde in Lysosome", "Abstrak": "Formaldehyde (FA), as a reactive carbonyl\nspecies, is extremely hazar\ndous to human health if its\nconcentration is above normal level. In live cells, lysosome is\na main organelle to generate endogenous FA. Thus, the design\nof facile, stable, and sensitive probes for the detection of FA in\nlysosome is essential. Herein, a self-assembled\nfl\nuorescent\nnanoprobe based on homoallylamino substituted perylene (P-\nFA) has been developed for FA detection in lysosome. P-FA\ncan react with FA along with emission color change from blue\nto green. P-FA exhibited high sensitivity and selectivity to FA in\nDMSO solution. In aqueous solution, P-FA self-assembled into uniform sphere-like nanoparticle as a\nfl\nuorescent nanoprobe.\nFurthermore, the reaction between the nanoprobe and FA was greatly facilitated at pH 4\n?\n5, which led to a lower detection limit\n(0.96\n?\nM at pH 5) than that in DMSO. In live cells, P-FA nanoprobe achieved long-term tracking of lysosome (over 12 h). The\nfl\nuorescent nanoprobe was then used for both exogenous and endogenous FA detection. Our work provides a facile and\ne\nff\nective strategy for the detection of FA in lysosome.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Chendong Ji [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Le Ma", "Hongtao Chen", "Yang Cai", "Xujie Zhao", "Meizhen Yin"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemical engineering", "Kata Kunci": "perylene, fl uorescent nanoprobe, weak acidity, formaldehyde detection, lysosome", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
