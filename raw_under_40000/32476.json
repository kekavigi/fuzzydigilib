This\nresearch study explores participants\u2019 perception of SPD in green buildings. A questionnaire survey was\nconducted to investigate how the participants rated the importance and difficulty of SPD-related variables\nand items. The Kendall concordance test and ManneWhitney U test were used to analyse and\ncompare the responses of participants involved directly and indirectly in SPD, where the participants\nwere divided into Group 1 and Group 2 respectively. The results showed a good consensus between the\nrankings provided by the two groups. The Relative Importance Index was used to calculate the scores and\nrankings. The top 5 most important variables and the most difficult ones to realize, and the top 5 most\nimportant items and the most difficult ones to realize, were identified and analysed respectively. Environmental protection was regarded as the most important variable, and open space was considered as the most difficult one to achieve. The most important item was water pollution reduction, and the most\ndifficult one was rational underground space utilisation. When considering the correlation between the\nimportance and difficulty of the items and variables, the participants show different concerns on the\nmost important and most difficult items while hold similar opinions on the most important and most\ndifficult variables. The findings deepen the understanding of variables which are most important and\nwhich are most difficult to achieve in the SPD of green buildings, which helps the practitioners to\nimplement effective SPD in green buildings.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "XIAOSEN HUO [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ann T.W.
