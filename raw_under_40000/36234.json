In this work, we demonstratethe inductive effect in nickel oxide nanosheet arrays (NSAs) via doping withthe lower electronegative element Mn, which has greatly improved theirelectrochemical capacitance and stability. Density functional theory (DFT)calculations show that the inductive effect in Mn?NiO increases the electrontransport efficiency, enhances the adsorption energy of OH?, and also makesthe compound more covalent. Therefore, Mn?NiO NSAs demonstrated adramatically improved specific capacitance twofold better than that of pureNiO NSAs at a current density of 5 mA cm?2and higher stability without anydecay of capacitance after 10 000 cycles at 30 mA cm?2. Moreover, the hybridsupercapacitor device of Mn?NiO NSAs//graphene?CNT exhibited anexcellent recycling stability after 50 000 cycles of charging/discharging at 6 A g?1with comparative energy density and powerdensity", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Xu_Han_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/161834"}, "Penulis": "Xu Han [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Can Yang,Bingqing Wang,Ge Meng,Ruifeng Zhao, Qiannan Hu,Okky Triana,Muzaffar Iqbal,Yaping Li, Aijuan Han,Junfeng Liu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "inductive effect, Mn doped-NiO, nanosheet arrays, electron transport, high stability, hybrid supercapacitor", "Sumber": "ACSAppl.EnergyMater.XXXX, XXX, XXX?XXX", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Mar 2019"}
