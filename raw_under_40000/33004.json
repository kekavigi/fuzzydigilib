{"Nomor": 33004, "Judul": "Diagenesis And Reservoir Quality Of The Upper Triassic Chang 6 Member In Jingan Oilfield, Ordos Basin, China", "Abstrak": "The Chang 6 reservoir of Yanchang formation in Jingan oilfield has relatively poor quality: the porosity\nranges mainly from 8 to 14%, and permeability ranges from 0.018 to 10.48 md, with a mean of 1.10 md,\ncategorized as low porosity and low permeability reservoir type with strong heterogeneity. Petrographic\nand geochemical analyses of various components in these sandstones have provided clues of diagenesis.\nThe sandstones at the early stage of diagenesis are characterized by non-ferroan calcite cementation,\ngrain-coating, pore-lining clay minerals, and initial dissolution of detrital grains. Authigenic quartz, porefilling and grain-replacive laumontites, albitized detrital plagioclase, authigenic K-feldspar, illite and late\nferroan calcite cement dominate the late diagenesis. Reservoir quality is influenced by products of late\ndiagenesis stage, the cement (calcite, albite, quartz, illite, and laumontite) occluded primary and secondary porosity. The organic acidic fluid derived from organic matter in the source rocks during the late\ndiagenesis, which results in the dissolution of detrital plagioclase and laumontite cement and was the\nmain reason for the enhancement of reservoir-quality. As a result of that, the residual primary pore and\ndissolution pore comprised the main accumulation space for oil and gas, and thus become important\ntargets for hydrocarbon exploration.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "BIN LI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jun Peng, Qingsong Xia, Jiatong Xie, Meijianzi Han"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Ordos basin, Chang 6 member, Diagenesis, Reservoir-quality, Dissolution", "Sumber": "Petroleum 4 (2018) 126-133 - KeAi, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.03.002", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Jan 2019"}
