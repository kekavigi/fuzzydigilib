{"Nomor": 34625, "Judul": "Chemical and microbiological characterization of cruise vessel wastewater discharges under repair conditions", "Abstrak": "Cruise ship wastewater discharges are pollution sources towards the marine environment that are poorly\ncharacterized. In this study, wastewater samples from cruise ships have been obtained during repair works in a\nshipyard. Different organic pollutants have been analyzed and their concentrations were similar to those in\nurban wastewaters for pharmaceuticals and fragrances, but higher for UV filters and PAHs. For the first time,\ncypermethrin, a pesticide highly toxic towards aquatic species, was found at relevant concentrations (> 1 \u00b5g L^-\n1). The faecal microorganisms were for all parameters higher than 10^4 CFU 100 mL^-\n1, which together with the\npresence of antibiotic compounds in wastewater (e.g., triclosan), could potentially lead to the generation of\nantibiotic resistance bacteria (ARB). The historical position of cruise ships, determined from the Automatic\nIdentification System (AIS), were used to define the time ships were underway, at port, or in repair. From ship's\npassenger and crew load, and from estimates of discharges the total volume of wastewater produced by these\nships (371,000 m^3 year^-1) and the average flow (0.15 \u00b1 0.03 m^3crew^-1 day^-1) were calculated.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Isa\u00edas Vicente-Cera [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Javier Moreno-Andr\u00e9s.,David Amaya-V\u00edas., Miriam Biel-Maeso.,Marina G.
