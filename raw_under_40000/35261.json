{"Nomor": 35261, "Judul": "Culture and attention: Recent empirical findings and new directions in cultural psychology", "Abstrak": "Over the past 3 decades, cultural psychologists have empirically investigated the influence of cultural meaning systems on human psychology. Under the rubric of holistic versus analytic thought,\nresearchers have demonstrated that there are substantial cultural variations in social cognition, and that such variations are observable even in so?called fundamental psychological processes, such\nas attention. The aim of this paper is to review 3 major themes in culture and attention: (1) culture and attention to nonsocial scenes,(2) culture and attention to social scenes, and (3) culture and aesthetics. The paper also discusses 4 major strands of research that could be considered important candidates to further advance the understanding of culture and attention: (1) research on\u201cculture?\nhuman psychological processes,\u201d where we investigate how culture influences modes of attention; (2) research on\u201chumanpsychology?cultural processes,\u201d where we investigate how those who hold a specific mode of attention create cultural products and tangible representations of culturally shared meanings; (3) research on cultural neuroscience, where we investigate underlying mechanisms and processes of specific modes of attention; and (4) researchon cultural transmission processes, where we investigate how specific modes of attention is taught by adults and internalized by children.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Takahiko Masuda [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Humanities, culture, social science", "Sumber": "Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Feb 2019"}
