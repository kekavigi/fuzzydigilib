{"Nomor": 35895, "Judul": "DIRECT IMAGING OF THE ENERGY-TRANSFER ENHANCEMENT BETWEEN TWO DIPOLES IN A PHOTONIC CAVITY", "Abstrak": "Photonic cavities are gathering a large amount of interest to enhance the energy transfer between two\ndipoles, with far-reaching consequences for applications in photovoltaics, lighting sources, and molecular\nbiosensing. However, experimental difficulties in controlling the dipoles\u2019 positions, orientations, and\nspectra have limited the earlier work in the visible part of the spectrum, and have led to inconsistent results. Here, we directly map the energy transfer of microwaves between two dipoles inside a resonant halfwavelength cavity with ultrahigh control in space and frequency. Our approach extends F\u00f6rster resonance energy-transfer (FRET) theory to microwave frequencies and bridges the gap between the descriptions of FRET using quantum electrodynamics and microwave engineering. Beyond the conceptual interest, we show how this approach can be used to optimize the design of photonic cavities to enhance dipole-dipole interactions and FRET.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "KAIZAD RUSTOMJI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["MARC DUBOIS,", "BORIS KUHLMEY,", "C.
