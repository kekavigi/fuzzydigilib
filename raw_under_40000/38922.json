{"Nomor": 38922, "Judul": "Polymer-Composite Materials for Radiation Protection", "Abstrak": "Unwanted exposures to high-energy or ionizing\nradiation can be hazardous to health. Prolonged or\naccumulated radiation dosage from either particle-emissions\nsuch as alpha/beta, proton, electron, neutron emissions, or\nhigh-energy electromagnetic waves such as X-rays/? rays, may\nresult in carcinogenesis, cell mutations, organ failure, etc. To\navoid occupational hazards from these kinds of exposures,\nresearchers have traditionally used heavy metals or their\ncomposites to attenuate the radiation. However, protective\ngear made of heavy metals are not only cumbersome but also\nare capable of producing more penetrative secondary\nradiations which requires additional shielding, increasing the\ncost and the weight factor. Consequently, significant research efforts have been focused toward designing efficient, lightweight,\ncost-effective, and flexible shielding materials for protection against radiation encountered in various industries (aerospace,\nhospitals, and nuclear reactors). In this regard, polymer composites have become attractive candidates for developing materials\nthat can be designed to effectively attenuate photon or particle radiation. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art of polymer\ncomposites reinforced with micro/nanomaterials, for their use as radiation shields", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Shruti Nambiar 1.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170649"}, "Penulis": "Shruti Nambiar [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["d John T.
