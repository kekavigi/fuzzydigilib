{"Nomor": 34554, "Judul": "Kinetics and mechanistic study of n-alkane hydroisomerization reaction on Pt-doped ?-alumina catalyst", "Abstrak": "The catalysts g-alumina (GA, the reference catalyst) and Pt doped g-alumina (PGA-s) were synthesized using a simple sol-gel technique, in which at first preparation of porous base (GA), then\nimpregnation of platinum salt over the base and finally reduction of platinum in the surface of the\nsupport were done. These catalysts prepared in different mole ratios of Pt:Al as 2:1, 1:1 and 1:2 are\nnamed as PGA-1, PGA-2 and PGA-3 respectively. The isomerization of n-alkanes (n-hexane, nheptane and n-octane) were investigated over the synthesized catalysts. The 2-methyl pentane (2-\nMP), 2,2-dimethyl pentane (2,2-DMP) and 2,3-dimethyl hexane (2,3-DMH) are the major products\nof respective isomerization of n-hexane, n-heptane and n-octane, besides a small amount of other\nbranched isomers are also produced. The product distribution is comparable to that reported for Pt\nbased other catalysts. The optimal mole ratios of Pt:Al is 1:1 (PGA-2) gives quite good catalytic\nactivity for isomerization of n-alkane. Even through in reusability study, PGA-2 gives better performance than others. We have mainly focused on kinetic study, reaction mechanism behind\nisomerization and calculated the order of reactions and activation energies of the isomerization\nreactions in the present work.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Abhishek Dhar  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Rohit L.
