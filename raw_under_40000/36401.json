{"Nomor": 36401, "Judul": "Comparison of weighting techniques for acoustic full waveform inversion", "Abstrak": "To reconstruct long-wavelength structures in full waveform inversion (FWI), the wavefield-damping and\nweighting techniques have been used to synthesize and emphasize low-frequency data components in\nfrequency-domain FWI. However, these methods have some weak points. The application of wavefielddamping method on filtered data fails to synthesize reliable low-frequency data; the optimization formula\nobtained introducing the weighting technique is not theoretically complete, because it is not directly derived\nfrom the objective function. In this study, we address these weak points and present how to overcome them.\nWe demonstrate that the source estimation in FWI using damped wavefields fails when the data used in the\nFWI process does not satisfy the causality condition. This phenomenon occurs when a non-causal filter is applied\nto data. We overcome this limitation by designing a causal filter. Also we modify the conventional weighting\ntechnique so that its optimization formula is directly derived from the objective function, retaining its original\ncharacteristic of emphasizing the low-frequency data components. Numerical results show that the newly\ndesigned causal filter enables to recover long-wavelength structures using low-frequency data components\nsynthesized by damping wavefields in frequency-domain FWI, and the proposed weighting technique enhances\nthe inversion results", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Gangwon Jeong [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jongha Hwang, Dong-Joo Min"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Acoustic wave equation Weighting technique Full waveform inversion (FWI) Laplace transform", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 147 (2017) 16\u201327, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.10.007", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Mar 2019"}
