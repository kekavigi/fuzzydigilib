{"Nomor": 36439, "Judul": "Bamboo-reinforced self-compacting concrete beams for sustainable construction in rural areas", "Abstrak": "The use of bamboo as longitudinal reinforcement, coupled with the application of\nself-compacted concrete (SCC) in the construction industry, may be a promising\nsolution to issues involving sustainable development in developing countries. This\nstudy seeks to investigate the flexural performance of bamboo-reinforced SCC beams\nwith adequate transverse reinforcement. The major design parameters were the shear\nspan-to-depth ratio, the percentage of longitudinal reinforcement, and the maximum\nsize of coarse aggregate. The load\u2013deflection curves, serviceability and ultimate failure\ncharacteristics, cracking behavior, and ductility measures were evaluated and discussed\namong tested beams. Results indicated that their structural performance at\nservice and ultimate failure would be adequate when a material reduction factor of\nthree is used with BS 8110 design code. However, to achieve maximum ductility,\nthe level of longitudinal reinforcement should be in range of 2.6\u20133.1%. Furthermore,\nan increase in the size of coarse aggregate will greatly impact the degree of ductility.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mark Adom-Asamoah [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jack Osei Banahene, Jacqueline Obeng , Eugene Antwi Boasiako"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "bamboo, ductility, flexure, RC beams, self-compacting concrete", "Sumber": "2017 fib.
