{"Nomor": 38610, "Judul": "Catalyzing the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) with Molybdenum Sulfide Nanomaterials", "Abstrak": "We discuss recent developments in nanostructured molybdenum sulfide catalysts for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction. To develop a framework for performing consistent and meaningful comparisons\nbetween catalysts, we review standard experimental methodologies for measuring catalyst performance and define two\nmetrics used in this perspective for comparing catalyst activity:\nthe turnover frequency, an intrinsic activity metric, and the\ntotal electrode activity, a device-oriented activity metric. We\ndiscuss general strategies for synthesizing catalysts with\nimproved activity, namely, increasing the number of electrically\naccessible active sites or increasing the turnover frequency of\neach site. Then we consider a number of state-of-the-art molybdenum sulfide catalysts, including crystalline MoS2, amorphous\nMoSx, and molecular cluster materials, to highlight these strategies in practice. Comparing these catalysts reveals that most of the\nmolybdenum sulfide catalysts have similar active site turnover frequencies, so the total electrode activity is primarily determined\nby the number of accessible active sites per geometric electrode area. Emerging strategies to overcome current catalyst limitations\nand potential applications for molybdenum sulfide catalysts including photoelectrochemical water splitting devices and\nelectrolyzers are also considered.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Jesse D.
