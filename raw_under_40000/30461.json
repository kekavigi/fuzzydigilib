If financial distress cannot be \n\nrelieved, it can lead to bankruptcy. For investors, especially long-term investor, it is \n\nprominent to be sure that a corporate will withstand and not suffer from bankruptcy. \n\nThe Altman\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s Z-score is an empirical model for credit-strength test that predicts the \n\nprobability of corporate bankruptcy. However, the emergence of large, public service \n\ncompanies prompted him to develop a second Z-score model for non-manufacturing \n\ncompanies, which is used in this research. The formula is essentially the same as \n\nbefore; it just excludes the last component (sales / total assets) because Altman \n\nwanted to minimize the effects of manufacturing-intensive asset turnover. \n\nThis study will aim to find the correlation between the bankruptcy risk, depicted by Zscores, \n\nand market performance, which depicted by trading volume, share price and \n\nshare return, of the company using the correlation analysis. The results of this study \n\nshows significant correlations between Z-scores and trading volume of PT \n\nTelekomunikasi Indonesia, PT XL Axiata Tbk and PT Inovisi Infracom Tbk; significant \n\ncorrelations between Z-scores and its share price on PT XL Axiata Tbk, PT Inovisi \n\nInfracom Tbk and PT Bakrie Telecom Tbk; but show no significant correlations \n\nbetween Z-score and its share return of all the studied companies. The Z-score will \n\nresults from the calculation using Altman\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s Z-score equation model for nonmanufacturer \n\ncompany while the other variables are gathered from the IDX market \n\nactivity records. The companies used in this research are Indonesian \n\ntelecommunication companies listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange from the period \n\nJanuary 2009 until March 2014.", "Daftar File": {"2014 TA PP RIFA INTANIA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/138924", "2014 TA PP RIFA INTANIA 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/138925", "2014 TA PP RIFA INTANIA 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/138926", "2014 TA PP RIFA INTANIA 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/138927", "2014 TA PP RIFA INTANIA 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/138928", "2014 TA PP RIFA INTANIA 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/138929"}, "Penulis": "Rifa Intania (19011076)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Anggoro Budi Nugroho"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "bankruptcy, market performance, Altman\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019 Z-score, market activity, financial distress", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Taupik Abidin \u00a0\n                                     Taupik Abidin", "File": "6 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Sep 2018"}
