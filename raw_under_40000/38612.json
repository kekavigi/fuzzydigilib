{"Nomor": 38612, "Judul": "Engineered Nanomaterials for Infection Control and Healing Acute and Chronic Wounds", "Abstrak": "Nanoengineered biomaterials have dramatically\nexpanded the range of tools used for infection control and to\naccelerate wound healing. This review thoroughly describes the\ndevelopments that are shaping this emerging field and evaluates\nthe potential wound healing applications of recently developed\nengineered nanomaterials for both acute and chronic wounds.\nSpecifically, we will assess the unique characteristics of engineered\nnanomaterials that render them applicable for wound healing and\ninfection control. A range of engineered nanomaterials, including\npolymeric-, metallic- and ceramic-based nanomaterials, that could\nbe used as therapeutic delivery agents to accelerate regeneration of\ndamaged dermal and epidermal tissues are also detailed. Finally,\nwe will detail the current state of engineered nanomaterials for\nwound regeneration and will identify promising new research directions in infection control.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Madasamy Parani 1.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170045"}, "Penulis": "Madasamy Parani [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Giriraj Lokhande, Ankur Singh, Akhilesh K Gaharwar"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "engineered nanomaterials, nanoparticles, nanocomposites, wound healing, infection control, antimicrobial", "Sumber": "www.acsami.org", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Mei 2019"}
