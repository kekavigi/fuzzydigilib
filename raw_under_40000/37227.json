{"Nomor": 37227, "Judul": "IMPROVEMENT OF GLIBENCLAMIDE SOLUBILITY BY INCLUSION COMPLEX FORMATION WITH CYCLODEXTRIN", "Abstrak": "The aim of this study was to improve the aqueous solubility of the oral\nhypoglycemic agent, glibenclamide, in order to improve its absorption, and\nhence its bioavailability after oral administration. Several approaches have been\ndone to improve the solubility of glibenclamide. One of them is by the\nformation of an inclusion complex. In this study, we did the complexation of\nglibenclamide with cyclodextrin by comparing two different types of\ncyclodextrin, i.e. ?-cyclodextrin (?CD) and 2-hydroxyropyl-?- cyclodextrin\n(HP?CD). The complex was prepared by two different methods, i.e. freeze\ndrying (FD) and coevaporation (CO). The phase solubility studies were\nperformed for 2 days in phosphate buffer pH 7.4. The obtained solution was\nfiltered and the glibenclamide concentration was measured by using High-\nPerformance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with UV-Vis detector at the\nwavelength of 300 nm. Furthermore, the FD and CO products were prepared by\ndissolving ?CD and HP?CD in ammonia-water solution. The reaction was\ncarried out for 1 day, and the solvents were eliminated by either freeze drying\nfor FD product or using rotary evaporator for CO product. The dissolution\nstudy was conducted to evaluate the influence of complexation on the\ndissolution rate of glibenclamide. Furthermore, Differential Scanning\nCalorimetry (DSC), X-ray Powder Diffraction (X-RD), and Fourier-Transform\nInfrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) studies were performed to characterize the\npowder properties. The highest stability constant was obtained from the\ncomplex prepared using HP?CD, and the highest percentage of dissolved\nglibenclamide was obtained from FD product of complexation with HP?CD. In\naddition, the DSC, XRD, and FTIR results confirmed the chemical interaction\nbetween glibenclamide and cyclodextrin.", "Daftar File": {"2019_TS_PP_MOHAMED_MAHMUD_E__ALDEEB_1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/163982", "COVER Mohamed Aldeeb": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242697", "BAB 1 Mohamed Aldeeb": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242698", "BAB 2 Mohamed Aldeeb": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242699", "BAB 3 Mohamed Aldeeb": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242700", "BAB 4 Mohamed Aldeeb": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242701", "BAB 5 Mohamed Aldeeb": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242702", "BAB 6 Mohamed Aldeeb": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242703", "PUSTAKA Mohamed Aldeeb": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242704"}, "Penulis": "Mohamed Aldeeb [20716702]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Yeyet Cahyati Soemirtapura", "Dr. Diky Mudhakir, S.Si., M.Si.", "Dr. Amirah Adlia, S.Si., M.Si., Apt."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Farmasi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Farmasi", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "glibenclamide, ?CD, HP ?CD, dissolution", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana \u00a0\n                                     yana mulyana", "File": "9 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Mar 2019"}
