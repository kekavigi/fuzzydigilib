{"Nomor": 38595, "Judul": "Biomedical Applications of Graphene Nanomaterials and Beyond", "Abstrak": "Graphene nanomaterials have been considered as a novel class of\nnanomaterials that show exceptional structural, optical, thermal, electrical, and mechanical\nproperties. As a consequence, it has been extensively studied in various fields including\nelectronics, energy, catalysis, sensing, and biomedical fields. In the previous couple of\nyears, a significant number of studies have been done on graphene-based nanomaterials,\nwhere it is utilized in a wide range of bioapplications that includes delivery of small\nmolecule drugs/genes, biosensing, tissue engineering, bioimaging, and photothermal and\nphotodynamic therapies because of its excellent aqueous processability, surface\nfunctionalizability, outstanding electrical and mechanical properties, tunable fluorescence\nproperties, and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS).Therefore, it is necessary to\nget detailed knowledge about it. In this review, we will highlight the various synthesis\nprocedures of graphene family nanomaterials including graphene oxide (GO), reduced\ngraphene oxide (rGO), and graphene quantum dots (GQDs) as well as their biomedical\napplications. We will also highlight the biocompatibity of graphene nanomaterials as well as its possible risk factors for\nbioapplications. In conclusion, we will outline the future perspective and current challenges of graphene nanomaterials for\nclinical applications.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Krishanu Ghosa 1.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170028"}, "Penulis": "Krishanu Ghosal [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Kishor Sarkar"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "grpahene, nanomaterials, biomedical application, biosensor, drug delivery", "Sumber": "ACS Biomater.
