{"Nomor": 36002, "Judul": "INITIALIZATION OF SINGLE SPIN DRESSED STATES USING SHORTCUTS TO ADIABATICITY", "Abstrak": "We demonstrate the use of shortcuts to adiabaticity protocols for initialization, read-out, and coherent\ncontrol of dressed states generated by closed-contour, coherent driving of a single spin. Such dressed states have recently been shown to exhibit efficient coherence protection, beyond what their two-level\ncounterparts can offer. Our state transfer protocols yield a transfer fidelity of ?99.4\u00f02\u00de% while accelerating the transfer speed by a factor of 2.6 compared to the adiabatic approach. We show bidirectionality of the accelerated state transfer, which we employ for direct dressed state population read-out after coherent manipulation in the dressed state manifold. Our results enable direct and efficient access to coherenceprotected dressed states of individual spins and thereby offer attractive avenues for applications in quantum information processing or quantum sensing.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "J.
