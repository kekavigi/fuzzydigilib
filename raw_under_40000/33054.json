{"Nomor": 33054, "Judul": "Ring detected around a dwarf planet", "Abstrak": "Planetary rings capture the imagination with their stark beauty. Viewing Saturn and its extended ring system through even a small telescope is awe-inspiring and has drawn many people into studying science and engineering. In the Solar System, rings were thought to be present solely around the four giant planets (although only those of Saturn are easily visible from Earth). However, in the past few years, they have been unexpectedly identified around Centaurs1\u20133 \u2014 small bodies whose orbits lie between those of the giant planets. On page 219, Ortiz et al.4 report another piece of the planetary-rings puzzle, with the detection of a ring around the distant dwarf planet Haumea.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "AMANDA A.
