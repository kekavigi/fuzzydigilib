{"Nomor": 34832, "Judul": "The Sedimentary Facies Characteristics And Lithofacies Palaeogeography During Middle-Late Cambrian, Sichuan Basin And Adjacent Area", "Abstrak": "Combined with the regional strata filling characteristics of Middle-Upper Cambrian, the present\npaper conducts a systematic research on sedimentary facies in the basin and its peripheral area by\nutilizing 164 field outcrops and drilling and coring data. Further, the method of \u201cmulti-factor\ncomprehensive synthesis based on single-factor analysis\u201d was employed to investigate the sedimentary facies and palaeogeography of the study area and establish the sedimentary facies model.\nStratigraphic reveals that the study area represents the pattern of thin-northwest and thicksoutheast by stretching northeast-southwest. Within the present basin, the pattern of \u201cone thin\nand two thick\u201d predominates, while outside the basin \u201cfour thin and three thick\u201d filling feature was\nfound. Sedimentary facies shows that the study area was featured by rimmed carbonate platform.\nSpecifically, carbonate platform, slope and northeastern corner Qinling paleooceanic Basin and\nsoutheastern corner Jiangnan Bain was identified from the west to the east. The carbonate platform\ncontains restricted platform, evaporation-restricted platform, semi-restricted platform and the\nplatform margin. Single factor analysis and lithofacies palaeogeographic characteristics manifests\nthat during Middle-Late Cambrian, the western Old land evolved into peneplain stage, and that the\neastern and southwestern sub-sags remained connected to the open-sea to some extent. At the\ntime, the shllow seawater circulation was relatively restricted, while the ancient seabed tended to\nbe flat and evaporation characteristics significantly diminished. Secondary sea-level fluctuation\nintensively influenced the development of scaled grain beach. It is suggested that tide marginal\nbeach, intraplatform shoal subfacies zone, along with Shiqian-SangZhi in southeast and ZhenbaXinshan in northeast platform-margin beach subfacies zone to be preferable targets for the\nfavorable reservoir facies zone and potential oil and gas reservoir area", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Feifan Lu  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiucheng Tan", "Teng Ma", "Ling Li", ", Aiwei Zhao e , Chengpeng Su", "Jingqing Wu", "Haitao Hong"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Sedimentary facies, Paleogeography, Carbonate platform, Platform margin, Sedimentary facies model", "Sumber": "Sedimentary facies, Paleogeography, Carbonate platform, Platform margin, Sedimentary facies model", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Feb 2019"}
