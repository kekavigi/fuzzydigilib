{"Nomor": 37924, "Judul": "Detecting Fractional Chern Insulators through Circular Dichroism", "Abstrak": "Great efforts are currently devoted to the engineering of topological Bloch bands in ultracold atomic\ngases. Recent achievements in this direction, together with the possibility of tuning interparticle\ninteractions, suggest that strongly correlated states reminiscent of fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids\ncould soon be generated in these systems. In this experimental framework, where transport measurements are limited, identifying unambiguous signatures of FQH-type states constitutes a challenge on its own. Here, we demonstrate that the fractional nature of the quantized Hall conductance, a fundamental characteristic of FQH states, could be detected in ultracold gases through a circular-dichroic measurement, namely, by monitoring the energy absorbed by the atomic cloud upon a circular drive. We validate this approach by comparing the circular-dichroic signal to the many-body Chern number and discuss how such measurements could be performed to distinguish FQH-type states from competing states. Our scheme\noffers a practical tool for the detection of topologically ordered states in quantum-engineered systems, with\npotential applications in solid state.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "C.
