{"Nomor": 35045, "Judul": "Treatment of oily wastewater from drilling site using electrocoagulation followed by microfiltration", "Abstrak": "The present work deals with the utilization of electrocoagulation-microfiltration in batch mode for the treatment\nof oily wastewater containing oil, grease along with metals like Na, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Ni. Samples were pre-treated\nusing the electrocoagulation by varying working parameters such as current density (20\u201380 A/m2\n), electrode\ndistance (0.005\u20130.2 m) and initial pH (3.6\u20138.7). The concentration of oil and grease was reduced from 35 mg/L\nto 10.2 mg/L in just 20 min. Microfiltration was carried out using indigenously prepared ceramic membranes to\nremove these flocs generated during the electro-coagulation process at three different pressures of 98,196 and\n194 kPa.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "M.
