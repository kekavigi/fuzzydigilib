{"Nomor": 35694, "Judul": "Aldol Condensation of Cyclopentanone on Hydrophobized MgO. Promotional Role of Water and Changes in the Rate-Limiting Step upon Organosilane Functionalization", "Abstrak": "Aldol condensation is a key C-C coupling reaction for upgrading of biomass-derived oxygenates to fuels\nand chemicals. Here, we investigate the effects of added water on the condensation of cyclopentanone (CPO) on hydrophobized MgO catalysts. We have found that the role of water strongly depends on the degree of hydrophobic functionalization of the MgO surface. That is, on a nonfunctionalized (hydrophilic) high-surface-area MgO catalyst, the rate decreases with the addition of water, mostly due to active site blockage......", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Duong T.
