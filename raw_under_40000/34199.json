{"Nomor": 34199, "Judul": "DIAGNOSING LOW EARTH ORBIT SATELLITE ANOMALIES USING NO AA-15 DATA ASSOCIATED WITH GEOMAGNETIC PERTURBATION", "Abstrak": "A satellite placed in space is constantly afected by the space environment, resulting in various impacts from temporary faults to permanent failures depending on factors such as satellite orbit, solar and geomagnetic activities, satellite local time, and satellite construction material. Anomaly events commonly occur during periods of high geomagnetic activity that also trigger plasma variation in the low Earth orbit (LEO) environment. In this study, we diagnosed anomalies in LEO satellites using electron data from the Medium Energy Proton and Electron Detector onboard the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-15 satellite. In addition, we analyzed the fuctuation of electron fux in association with geomagnetic disturbances 3 days before and after the anomaly day. We selected 20 LEO anomaly cases registered in the Satellite News Digest database for the years 2000\u20132008. Satellite local time, an important parameter for anomaly diagnosis, was determined using propagated two-line element data in the SGP4  simplifed general perturbation model to calculate the longitude of the ascending node of the satellite through the position and velocity vectors. The results showed that the majority of LEO satellite anomalies are linked to low-energy electron fuxes of 30\u2013100 keV and magnetic perturbations that had a higher correlation coefcient (~ 90%) on the day of the anomaly. The mean local time calculation for the anomaly day with respect to the nighttime migration of  energetic electrons revealed that the majority of anomalies (65%) occurred on the night side of Earth during the duskto-dawn sector of magnetic local time", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "NIZAM AHMAD [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["D.
