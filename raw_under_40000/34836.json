{"Nomor": 34836, "Judul": "Discussion Of Liquid Threshold Pressure Gradient", "Abstrak": "Some authors believe that a minimum pressure gradient (called threshold pressure gradient (TPG))\nis required before a liquid starts to flow in a porous medium. In a tight or shale oil formation, this\nTPG phenomenon becomes more important, as it is more difficult for a fluid to flow. In this paper,\nexperimental data on TPG published in the literature are carefully reviewed. What we found is that\na very low flow velocity corresponding to a very low pressure gradient cannot be measured in the\nexperiments. Experiments can only be done above some measurable flow velocities. If these flow\nvelocities and their corresponding pressure gradients are plotted in an XY plot and extrapolated to\nzero velocity, a non-zero pressure gradient corresponds to this zero velocity. This non-zero pressure\ngradient is called threshold pressure gradient in the literature. However, in the regime of very low\nvelocity and very low pressure gradient, the data gradually approach to the origin of the plot,\ndemonstrating a non-linear relationship between the pressure gradient and the velocity. But the\ndata do not approach to a point of zero velocity and a threshold pressure gradient. Therefore, the\nconcept of threshold pressure gradient is a result of data misinterpretation of available experimental data.\nThe correct interpretation is that there are two flow regimes: nonlinear flow regime (non-Darcy\nflow regime) when the pressure gradients are low, and linear flow regime (Darcy flow regime)\nwhen the pressure gradient is intermediate or high. The nonlinear flow regime starts from the\norigin point. As the pressure gradient is increased, the curve becomes a straight line demonstrating\nthe linear flow regime. We have verified our views by first analyzing the causes of non-Darcy flow,\nand then systematically analyzed typical experimental data and correlations in the literature. We\nconclude that TPG does not exist. We also use several counter examples to support our conclusion.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xiukun Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["James J.
