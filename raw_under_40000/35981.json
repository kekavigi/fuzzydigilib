After  highlighting  the  meaning  of  the  term  \u2018symbol\u2019,  the  focus  is  laid  upon  the  symbolist movement and rhetoric rendering the multifarious semiotic interferences between arts, such as: music,  painting,  sculpture.  Then  the  emphasis  is  placed  on  impressionism  as  well  as  on  the  connection  between  symbolism  and  impressionism  as  there  is  an  almost  perfect  overlapping  between  the  two  theories, the impressionist and the symbolist one. A possible explanation of the close connection between the different artistic realms is the artists\u2019 united efforts to discover the essence of existence", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Oana-Andreea Pirnuta [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Anca Badulescu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "symbolism, music, painting, im pressionism, semiotics, interferences", "Sumber": "INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE  of  SCIENTIFIC PAPER  AFASES 2012", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Mar 2019"}
