{"Nomor": 32926, "Judul": "A Review Of The Evidence On The Relation Between Crude Oil Prices And Petroleum Product Prices", "Abstrak": "We review a large body of the empirical literature focusing on the relation between petroleum\nproduct prices and oil prices and discuss the evidence on the direction of causality between crude\noil prices and petroleum product prices. In addition, we survey the literature on the much-debated\nquestion of whether petroleum product prices respond differently to increases versus decreases in\noil prices, which Bacon (1991) labeled the \u201crockets and feathers\u201d phenomenon.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "LOUIS H.
