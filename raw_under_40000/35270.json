{"Nomor": 35270, "Judul": "Confucianism as canonic culture", "Abstrak": "The present article is inspired by Liu\u2019s (2017) idea on how Asian philosophy can, in general, and\nConfucianism, in particular, contribute to psychological science and practice. We first clarify potential\nmisunderstandings of Liu\u2019s (2017) paper as a theoretical argument for indigenous psychology or as a debate on philosophy or the philosophy of science. To interpret and develop Liu\u2019s idea, we then conceptualize the concept of culture as canonic (abstract, philosophical and as it appears in classical books or articles) vs. popular (concrete, experiential and as it appears in people\u2019s daily lives). Further, since Liu\u2019s main point is about canonic rather than popular culture, we focus on canonic culture and propose three principles of it, namely the principle of diversity, the principle of hermeneutics and the principle of inspiration. These principles respectively reveal the characteristics, the interpretation process and the beneficial function of a canonic culture like Confucianism", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Tian Xie [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["De-chao Su and Nian Zhong"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "canonic culture, Confucianism, indigenous psychology, popular culture", "Sumber": "Asian Journal of Social Psychology (2017), 20 , 170\u2013175", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Feb 2019"}
