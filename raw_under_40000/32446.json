{"Nomor": 32446, "Judul": "Designing for Big Area Additive Manufacturing", "Abstrak": "Additive manufacturing (AM), more commonly referred to as 3D printing, is revolutionizing the manufacturing\nindustry. With any new technology comes new rules and guidelines for the optimal use of said technology. Big\nArea Additive Manufacturing (BAAM), developed by Cincinnati Incorporated and Oak Ridge National\nLaboratory\n\u2019\ns Manufacturing Demonstration Facility, requires a host of new design parameters compared to\nsmall-scale 3D printing to create large-scale parts. However, BAAM also creates new possibilities in material\ntesting and various applications in the manufacturing industry. Most of the design constraints of small-scale\npolymer 3D printers still apply to BAAM. Beyond those constraints, new rules and limitations exist because\nBAAM\n\u2019\ns large-scale system signi\nfi\ncantly changes the thermal properties associated with small-scale AM. This\nwork details both physical and software-related design considerations for additive manufacturing. After reading\nthis guide, one will have a better understanding of slicing software\n\u2019\ns capabilities and limitations, di\nff\nerent\nphysical characteristics of design and how to apply them appropriately for AM, and how to take the inherent\nnature of AM into consideration during the design process", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Alex Roschili [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Katherine T.
