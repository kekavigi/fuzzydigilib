{"Nomor": 36356, "Judul": "Generative Art Images by Complex Functions Based Genetic Algorithm", "Abstrak": "This paper presents a novel computer supported design system\nwhich uses computational approach to producing 3D images for stimulating\ncreativity of designers. It put forward generic algorithm based on a binary tree\nto generate 3D images. This approach is illustrated by an artwork design\nexample, which uses general complex function expressions to form 3D images\nof artistic flowers. It shows that approach is able to generate some innovative\nsolutions and demonstrates the power of computational approach.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hong Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiyu Liu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Architectural structure", "Kata Kunci": "Generative Art Images, Functions Based Genetic, Algorithm", "Sumber": "Liu, H., Liu, X., 2007, in IFIP International Federation for Information Processing, Volume 250, Trends in Computer Aided Innovation, ed.
