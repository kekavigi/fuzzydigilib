In this paper we present a new method based on a mixed space- and wavenumber-propagator that overcome these issues very effectively as demonstrated by the examples. The pioneering methods of phase-shift (PS) and Stolt migration in the frequency-wavenumber domain designed for laterally homogeneous media have been followed by several extensions for laterally inhomogeneous media. Referred many times to as phase-screen or generalized phase-screen methods, such extensions include as main examples of the Split-step Fourier (SSF) and the phase-shift plus interpolation (PSPI). To further refine such phase-screen techniques, we introduce a higher-order extension to SSF valid for a 3D VTI medium with large lateral contrasts in vertical velocity and anisotropy parameters. The method is denoted Fourier Mixed-Domain (FMD) prestack depth migration and can be regarded as a stable explicit algorithm. The FMD technique was tested using the 3D SEG/EAGE salt model and the 2D anisotropic Hess model with good results. Finally, FMD was applied with success to a 3D field data set from the Barents Sea including anisotropy.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP H ZHAO 1": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170455"}, "Penulis": "Zhao, H.
