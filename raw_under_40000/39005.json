{"Nomor": 39005, "Judul": "Design Considerations for Electrode Buffer Layer Materials in Polymer Solar Cells", "Abstrak": "Electrode buffer layers in polymer-based photovoltaic devices enable highly efficient devices. In the absence of\nbuffer layers, we show that diode rectification is lost in ITO/\nP3HT:PCBM/Ag (ITO = indium tin oxide; P3HT = poly(3-\nhexylthiophene); PCBM = phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester)\ndevices due to nonselective charge injection through the\npercolated phase pathways of a bulk heterojunction active layer.\nCharge-selective injection, and thus rectification and device\nfunction, can be regained by placing thin, polymeric buffer layers\nthat break the direct electrode-active layer contact. Additionally,\nwe show that strong active layer?buffer layer interactions lead to\nunwanted vertical phase separation and a kinked current?voltage\ncurve. Device function is regained, increasing power conversion efficiency from 3.6% to 7.2%, by placing a noninteracting layer\nbetween the buffer and active layer. These results guide the design and selection of future polymeric electrode buffer layers for\nefficient polymer solar cell devices.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP David Bilby 1.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170790"}, "Penulis": "David Bilby [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Bradley Frieberg, Shobhita Kramadhati,Peter Green,Jinsang Kim"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "polymer photovoltaic, electrode interface", "Sumber": "www.acsami.org   dx.doi.org/10.1021/am502673e | ACS Appl.
