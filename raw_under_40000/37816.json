Visual images germane to the topic of ceramics from China had already been in widespread circulation by this  time.  Moreover,  some  of  the  most  prominent  examples  of  such illustrations  were  already  a  global  phenomenon:  woodblock  prints  of ceramic  production  that  appeared  in  technical  manuals  sketched  in Jingdezhen,  China,  were  also  bought  and  sold  as  export  watercolors and wallpapers, displayed and used in East Asia as well as Europe.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ellen C.
