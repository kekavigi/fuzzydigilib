{"Nomor": 32499, "Judul": "Evidence for horizontal transfer of mitochondrial DNA to the plastid genome in a bamboo genus", "Abstrak": "In flowering plants, three genomes (nuclear, mitochondrial, and plastid) coexist and intracellular\nhorizontal transfer of DNA is prevalent, especially from the plastid to the mitochondrion genome.\nHowever, the plastid genomes are generally conserved in evolution and have long been considered\nimmune to foreign DNA. Recently, the opposite direction of DNA transfer from the mitochondrial to\nthe plastid genome has been reported in two eudicot lineages. Here we sequenced 6 plastid genomes\nof bamboos, three of which are neotropical woody species and three are herbaceous ones. Several\nunusual features were found, including the duplication of trnT-GGU and loss of one copy of rps19 due\nto contraction of inverted repeats (IRs). The most intriguing was the ~2.7kb insertion in the plastid\nIR regions in the three herbaceous bamboos. Furthermore, the insertion was documented to be\nhorizontally transferred from the mitochondrial to the plastid genome. Our study provided evidence\nof the mitochondrial-to-plastid DNA transfer in the monocots, demonstrating again that this rare\nevent does occur in other angiosperm lineages. However, the mechanism underlying the transfer\nremains obscure, and more studies in other plants may elucidate it in the future.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "PENG-FEI MA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["YU-XIAO ZHANG"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Architecture", "Kata Kunci": "Plastid genome, bamboo", "Sumber": "www.nature.com/scientificreports", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
