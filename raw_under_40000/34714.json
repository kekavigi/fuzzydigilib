{"Nomor": 34714, "Judul": "TRANSITION IN SWIMMING DIRECTION IN A MODEL SELF-PROPELLED INERTIAL SWIMMER", "Abstrak": "We propose a reciprocal, self-propelled model swimmer at intermediate Reynolds\nnumbers (Re). Our swimmer consists of two unequal spheres that oscillate in antiphase,\ngenerating nonlinear steady streaming (SS) flows. We show computationally that the SS\nflows enable the swimmer to propel itself, and also switch direction as Re increases. We\nquantify the transition in the swimming direction by collapsing our data on a critical Re\nand show that the transition in swimming directions corresponds to the reversal of the SS\nflows. Based on our findings, we propose that SS can be an important physical mechanism\nfor motility at intermediate Re.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "THOMAS DOMBROWSKI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["SHANNON K.
