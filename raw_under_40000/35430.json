{"Nomor": 35430, "Judul": "Neurological Effect of the Aesthetics of Product  Design on the Decision-making Process of  Consumers", "Abstrak": "To  analyze  the  neurological  effect  of  product design  aesthetics  on  the  decision-making process  of  consumers. Twenty-three undergraduates are selected for the study and 16 products with a total of 96 pictures of  productdesign  were  judged.  The  P2  wave  in  the  cortex  of  the  cerebral  parietal  region  can  reflect  consumers'  aesthetic experience of product design. Studies related to fMRI have shown that sculptures presented in the original scale induce the activation of the insula and parietal region cortex (precuneus), indicating that this part of brain region plays an important role in the aesthetic experience of art works. When the aesthetic attraction of product design is high,  the  conflict  will  reduce  consumers'  aesthetic experience  of  the  product  and  thus  reduce  the  confirmed purchase  rate  of  the  product.  When  the  attraction  of  product  design  is  moderate,  the  conflict  will  enhance consumers' aesthetic experience of the product, which will increase the confirmed purchase rate of the product.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yakun Chen [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Product Design Aesthetics, Decision-making Process  of Consumers, Neurological Effect", "Sumber": "NeuroQuantology | June 2018 | Volume 16 | Issue 6 |  Page 501-506 | doi: 10.14704/nq.2018.16.6.1675", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Feb 2019"}
