{"Nomor": 37502, "Judul": "Realizing 20% External Quantum Efficiency in Electroluminescencewith Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence from anExciplex", "Abstrak": "he investigation of nondoped exciplex blends of 2,4,6-tris[3-(diphenylphosphinyl)phenyl]-1,3,5-triazine (PO-T2T), working asthe one-electron acceptor molecule, with different electron donors isreported. The emissions of these exciplexes span from the blue to orange-red regions, showing clear contribution from thermally activated delayedfluorescence (TADF) and delayedfluorescence originated from non-geminate recombination of charge carriers created by the dissociation ofoptically generated exciplexes. We focus our studies on the properties ofTADF in these systems, covering in particular the physical meaning of thedifferent transient components observed in their luminescence decays. Ourresults unravel the intricate role of reverse intersystem crossing due tospin?orbit coupling and possibly also due to hyperfine interactions and internal conversion, which affect the efficiency of theTADF mechanism. Remarkable performances are obtained in prototype organic light-emitting diodes fabricated with some ofthese blends. Green exciplex blends, in particular, exhibited the current efficiency of 60 cd A?1, power efficiency of 71 lm W?1,and external quantum efficiency of 20%. We believe that our results will contribute significantly to highlight the potentialadvantages of intermolecular exciplexes in the area of organic light-emitting diodes", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Marian_Chapran_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164750"}, "Penulis": "Marian Chapran [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Piotr Pander,Marharyta Vasylieva,Gabriela Wiosna-Salyga,Jacek Ulanski,Fernando B.
