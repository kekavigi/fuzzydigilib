{"Nomor": 35698, "Judul": "Experimental investigation and techno-economic analysis of tetramethylammonium hydroxide removal from wastewater in nano-electronics manufacturing via membrane distillation", "Abstrak": "In nano-electronics manufacturing, tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) is extensively used in the etching process,\nleading to a waste disposal issue. The present study focuses on TMAH wastewater treatment in nano-electronics industries\nby using membrane distillation technology. Actual TMAH wastewater samples were collected at imec, Belgium. An air gap\nmembrane distillation bench unit was employed to perform the experiments for different operating conditions i.e., feed\ntemperatures and flow rates. High quality water is recovered after reducing the TMAH concentration to 1ppm and lowering\nthe TOC to 0.8 ppm from 8 ppm. For the industrial scale TMAH wastewater treatment, industrial waste heat driven and\ndistrict heating driven membrane distillation systems are designed and analyzed. It is determined that 14 GWh thermal\nenergy is required to treat 20,000 m3\n of TMAH wastewater/year while considering 65?C as the membrane distillation feed\ntemperature. Expected unit water treatment cost is found as low as 16 $/m3\n of TMAH wastewater, roughly 80% lower than\ncurrent disposal costs.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Imtisal-e-Noor, [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jan Coenen., Andrew Martin., Olli Dahl.,Miriam \u00c5slin"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Membrane distillation, Techno-economic analysis, Tetramethylammonium hydroxide, Wastewater, Waste heat", "Sumber": "Accepted Manuscript", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Feb 2019"}
