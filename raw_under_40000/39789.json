{"Nomor": 39789, "Judul": "SPECTROFLUOROMETRIC DETERMINATION OF TRYPTOPHAN IN CANARY (CANARIUM INDICUM L.) PROTEIN HYDROLYSATE", "Abstrak": "Canary (Canarium indicum L.) is an indigenous plant of Indonesia, which mainly\ngrows in the eastern part of Indonesia, especially in the Maluku, North Sulawesi,\nand Seram islands. Researches on canary seeds had been done to determine lipid,\nprotein and amino acids contents. To the best of our knowledge, no scientific reports\nhave been conducted about tryptophan content in Canarium indicum. Therefore,\nthis study was conducted to determine the presence and quantitate the aromatic\namino acid (tryptophan) in the canary protein hydrolysate by the\nspectrofluorometric method. The protein hydrolysate was prepared by two\nhydrolysis methods, enzymatic and alkaline hydrolysis using the purple fruit (adult\nfruit) as a starting material. Fluorescence detection is fast and more sensitive and\nhas less interfering compounds than those of ultraviolet detection (UV). In addition,\ntryptophan and tyrosine can be excited at the same wavelength around 280nm, but\nthey have a different emission wavelength, around 350 nm, and 300 nm\nrespectively, so tryptophan can be differentiated from tyrosine directly without\nusing of any reagent by excitation of the sample at 295 nm in order to avoid tyrosine\nemission. This method had an exceptional specificity to overcome the presence of\ntyrosine, which may be expected to be present in the sample matrix. A proportional\nrelationship between the increase in fluorescence intensity and tryptophan\nconcentration in the range 0.5-5 ppm was obtained with a calibration curve\ncorrelation equation y = 6632.3x - 845.42 and correlation coefficient of 0.9997,\nwhile the coefficient of variance in linear regression was 1.29%. The detection limit\nand quantification limit obtained were 0.116 ppm and 0.35 ppm respectively. The\nrecoveries of the accuracy test were obtained in the range of 95-96%. The relative\nstandard deviation of intra-assay precision tests was obtained in the range of 0.5-\n1.8%, while the intermediate precision in the range of 2.18-3.74%. The samples\nused in this study were papain, pepsin, and alkaline canary protein hydrolysate.\nTryptophan was detected in all samples (papain, pepsin, and alkaline hydrolysate),\nwith concentrations 5.58, 5 and 1.47 mg/100mg of protein respectively. The used\nfluorimetric method complied the validation requirements and can be used to\nanalyze tryptophan in samples containing tyrosine without overlapping of spectra\nand without the use of any specific reagent.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Ismail Miftah Abotbina": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/172972", "COVER Ismail Miftah Abotbina": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/243124", "BAB 1 Ismail Miftah Abotbina": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/243125", "BAB 2 Ismail Miftah Abotbina": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/243126", "BAB 3 Ismail Miftah Abotbina": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/243127", "BAB 4 Ismail Miftah Abotbina": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/243128", "BAB 5 Ismail Miftah Abotbina": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/243129", "BAB 6 Ismail Miftah Abotbina": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/243130", "PUSTAKA Ismail Miftah Abotbina": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/243131"}, "Penulis": "Ismail Miftah Abotbina [20717701]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Tutus Gusdinar Kartawinata, MS", "Dr. Ilma Nugrahani, M.Si., Apt."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Farmasi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Farmasi", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Canarium, Tryptophan, Spectrofluorometric", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana \u00a0\n                                     yana mulyana", "File": "9 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Jun 2019"}
