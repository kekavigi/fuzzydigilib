This is done by doing a\ncase study on the Dubrovnik Riviera, where we tested our concepts, ideas and methods in\npractice. During the case study we used participation, the layer approach of de Hoog and Sijmons\n(1996) and the landscape approach of Koh (2010) as our main methods.\nApproach \u2013 Using the local landscape and culture as base and inspiration for the development of\nsustainable tourism. Combined with tourism trends and the input of local stakeholders we\nworked out a spatial plan.\nFindings \u2013 The landscape including natural and cultural qualities can serve as a perfect base for\nthe development of new forms of sustainable tourism:\n? A touristic region should function as a system, where all villages are working together adding\nsomething unique to the whole system\n? An efficient extensive public transport network and zoning can help developing a region\nsustainable\n? A combination between a bottom-up and top-down approach is needed to implement\nsustainable tourism, creating preconditions for each other to function optimally.\nSo, we can conclude that a landscape-based design approach gives a significant new insight in\nhow sustainable tourism can be developed in practice.\nThe originality of this research \u2013 The landscape architecture approach fills the gap between ideas\nabout sustainable tourism and the practical applicability of it. Using the local landscape and\nculture sets a sustainable framework for developing sustainable tourism and results in a working\ntourism system led by the local community. Using landscape architecture in sustainable tourism\ndevelopment is a new, but very interesting and promising addition to the current research and\nconcrete development.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jesper Borsje [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ruud Tak"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "landscape architecture, participation, multi-scale, design, integral, landscape", "Sumber": "Tourism and Hospitality Management, Vol. 19, No. 1, pp. 65-82, 2013", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Mar 2019"}
