{"Nomor": 38947, "Judul": "Investigation of movement and damage of integral overburden during shallow coal seam mining", "Abstrak": "Most prediction methods used to calculate mining-induced subsidence are empirical, which cannot explain the\nmechanism of fundamental rock strata movement. In this paper, based on key stratum theory and the mechanical\nanalysis of overburden, a new analytical solution, the Analogous Hyperbola Subsidence Model (AHSM), was\nproposed to describe the movement and damage of inner burden. Mining-induced rock strata movement was\nverified using the Distinct Element Method (UDEC), to assess the performance of the theoretical model. Three\nsubsidence parameters (Smax/T, Sgoaf/Smax, D/H), generally used to describe surface subsidence trough, agree\nwith statistical field measurements of the South Coalfield in Australia. The surface subsidence and the movement\nboundary in the overburden are very close to the theoretical predictions. Additionally, the primary key stratum\ndamages the least in the overlying strata: its broken length is the smallest. The width of subsidence trough and\nmaximum surface subsidence increase as the primary key stratum drops.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yunjiang Sun [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jianping Zuo, Murat Karakus , Jintao Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Mining-induced subsidence, Analogous hyperbola subsidence model, Key stratum theory, Primary key stratum Integral overburden, Shallow coal mining", "Sumber": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrmms.2019.03.019", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani \u00a0\n                                     Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Jun 2019"}
