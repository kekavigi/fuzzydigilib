{"Nomor": 38235, "Judul": "Entanglement Spreading in a Minimal Model of Maximal Many-Body Quantum Chaos", "Abstrak": "The spreading of entanglement in out-of-equilibrium quantum systems is currently at the center of\nintense interdisciplinary research efforts involving communities with interests ranging from holography to\nquantum information. Here we provide a constructive and mathematically rigorous method to compute the\nentanglement dynamics in a class of \u201cmaximally chaotic,\u201d periodically driven, quantum spin chains.\nSpecifically, we consider the so-called \u201cself-dual\u201d kicked Ising chains initialized in a class of separable\nstates and devise a method to compute exactly the time evolution of the entanglement entropies of finite\nblocks of spins in the thermodynamic limit. Remarkably, these exact results are obtained despite the\nmaximally chaotic models considered: Their spectral correlations are described by the circular orthogonal\nensemble of random matrices on all scales. Our results saturate the so-called \u201cminimal cut\u201d bound and are in agreement with those found in the contexts of random unitary circuits with infinite-dimensional local\nHilbert space and conformal field theory. In particular, they agree with the expectations from both the\nquasiparticle picture, which accounts for the entanglement spreading in integrable models, and the minimal membrane picture, recently proposed to describe the entanglement growth in generic systems. Based on a novel \u201cduality-based\u201d numerical method, we argue that our results describe the entanglement spreading from any product state at the leading order in time when the model is nonintegrable.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Bruno Bertin [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pavel Kos,", "and Toma\u017e Prosen"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW X 9, 021033 (2019); Published by the American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Mei 2019"}
