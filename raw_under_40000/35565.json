{"Nomor": 35565, "Judul": "Study on the influence and mechanism of sodium chlorate on COD reduction of minerals processing wastewater", "Abstrak": "In current COD measurement method, we found that sodium chlorate (NaClO3) can effectively reduce the\nchemical oxygen demand (COD) of minerals processing wastewater (MPW). However, the reduction in COD via\nthe present COD method was only achieved through the interference of NaClO3 with COD measurement. A series\nof laboratory-scale experiments demonstrated that the COD reduction is independent of NaClO3 reaction time,\nreaction pH and reaction temperature, but only related to NaClO3 dosage, and a higher NaClO3 dosage leads to a\nlower COD. Results further showed that the addition of NaClO3 didn\u2019t affect the initial concentration of the total\norganic carbon, chloride ions and the benzohydroxamic acid (BHA); their concentration remained unchanged\nafter the addition of NaClO3. Moreover, the residual concentration of NaClO3 also remained same as the initial\nvalue. However, COD in both MPW and BHA solution decreased. Furthermore, when added reducing agent to\nconsume the residual NaClO3 before COD measurement, and then the COD was determined to return to its initial\nvalue. All these observations clearly shown that NaClO3 doesn\u2019t react with the reducing substances in wastewater under the experimental conditions; it only reacts with reducing substances under the COD measurement\nconditions. From all these evidences, we concluded that NaClO3 can interfere with the determination of COD. In\nfact, the interference of NaClO3 is not specified in the standard method, which is a defect of the present COD\nmeasurement method. Residual NaClO3 remains in wastewater may cause secondary pollution to the environment. This study, therefore, suggest the government revise and improve the COD measurement method in order\nto avoid the interference of NaClO3 and prevent the industrial use of NaClO3 for COD reduction of wastewater.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xiangsong Meng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sultan Ahmed Khoso., Fei Lyu.,Jiangqiu Wu., Jianhua Kang.,Hang Liu.,Qingpeng Zhang.,Haisheng Han.,Wei Sun.,Yuehua Hu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "COD Sodium chlorate Minerals processing wastewater COD measurement method", "Sumber": "Minerals Engineering 134 (2019) 1\u20136", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Feb 2019"}
