{"Nomor": 33359, "Judul": "Investigation of an Ordovician carbonate mound beneath Gotland, Sweden, using 3D seismic and well data", "Abstrak": "The Swedish island of Gotland is located within the Baltic Basin. During the Late Ordovician the\nregion around Gotland was part of a shallow epicratonic basin in the southern subtropics. In these\nwarm-water environments algae flourished, diverse reefs developed close to the coastline and\nfurther outboard carbonate mounds developed. These mounds formed rigid high relief structures\nsurrounded by fine-grained siliciclastics and marls and can be detected on seismic images as\nisolated concave upwards features. The sedimentary succession beneath Gotland was intensely\ninvestigated in the 1970s and 1980s for its hydrocarbon potential, and subsequently, oil was\ncommercially produced from reservoirs within Ordovician mounds. In 1981, a 3D seismic survey\nwas conducted by Horizon Exploration Ltd over the Fardume mound on northern Gotland. To\ndate no results from these 3D data have been published in scientific literature.\nThe region of Gotland aims to produce 100 % of its energy from renewable sources and currently\nthe majority of Gotland\u2019s energy is provided by wind turbines. Due to the intermittent nature of\nwind power, one solution to regulate the supply of electricity from wind energy is Compressed\nAir Energy Storage (CAES).\nIn this study, we convert the 3D seismic survey acquired over the Fardume mound from scanned\nTIFF images to SEGY format. These data are then utilized together with well data to gain a better\nknowledge of the geological structure of the mound and to examine its reservoir characteristics\nand potential for CAES. To date, carbonate mounds on Gotland have mainly been reported in the\nscientific literature using well data. This 3D seismic survey, therefore, provides a rare\nopportunity to better characterize and investigate the structure of one of the carbonate mounds on\nGotland.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Tegan Levendal [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Daniel Sopher, Christopher Juhlin, Oliver Lehnert"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Sweden; Gotland; carbonate mounds; Late Ordovician; OPAB dataset; seismic interpretation; 3D seismic; CAES", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics, S0926-9851(18)30814-0 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2019.01.008", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Jan 2019"}
