{"Nomor": 33097, "Judul": "Behavioral determinants of proclaimed support for environment protection policies", "Abstrak": "Using a representative survey of German university students, we confirm that proclaimed support\nfor environment protection policies depends on socio-cultural factors and political ideology.\nUnlike most related studies for other countries, we find that the environmental policy stance of\nGerman partisans does not follow the left-right cleavage. Only about 25% of the social-democratic\npartisans wholeheartedly support environment protection policies, whereas 50% of the green\npartisans, who, in Germany, also belong to the political left, do so; and when controlling for sociocultural influences, social-democratic partisans become undistinguishable from Christianconservative and market-oriented partisans. Focusing on behavioral influences, we find that\nsome of the respondents' psychological traits are not filtered through their political ideology but\ndirectly influence their proclaimed attitudes towards environment protection policies. We identify\nas important behavioral determinants the locus of control and psychological traits that capture the\nrespondents' susceptibility to making use of expressive rhetoric.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Bjorn Kauder [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Niklas Potrafke .,Heinrich Ursprung"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Environment protection Political preferences Ideology Identity Expressive behavior", "Sumber": "European Journal of Political Economy 54 (2018) 26\u201341", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Jan 2019"}
