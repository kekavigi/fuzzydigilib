The idea is based on the modulation of thrust reversers\ninstalledontheaircraft.Todemonstratetheefficiencyofsuch asystem, thecompleteequationsofmotion\nas soon as the main gears touch the ground, up until the aircraft comes to a complete stop have been\ndeveloped. In addition to the thrust reversers, all effective control mechanisms during the landing process,\nsuch as brakes and spoilers have been included in the mathematical model.
