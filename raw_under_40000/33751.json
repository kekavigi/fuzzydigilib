{"Nomor": 33751, "Judul": "Fluorescent Patterns by Selective Grafting of a Telechelic Polymer", "Abstrak": "The preparation of patterned ultrathin films (sub-10 nm) composed of end-anchored fluorescently labeled poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is presented. Telechelic PMMA was synthesized utilizing activator regenerated by electron transfer atom transfer radical polymerization and consecutively end-functionalized with alkynylated fluorescein by Cu-catalyzed azide?alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) chemistry. The polymers were grafted via the ?-carboxyl groups to silica or glass substrates pretreated with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES). Patterned surfaces were prepared by inkjet printing of APTES onto glass substrates and selectively grafted with fluorescently end-labeled PMMA to obtain emissive arrays on the surface.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Maciej Kopec [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sinem Tas, Marco Cirelli, Rianne van der Pol, Ilse de Vries, G.
