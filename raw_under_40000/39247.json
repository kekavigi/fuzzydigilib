{"Nomor": 39247, "Judul": "PROGRESSIVE FAILURE ANALYSIS ON COMPOSITE SINGLE LAP BOLTED JOINTS USING XFEM", "Abstrak": "The unrelenting passion of aerospace and automotive industry to enhance the\nperformance of aircraft and automotive are constantly driving the development of\nimproved high-performance structural material. Composites material are one such\nclass of material that play a significant role in current and future aerospace and\nautomotive component. One of the main attractions to composite materials is that\nthey\u2019re extremely lightweight, 30% lighter than aluminum and 25% the weight of\nsteel. Carbon-Fiber-Reinforced plastic (CFRP) and Glass-Fiber-Reinforced\nplastic (GFRP) are usually used to make a component. Both of which are stiff and\nstrong. Bolted joints are common mechanical fastened joint use for joining the\ncomposite part. It is unavoidable in complex structures because of their low cost,\nsimplicity and facilitation of disassembly for repair. Bolted joints require holes in\nthe composite structure. These holes cause large stress concentrations, decrease\nthe load holding capacity and increase the complexity of the numerical analysis\nIn this study, the composite CFRP woven fabric single-lap bolted joint is taken into\naccount to analyze the failure mechanisms and failure load of composite structures.\nExperiments of single-lap bolted joints is conducted to study the progressive failure\nbehavior of bolted joint structure. To validate experiment results, a traction \u2013\nseparation law is used as a constitutive model and is implemented within Extended\nFinite Element Method (XFEM) approach to predict bearing stress at failure and\ntrack the propagation of the crack. The approach is based on an assumption that\ndamage in composite hole structure initiates and propagates from the hole in a selfsimilar\nfashion. To analyze the influence of parameters of composite plate on the\nfailure, the three parameters to be considered are: width, thickness and stacking\nsequence. Effect of clamp-up torque in bolted joint also conduct to study the\ninfluence of this value to the strength of joint structure. Good agreement of bearing\nstrength prediction of single-lap bolted joints can be seen at most of geometric\nconfiguration between experimental and simulation results (below 20 percent) and\nthe bearing failure observed in experiments could not be treated in current study.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Nguyen Anh Tuan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/171355"}, "Penulis": "Nguyen Anh Tuan [23617702]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
