{"Nomor": 34111, "Judul": "Community Building as Pedagogy in Art History", "Abstrak": "Etienne Wenger discusses two scenarios of socially defined competence or\nsocial learning, wherein our experiences and engagement with others around\nus inform what and how we learn.1 In one scenario Wenger describes tire\nexperience of one who is already competent and enmeshed in a particular\ncommunity for many years. She is comfortable and is considered competent\namong her peers in her community. Then this same individual, a scholar, for\nexample, is introduced to a new community at an academic conference or\nthrough discussions with peers from other disciplines. These disciplines\n(communities) have different practices, different definitions of competency,\nand different perspectives. The experience of engaging with these different\nperspectives and competencies challenges what her \"home community\"\ndefines as competency.2 Inspired and challenged, she applies her experiences\nto her practice and tries to redefine her competence in her home discipline\u2014\nher community. According to Wenger, she is using her experience to pull\ncompetency of one community to another.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Rebecka A.
