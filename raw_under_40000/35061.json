{"Nomor": 35061, "Judul": "Solid Amine Sorbents For CO2 Capture By Chemical Adsorption: A Review", "Abstrak": "Amines are well-known for their reversible reactions with CO2, which make them ideal for CO2\ncapture from several gas streams, including flue gas. In this respect, selective CO2 absorption by\naqueous alkanolamines is the most mature technology but the process is energy intensive and has\nalso corrosion problems. Both disadvantages can be diminished to a certain extent by chemical\nadsorption of CO2 selectively. The most important element of the chemical adsorption of CO2 involves the design and development of a suitable adsorbent which consist of a porous support onto\nwhich an amine is attached or immobilized. Such an adsorbent is often called as solid amine\nsorbent. This review covers solid amine-based studies which are developed and published in recent\nyears. First, the review examines several different types of porous support materials, namely, three\nmesoporous silica (MCM-41, SBA-15 and KIT-6) and two polymeric supports (PMMA and PS) for CO2\nadsorption. Emphasis is given to the synthesis, modifications and characterizations -such as BET\nand PXRD data-of them. Amination of these supports to obtain a solid amine sorbent through\nimpregnation or grafting is reviewed comparatively. Focus is given to the adsorption mechanisms,\nmaterial characteristics, and synthesis methods which are discussed in detail. Significant amount of\noriginal data are also presented which makes this review unique. Finally, relevant CO2 adsorption\n(or equilibrium) capacity data, and cyclic adsorption/desorption performance and stability of\nimportant classes of solid amine sorbents are critically reviewed. These include severa PEI or TEPA\nimpregnated adsorbents and APTES-grafted systems", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ELIF ERDAL \u00dcNVEREN  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Bahar Ozmen Monkul", "erife Sar?oglan", "Nesrin Karademir", "Erdogan Alper"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Amine-impregnation, Amine-grafting, CO2 capture, Chemical adsorption, Mesoporous silica, Solid amine sorbent, Polymeric support, Temperature swing adsorption", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 3, Issue 1, Pages 37-50 (March 2017)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Feb 2019"}
