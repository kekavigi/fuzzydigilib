Results showed that through adding scaling agent,\nscale was formed because of the reaction between scaling agent and Ca2+, Mg2+ in the flooding water,\nwhich could enhance the viscosity of polymer solution. Through comparing the resistance factor and\nresidual resistance factor of polymer solution which was respectively prepared with flooding water,\nsoftened water and scale, the resistance factor and residual resistance factor of polymer solution with\nscale was the largest, that of polymer solution prepared with softened water was second and that of\npolymer solution prepared with flooding water came last. Furthermore, scaling agent weakened the\ngelling effect between cross-linking agent Cr3+ and polymer molecule chains. The earlier the crosslinking agent Cr3+ was added, the larger the polymer viscosity, resistance factor and residual resistance factor of Cr3+ polymer were", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SHENGWANG YUAN [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Seepage characteristic, Water disposal, Scaling agent, Resistance factor and residual resistance factor", "Sumber": "Petroleum 4 (2018) 50-55 - KeAi, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2017.09.003", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Jan 2019"}
