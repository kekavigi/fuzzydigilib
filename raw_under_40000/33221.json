{"Nomor": 33221, "Judul": "Structures of an RNA polymerase promoter melting intermediate elucidate DNA unwinding", "Abstrak": "A key regulated step of transcription is promoter melting by RNA\npolymerase (RNAP) to form the open promoter complex1\u20133. To\ngenerate the open complex, the conserved catalytic core of the RNAP\ncombines with initiation factors to locate promoter DNA, unwind\n12\u201314 base pairs of the DNA duplex and load the template-strand\nDNA into the RNAP active site. Formation of the open complex\nis a multi-step process during which transient intermediates of\nunknown structure are formed4\u20136. Here we present cryo-electron\nmicroscopy structures of bacterial RNAP\u2013promoter DNA\ncomplexes, including structures of partially melted intermediates.\nThe structures show that late steps of promoter melting occur within\nthe RNAP cleft, delineate key roles for fork-loop 2 and switch 2\u2014\nuniversal structural features of RNAP\u2014in restricting access of DNA\nto the RNAP active site, and explain why clamp opening is required\nto allow entry of single-stranded template DNA into the active\nsite. The key roles of fork-loop 2 and switch 2 suggest a common\nmechanism for late steps in promoter DNA opening to enable gene\nexpression across all domains of life.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hande Boyaci1 [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["James Chen1, Rolf Jansen2, Seth A.
