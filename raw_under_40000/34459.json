{"Nomor": 34459, "Judul": "Optimization Of Huff-N-Puff Gas Injection In Shale Oil Reservoirs", "Abstrak": "Earlier studies show that huff-n-puff injection is preferred to continuous gas flooding to improve\nliquid oil production in shale oil reservoirs. Compared to gas flooding, huff-n-puff has more\noperational parameters to optimize so that liquid oil production can be maximized. This paper is to\ndiscuss the optimum huff-n-puff times, number of cycles and soaking time under practical operational and reservoir conditions. The operational and reservoir conditions dictate the maximum\ninjection and production rates, and the maximum injection pressure and minimum production\npressure.\nThe numerical simulation results and discussions show that the optimum huff time is so long\nthat the pressure near the wellbore reaches the set maximum injection pressure during the huff\nperiod; and the optimum puff time is the time required for the pressure near the wellbore to reach\nthe set minimum production pressure during the puff period. The benefits of soaking may not\ncompensate the loss in injection and production due to the time lost in the soaking period.\nTherefore, soaking may not be necessary during the huff-n-puff gas injection in shale oil reservoirs.\nThe number of huff-n-puff cycles is determined when an economic rate cut-off is reached.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "JAMES J.
