{"Nomor": 37818, "Judul": "BUCKLING AND POSTBUCKLING ANALYSIS OF ELASTO-PLASTIC FIBERMETAL LAMINATES", "Abstrak": "The elasto-plastic buckling and postbuckling of fiber metal laminates (FML) are\nstudied in this research. Considering the geometric nonlinearity of the structure and the elastoplastic\ndeformation of themetal layers, the incremental VonKarman geometric relation of theFML\nwith initial deflection is established. Moreover, an incremental elasto-plastic constitutive relation\nadopting the mixed hardening rule is introduced to depict the stress-strain relationship of the\nmetal layers. Subsequently, the incremental nonlinear governing equations of the FML subjected\nto in-plane compressive loads are derived, and the whole problem is solved by the iterative method\naccording to the finite differencemethod. In numerical examples, the effects of the initial deflection,\nthe loading state, and the geometric parameters on the elasto-plastic buckling and postbuckling\nof FML are investigated, respectively.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Rengui Bi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yiming Fu, Yanping Tian, Chao Jiang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "fiber metal laminates, elasto-plastic, buckling, postbuckling", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Apr 2019"}
