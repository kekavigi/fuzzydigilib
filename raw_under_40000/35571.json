The\nmicrobeads (MBs) used in cosmetics and discharged into the sewer systems after use cause substantial\nmicroplastics pollution in the receiving waters. Today, the use of plastic microbeads in cosmetics is\nbanned. The existing use cases are to be discontinued within a few years. Yet, there are no restrictions\nregarding the use of microbeads in a number of industries, cleaning products, pharmaceuticals and\nmedical practices. In this context, the determination and classification of MBs which had so far been\ndischarged to water sources and which continue to be discharged, represent crucial problems. In this\nwork, we examined a new approach for the classification of MBs based on microscopic images. For\nclassification purposes, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) -a Deep Learning algorithm- was employed,\nwhereas GoogLeNet architecture served as the model. The network is built from scratch, and trained then\nafter tested on a total of 42928 images containing MBs in 5 distinct cleansers. The study performed with\nthe CNN which achieved a classification performance of 89% for MBs in wastewater.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Meral Yurtsever [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ulas\u00b8 Yurtsever"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Deep learning Convolutional neural network Microbeads classification Microplastics Wastewater", "Sumber": "Chemosphere 216 (2019) 271e280", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Feb 2019"}
