This thematic review considers three recent works  addressing the US/Mexico border made by or in collaboration with anthropologists. The first two were public exhibitions, \nFencing In Democracy at apexart gallery in New York City and States of Exception/Estado de \nExcepci\u00f3n  at  The  New  School  in  New  York  City,  while  the  third is the film El mar la mar\n(dirs. Bonnetta and Sniadecki 2017).", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Amahl Bishara [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Naomi Schiller"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Installation Art, democracy, exhibition", "Sumber": "Visual Anthropology Review.
