{"Nomor": 34901, "Judul": "Picasso Sculpture", "Abstrak": "Throughout his career Pablo Picasso worked prolifically in producing three- as well as two-dimensional art. While his drawings, paintings, and prints have attracted more scholarly attention (and higher auction prices) than his sculptures, his developments in the latter have influenced other artists and reflected the spirit of improvisation in 20th-century modernism. Incorporating collage into his paintings, Picasso also introduced commercially produced objects into his sculptures\u2014absinthe spoons, baskets, nuts, bolts. He painted on bronze or sheet-metal sculptures and formed motifs taken from his canvases. Museum of Modern Art curators Temkin and Anne Umland trace the episodic nature of his output through impressive loans from international collections and insightful catalog essays. The main text offers a detailed chronology by curators Luise Mahler and Virginie Perdrisot in eight chapters, incorporating new archival research to build upon the 2000 catalog raisonn\u00e9 by Werner Spies and Christine Piot. An exhibition checklist, photographs of the sculptures by Hungarian artist Brassa\u00ef, extensive references, and a list of selected public exhibitions before the first sculpture retrospectives in 1966 round out the volume. VERDICT Rich in documentary material and photographs, this exhibition catalog beautifully clarifies the importance of Picasso\u2019s sculpture in his oeuvre and in the larger trajectory of modern art.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "LINDSAY KING [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Sculpture, modern art", "Sumber": "Library Journal. 2/15/2016, Vol. 141 Issue 3, p101-103. 2p", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Feb 2019"}
