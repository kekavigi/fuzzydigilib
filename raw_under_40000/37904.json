{"Nomor": 37904, "Judul": "Exotic Low-Energy Excitations Emergent in the Random Kitaev Magnet Cu2IrO3", "Abstrak": "We report on magnetization M\u00f0H\u00de, dc and ac magnetic susceptibility ?\u00f0T\u00de, specific heat Cm\u00f0T\u00de and\nmuon spin relaxation (?SR) measurements of the Kitaev honeycomb iridate Cu2IrO3 with quenched\ndisorder. In spite of the chemical disorders, we find no indication of spin glass down to 260 mK from\nthe Cm\u00f0T\u00de and ?SR data. Furthermore, a persistent spin dynamics observed by the zero-field muon\nspin relaxation evidences an absence of static magnetism. The remarkable observation is a scaling relation\nof ?\u00bdH; T and M\u00bdH; T in H=T with the scaling exponent ? \u00bc 0.26\u20130.28, expected from bond\nrandomness. However, Cm\u00bdH; T=T disobeys the predicted universal scaling law, pointing towards the\npresence of additional low-lying excitations on the background of bond-disordered spin liquid. Our\nresults signify a many-faceted impact of quenched disorder in a Kitaev spin system due to its peculiar\nbond character.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Y. S.
