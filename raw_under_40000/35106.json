{"Nomor": 35106, "Judul": "Statistical analysis of sustainable production of algal biomass from wastewater treatment process", "Abstrak": "Algal biodiesel is one of the most promising renewable and eco-friendly source of energy for transportation,\nwhen algae is produced from wastewater. During the process, both goals of biodiesel production and wastewater\ntreatment could be achieved simultaneously. However, the optimal condition for algae production remained\nunanswered. Algal biodiesel could be produced from various wastewater treatments. In this study the relationship between biomass production versus lipid productivity in various wastewater sources is statistically\nanalyzed. Chemical oxidation demand, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and CO2 sequestration could be\nachieved during the production of different algal biomass in numerous type of wastewater effluent. The regression of different system models and interpretation of linear coefficients were represented in this statistically\napproached studies. Apart from that the paper also discuss the uncertainty of linear regressions using Monte\nCarlo method, influence of physical parameters on biomass production, energy potential and efficiency of nutrient removal using different phototrophic systems.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Indu Ambat [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Walter Z.
