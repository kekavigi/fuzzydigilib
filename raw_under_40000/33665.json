{"Nomor": 33665, "Judul": "WAVEFORM OF GRAVITY AND CAPILLARY-GRAVITY WAVES OVER A BATHYMETRY", "Abstrak": "We examine the waveforms of linear waves over a fully submerged, arbitrarily periodic bed, using the recent Floquet theory for gravity waves and extending it to the regime of capillary-gravity waves. The exact solutions illustrate the complex features of waveform geometry that are frequency dependent, including the modulation of propagating waveforms in space-time, spatially modulated standing waveforms, asymmetric waveforms over a symmetric bed profile, and high-curvature wave-crest forms. These features are in contrast to the trivial and invariant sinusoidal waveform of the ordinary linear waves on a flat bed, but reminiscent of nonlinear waveforms. The effect of surface tension is seen to counteract wave scattering by topography, tending to restore the waveform towards a symmetric and sinusoidal geometry. These features are the general characteristics of linear waves over a periodic bed since they are the properties of eigenmodes, and can inspire andguide applications.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "JIE YU [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS 4, 014806 (2019); Published by the American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Jan 2019"}
