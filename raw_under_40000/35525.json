{"Nomor": 35525, "Judul": "SEVERE CONSTRAINTS ON NEW PHYSICS EXPLANATIONS OF THE MINIBOONE EXCESS", "Abstrak": "The MiniBooNE experiment has recently reported an anomalous 4.5? excess of electronlike events\nconsistent with ?e appearance from a ?? beam at short baseline. Given the lack of corresponding ??\ndisappearance observations, required in the case of oscillations involving a sterile flavor, there is strong\nmotivation for alternative explanations of this anomaly. We consider the possibility that the observed\nelectronlike signal may actually be initiated by particles produced in the MiniBooNE target, without\ninvolving new sources of neutrino production or any neutrino oscillations. We find that the electronlike\nevent energy and angular distributions in the full MiniBooNE dataset, including neutrino, antineutrino, and\nbeam dump modes, severely limit and, in some cases, rule out new physics scenarios as an explanation for the observed neutrino and antineutrino mode excesses. Specifically, scenarios in which the particle\nproduced in the target either decays (visibly or semivisibly) or scatters elastically in the detector are\nstrongly disfavored. Using generic kinematic arguments, we extend the existing MiniBooNE results and\ninterpretations to exhaustively constrain previously unconsidered new physics signatures and emphasize\nthe power of the MiniBooNE beam dump search to further limit models for the excess.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "JOHNATHON R.
