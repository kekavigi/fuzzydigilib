{"Nomor": 36210, "Judul": "Vector-based excitation amplitude imaging condition for elastic RTM", "Abstrak": "In recent years, many studies have focused on elastic reverse time migration (RTM). In response to the problems\nassociated with elastic RTM, we propose a new procedure for 2D elastic multicomponent RTM. In this new method,\ndecomposed P- and S-wave components are obtained from the decoupled propagation of the source and receiver\nwavefields, which allows the expedient calculation of the Poynting vectors and the incident and reflection angles\nof the P- and S-waves. In addition, we deduce the vector-based excitation amplitude imaging condition. This process automatically accounts for the particle vibration directions when determining the angle-dependent signed reflection coefficients, and does not require the sign to be determined apart from the value of the reflection\ncoefficients. This concept was further extended to the source-normalized crosscorrelation imaging condition.\nThe reflection coefficient of the layered model test was in agreement with the Zoeppritz theory, the PP and PS\nwave images of the Marmousi II model were clear, and the PS wave images had higher resolution and richer details.\nIn addition, since the calculated reflection coefficients are angle-dependent, they can be easily used for the extraction of angle-domain common-image gathers. Moreover, the imaging condition avoids the polarization reversal in\nPS wave images and does not require all of the source wavefield data. Consequently, the computation and storage\nrequirements are significantly reduced, which will facilitate the use of the elastic RTM in practice", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jinju Zhou [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Deli Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Elastic reverse time migration Vector-based Angle-dependent Imaging condition", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 147 (2017) 1\u20139, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.10.003", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Mar 2019"}
