{"Nomor": 37817, "Judul": "EFFECT OFMAGNETICNANOPARTICLES ONTHE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF TYPE-II SUPERCONDUCTORS", "Abstrak": "In this paper, the effect of magnetic nanoparticles on the mechanical properties of\na type-II superconductor is investigated both theoretically and numerically. Magnetic part of the\npinning force associated with the interaction between a finite-size spheroidal magnetic inclusion\nand an Abrikosov vortex is calculated in the London approximation. It is found that the size\nand shape of magnetic nanoparticles result in different enhancements of vortex pinning in large-?\ntype-II superconductors. Meanwhile, the screening current induced by a magnetic spheroid suffer\nthe action of Lorentz force, which will lead to prestress in the superconductor, so further numerical\ncalculations are needed to explore the interaction between the spheroidal magnetic particle and\nsuperconductor. The distribution of displacement, stress and strain in the superconductor are\nfinally obtained. It is shown that different sizes and shapes of nanoparticles also can change the\ndistributions of these quantities.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Chenguang Huang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Huadong Yong, Youhe Zhou"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "magnetic nanoparticles, spheroidal inclusion, pinning force, stress distribution, type-II superconductor", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Apr 2019"}
