{"Nomor": 37982, "Judul": "The Effect Of Physical Property Change On The Water Flooding Development In Changqing Oilfield Jurassic Low Permeability Reservoir", "Abstrak": "Changqing old oilfield Jurassic reservoir's average calibration recovery is 24.7%, with geological\nreserves recovery of 16.6%, water cut of 65.2%. And most of Jurassic reservoirs are in the middle and\nlater field life, part of them has entered the high water cut and high recovery stage. Traditional\nwater flooding way for improving oil recovery becomes more difficult, and new method has to be\nconsidered. Maling oilfield BS district is a typical representative, with high water cut of 90.8%, high\nrecovery percent of 26.1% and low oil recovery rate of 0.25%. To explore the new way to improve oil\nrecovery, the polymer and surfactant (SP for short) important pilot test has been developed. The\nlow permeability reservoir indoor core data in high water cut stage and inspection well results\nindicate that the reservoir permeability, pore combination characteristics and pore type changed\ngreatly after long-term water flooding development. These changes bring more difficulties to the\ncontinue development, especially the high injection pressure, which can cause other problems for\nwell pattern infilling and EOR. This paper takes the high injection pressure problem of Maling BS\ndistrict Jurassic reservoir for example, analyzes the physical property change law on the following\naspects: the development mode in the past, core analysis, formation sensitivity, interstitial matter,\nwell test interpretation results, in order to help to further effective development and provide\nimportant parameters for tertiary oil recovery technique for similar reservoirs and others.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "YANGNAN SHANGGUAN [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yongqiang Zhang", "Weiliang Xiong"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Jurassic reservoir, Physical property change ,Water flooding, Core analysis, EOR, Low permeability", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 4, Pages 300-306 (December  2015),", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Mei 2019"}
