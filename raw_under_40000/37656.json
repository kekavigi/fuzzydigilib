{"Nomor": 37656, "Judul": "Throughput efficiency and queueing analysis of generalised stop-and-wait ARQ protocols", "Abstrak": "This paper deals with the throughput\nefficiency and queueing analysis of efficient stopand-\nwait ARQ protocols suitable to control errors\nin data communication systems. Some novel stopand-\nwait ARQ schemes are also proposed. These\nstop-and wait ARQ schemes involve simple modifications\nof the classical scheme to provide an\nhigher system reliability. The performance of the\nstop-and-wait techniques studied in the paper are\nanalytically derived to compare their effectiveness\nin control errors in data communication systems\nwith previous proposed efficient stop-and-wait\nARQ schemes, in particular under high error rate\nconditions.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "R.
