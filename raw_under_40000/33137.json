{"Nomor": 33137, "Judul": "Optimization of the horizontal-well multiple hydraulic fracturing operation in a low-permeability carbonate reservoir using fully coupled XFEM model", "Abstrak": "Pre-analysis of the geometry and deviation of multiple hydraulically induced fractures is a decisive factor in the\nsuccessful multiple hydraulic fracturing operations. Besides, fracture spacing should be optimal for obtaining\ndesired results such as maintaining sufficient aperture for proppant placement, avoiding screen-outs and also\npreventing fracture closure or crossing multiple fractures. In fact, the final geometry and deviation of multiple\nhydraulic fractures are dramatically influenced by the interaction of multiple hydraulic fractures on each other\nknown as stress shadow effect which is caused by fracture spacing and pore pressure change. Predicting the\ngeometry and deviation of multiple hydraulic fractures is a challenging part of conducting this technology in\nIlam reservoir due to low matrix permeability and naturally fractured nature of the reservoir. Accordingly, a\nfully coupled stress-diffusion XFEM model for initiation and propagation of multiple hydraulic fractures with\nfive injection zones was prepared to optimize the effect of fracture spacing and pore pressure change on the\nmultiple hydraulic fractures\u2019 deviation and geometry. Additionally, the XFEM model was verified by three approaches including field data, Stress Intensity Factor and KGD zero toughness solution wherein a very good\nagreement with negligible error was obtained for SIF, field data and KGD M-vertex solution. However, this study\nhas confirmed that both pore pressure and stress shadows contribute to change the fracture geometry and its\ndeviation significantly in Ilam reservoir. Also, increasing pore pressure between fractures, may affect the fracture\ngeometry to be tighter in width and shorter in length. In addition, considering optimized fracture spacing about\n75 m resulted in creation of very smooth, uniform and deeper multiple hydraulic fractures; so, there will be no\nclosed fractures in DPH-02 horizontal wellbore and the possibility of crossing the furthest fracture by the second\nfracture significantly reduced when the fracture spacing was higher than 5 m.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Seyed Erfan Saberhosseini [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Kaveh Ahangari and Hossein Mohammadrezaei"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Applied physics", "Kata Kunci": "Multiple hydraulic fracture, Fracture spacing, Hydraulic fracture geometry, Hydraulic fracture deviation, Fully coupled XFEM model", "Sumber": "International Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences 114 (2019) 33\u201345", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Jan 2019"}
