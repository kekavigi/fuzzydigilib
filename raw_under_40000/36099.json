{"Nomor": 36099, "Judul": "One-Dimensional Assemblies of a DNA Tetrahedron: Manipulationson the Structural Conformation and Single-Molecule Behaviors", "Abstrak": "DNA nanotechnology can construct variousnanostructures with diverse functionalities. However, con-formationfluctuations due to the structuralflexibility ofduplex DNA compromise the efficiency to realize thefunctionality and reactivity of DNA nanostructures. Tounderstand and control the structural deviation from thedesign represents a major challenge as well as an opportunityfor DNA nanotechnology. In the present work, two series ofone-dimensional assemblies of DNA tetrahedrons (DTHs)were fabricated and applied to demonstrate the manipulationsof conformation dynamicsof a one-dimensional DTHassembly by simple variation on linkage styles at single-molecule resolution. A stepwise strategy allows both nanoassembly with a highfidelity in the number and sequence of DTHunits to be assembled with a minimum number of linkage sequences. The characterization for these nanostructures with atomicforce microscope (AFM) and a solid-state nanopore technique indicates the difference in conformation dynamics and bendingstiffness between two analogous nanoassemblies both in the immobilized state on the surface and free state in solution. Thiswork showed the power offine-tuning the dynamic conformation of the nanostructures and could see the applications in single-molecule biosensing and functionalization of DNA nanostructures.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Liying_Wang_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/161602"}, "Penulis": "Liying Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zhentong Zhu,Bingling Li,Fangwei Shao"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "one dimension, DNA tetrahedron, conformation dynamics, single-molecule analysis, solid-state nanopore", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
