{"Nomor": 37368, "Judul": "Contributions of mTOR Activation-Mediated Upregulation of Synapsin II and Neurite Outgrowth to Hyperalgesia in STZ-Induced Diabetic Rats", "Abstrak": "Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) is among the common\ncomplications in diabetes mellitus (DM), with its underlying mechanisms\nlargely unknown. Synapsin II is primarily expressed in the spinal dorsal horn,\nand its upregulation mediates a superfluous release of glutamate and a\ndeficiency of GABAergic interneuron synaptic transmission, which is directly\nimplicated in the facilitation of pain signals in the hyperalgesic nociceptive\nresponse. Recently, synapsin II has been revealed to be associated with the\nmodulation of neurite outgrowth, whereas the process of this neuronal\nstructural neuroplasticity following neuronal hyperexcitability still remains\nunclear. In this study, we found that under conditions of elevated glucose,\nTNF-? induced the activation of mTOR, mediating the upregulation of\nsynapsin II and neurite outgrowth in dorsal horn neurons....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Wan-you He [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Bin Zhang, Wei-cheng Zhao, Jian He, Lei Zhang, Qing-ming Xiong, Jing Wang, and Han-bing Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Diabetes complications, hyperalgesia, synapsin II, neurite outgrowth, mTOR", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Mar 2019"}
