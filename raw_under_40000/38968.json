{"Nomor": 38968, "Judul": "Structure and Dynamics of a Graphene Melt", "Abstrak": "We explore the structural and dynamic properties\nof bulk materials composed of graphene nanosheets using\ncoarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. Remarkably, our\nresults show clear evidence that bulk graphene materials exhibit\na fluid-like behavior similar to linear polymer melts at elevated\ntemperatures and that these materials transform into a glassy-like\n\u201cfoam\u201d state at temperatures below the glass-transition temperature (Tg) of these materials. Distinct from an isolated graphene\nsheet, which exhibits a relatively flat shape with fluctuations, we\nfind that graphene sheets in a melt state structurally adopt more\n\u201ccrumpled\u201d configurations and correspondingly smaller sizes, as\nnormally found for ordinary polymers in the melt. Upon\napproaching the glass transition, these two-dimensional polymeric materials exhibit a dramatic slowing down of their dynamics that is likewise similar to ordinary linear polymer glassforming liquids. Bulk graphene materials in their glassy foam state have an exceptionally large free-volume and high\nthermal stability due to their high Tg (? 1600 K) as compared to conventional polymer materials. Our findings show that\ngraphene melts have interesting lubricating and \u201cplastic\u201d flow properties at elevated temperatures, and suggest that\ngraphene foams are highly promising as high surface filtration materials and fire suppression additives for improving the\nthermal conductivities and mechanical reinforcement of polymer materials.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Wenjie Xia 1.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170713"}, "Penulis": "Wenjie Xia [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Fernando Vargas-Lara, Sinan Keten, Jack F.
