{"Nomor": 34164, "Judul": "Novel Cyanostilbene-Based Fluorescent Chemoprobe for Hydroxyl Radicals and Its Two-Photon Bioimaging in Living Cells", "Abstrak": "A novel cyanostilbene derivative as a selective fluorescent chemoprobe for hydroxyl radicals was synthesized. The chemoprobe shows strong green emission in aqueous solution with the addition of hydroxyl radicals. Conversely, negligible emission changes are observed upon addition of other reactive oxygen species. The chemoprobe 1 shows high sensitivity, having the low detection limit of ?1.0 \u00d7 10?7 M. Furthermore, the fluorescent chemoprobe exhibits low cytotoxicity and is effectively applied to bioimaging of hydroxyl radicals by two-photon confocal microscopy in HeLa cells. These results indicate that the new chemoprobe has great potential for bioimaging in vivo and in vitro systems.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Na Young Lim [- ]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Junho Ahn, Miae Won, Wonjin Choi, Jong Seung Kim, and Jong Hwa Jung."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "hydroxyl radical, fluorescent chemoprobe, cyanostilbene, reactive oxygen species, living cell.", "Sumber": "DOI: 10.1021/acsabm.8b00796 ACS Appl.
