{"Nomor": 33286, "Judul": "Effect Of Wettability Of Ceramic Proppant Surface In Guar Gum Solution On The Oil Flow Efficiency In Fractures", "Abstrak": "Guar gum and its derivatives have been the most commonly used polymers to increase the viscosity of\nfracture fluids. Ceramic proppants are vital products for enhancing oil and gas well productivity in\nlow-permeability reservoirs. In the last several decades, abundant studies have been found in the\ninvestigation of proppant size, shape, compositions on the fracture conductivity. However, few types of\nresearch can be found to study the proppant wettability effect on the oil and gas flow efficiency. In our\nresearch, eight experiments were conducted using traditional guar gum fracturing fluid. Results of this\nwork indicated that ceramic proppant promotes oil flow efficiency from sandstone core samples to\nproppant packs and thus should promote oil well productivity. The mechanism behind this phenomenon\nis believed to be the formation of oil flow channels across the fracture face due to the imbibition of oil\nin the core onto the oil-wet surface of the proppant, promoting oil flow from the core to the fracture.\nAfter guar gum was added the results inverted, this phenomenon for water-wet proppant is believed to\nbe increased by the viscosity of fracture fluids which increased the viscosity of water, promoting oil\nflow from the core to the fracture. Nevertheless, the stimulation effect of oil-wet proppant on oil flow\nefficiency can be reduced by the presence of guar gum solution. Inside the proppant matrix filled with\nguar gum fracturing fluid, oil can be blocked inside the proppant matrix as a discontinuous phase while\nthe aqueous phase can be easily mixed with the guar gum fluid and then be transferred out.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "KANJICAI DONG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ming Wang, Chi Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Ceramic Proppant Surface, oil and gas ,  Fractures", "Sumber": "Petroleum, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.12.009", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Jan 2019"}
