{"Nomor": 33576, "Judul": "LANDAU-POMERANCHUK-MIDGAL EFFECT AND CHARM PRODUCTION IN PP COLLISIONS AT ENERGIES AVAILABLE AT THE CERN LARGE HADRON COLLIDER USING THE PARTON CASCADE MODEL", "Abstrak": "We study the impact of the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Midgal (LPM) effect on the dynamics of parton interactions in proton-proton collisions at energies available at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. For our investigation we utilize a microscopic kinetic theory based on the Boltzmann equation. The calculation traces the space-time evolution of the cascading partons interacting via semihard pQCD scatterings and fragmentations. We focus on the impact of the LPM effect on the production of charm quarks, since their production is exclusively governed by processes well described in our kinetic theory. The LPM effect is found to become more prominent as the collision energy rises and at central rapidities, and may significantly affect the model\u2019s predicted charm distributions at low momenta.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "DINESH K.
