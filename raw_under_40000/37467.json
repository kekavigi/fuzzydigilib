{"Nomor": 37467, "Judul": "Zeeman-Induced Valley-Sensitive Photocurrent in MonolayerMoS2", "Abstrak": "The control of the valley degree of freedom lies at the core of interest in monolayer transition metaldichalcogenides, where specific valley-spin excitation can be created using circularly polarized light.Measurement and manipulation of the valley index has also been achieved, but mainly with purely opticalmethods. Here, in monolayer MoS2, we identify a response to the valley polarization of excitons in thelongitudinal electrical transport when the valley degeneracy is broken by an out-of-plane magnetic fieldBz.The spin information is also simultaneously determined with spin-sensitive contacts. In the presence ofBz,a significant modulation of the photocurrent is observed as a function of the circular polarization state of theexcitation. We attribute this effect to unbalanced transport of valley-polarized trions induced by theopposite Zeeman shifts of two (KandK0) valleys. Our interpretation is supported by the contrastingbehavior in bilayer MoS2, as well as the observed doping and spatial dependence of the valley photocurrent.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xiao-Xiao Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["You Lai,", "Emma Dohner'", "Seongphill Moon,", "Takashi Taniguchi,", "Kenji Watanabe,", "Dmitry Smirnov.", "and Tony F.
