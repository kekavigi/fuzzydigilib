{"Nomor": 37109, "Judul": "Single Additive with Dual Functional-Ions for Stabilizing LithiumAnodes", "Abstrak": "The dendritic lithium formation and sustained lithiumconsumption caused by the uncontrollable side reactions betweenlithium and electrolytes seriously restrict the applications of lithiumanodes in high-energy density batteries, especially in carbonateelectrolytes. Ameliorating the surface status of lithium anodes is criticalfor modulating lithium deposition behavior and improving the cyclingstability of lithium metal batteries. Herein, magnesium chloride salt isfirst reported as a carbonate electrolyte additive for lithium surfacemodification by in situ reaction. It is proved that both Cl?and Mg2+playimportant roles in building a stable electrode/electrolyte interface with afast Li+diffusion property. The coexistence of inorganic LiCl andmetallic Mg species in the interface can effectively decrease the surfaceside reactions, lower interphase resistance, promote Li ions diffusion,and result in uniform lithium deposition. The electrochemical tests show that the reversible utilization rate of lithium for Li/Cuasymmetrical cells increases by 10% and the polarization of Li/Li symmetrical cells is reduced noteworthily with such anadditive. Furthermore, a significant improved cycling performance of Li/Li4T5O12full cells is also achieved", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Yan_Ouyang_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/163641"}, "Penulis": "Yan Ouyang, [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yanpeng Guo,Dian Li,Yaqing Wei,Tianyou Zhai,Huiqiao Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "electrolyte additive, magnesium halide salts, lithium anode stability, lithium metal battery", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
