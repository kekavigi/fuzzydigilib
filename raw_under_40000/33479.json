Almost all subsurfacemodelingworkflows use\nthese maps: for example, pore pressure models and reservoir geomechanics. These studies generally involve\nsumsof properties along the vertical, consequently, noise or acquisition artifacts at the seafloormap tend to propagate\nand even amplify in the subsequent models. Seafloor maps are normally acquired by sound-sensing technology\nand related procedures, which expectedly introduce noise and artifacts. Moving window filters, such as\naverage and median filters, are easy to use and fast to compute, hence they are used very often by interpreters\nto make geologically sound horizons. However such filters are unable to discern noise, artifacts and signal,\nresulting in the compromise of actual information. Filtering in the frequency domain can pose difficulties\nwhen noise, artifacts and geological information overlap in the frequency domain, as the total energy tend to concentrate\nin the lowest frequencies. Factorial kriging (FK) is a spatial filter that yields separate estimations, each\ncorresponding to a variogram nested structure. FK relies on the principle that structurally complex information\nis a sumof independent information componentswhile the variogramis a clear and reliableway to select the frequency\nranges of each component. Hence, this method can effectively separate acquisition artifacts from seafloor\ninformation based on their different spatial structuresmodeledwith variograms. Thiswork investigates an application\nof FK for filtering of hard-edged (broadband) artifacts in post-processed interpreted seismic data. Differently\nfrom random noise, artifacts are spatially correlated information components mixed with actual geologic\ninformation. Initially, removal of the bathymetric trend makes the case stationary for a high-resolution variogram\nmap computed in the frequency domain via fast Fourier transform (FFT), which enables a full 2D variogram\nmodeling. Theoretical variogram surfaces are fit to the experimental variogram map, enabling the identification\nand modeling of a set of nested variograms. The authors envisaged search strategies to select a small number of\ninformative samples to reduce kriging runtime and, at the same time, cover the necessary spatially correlated\nvariability. Aworkflowon a large seismic-derived seafloor 2Dmap is demonstrated, detailing each stepwith emphasis\non the sensitive variogram modeling step, followed by search strategy definition and choice of the\ngeology-bearing factors for seafloor restoration. Filtering in frequency domain was performed for comparison.\nResults showed that broadband artifacts require a non-traditional approach to variogram modeling, which was\nperformed in a second FK runwith awholly newvariogrammodel. The filtering operations revealed seafloor features,\nwhich were previously unseen in the original map, and the final result was similar to that obtained with\nFFT. FK is a lossless filtering technique that is a highly effective method to remove acquisition footprints in\nfinal grids and volumes in which acquisition geometry information is not available.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Paulo Roberto Moura de Carvalho  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Luiz Gustavo Rasera, Jo\u00e3o Felipe Coimbra Leite Costa, Marcelus Glaucus Souza Ara\u00fajo, Luiz Eduardo Seabra Varella"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Information decomposition Artifact removal Fast Fourier transform Geophysics Variogram Geostatistics", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 161 (2019) 92\u2013104, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.12.009", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Jan 2019"}
