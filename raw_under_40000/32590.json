{"Nomor": 32590, "Judul": "Service Life Prediction of Shaft Sidewall Exposed to Sulfate Environment", "Abstrak": "Under the influence of underground water with high concentration of sulfate, several vertical shafts in the Huang-Huai region are\nseriously corroded but have varying degradation degrees in different parts. Taking the auxiliary shaft of Lin-Huan coal mine as the\nresearch subject, the mechanism of this phenomenon was studied. /en, wet-dry alternated and immersion corrosion tests were\ncarried out, and it was found that only the dry-wet alternated accelerate test is representative of the corrosion mechanism that\ncause the corrosion in the shaft. However, it will cost much time and money for the laboratory test to reach the same degradation\ndepth. To solve this problem, combining with field and laboratory tests, a modified theoretical degradation model was developed\nto evaluate the residual life of the corroded sidewall. /e results indicate that the residual life of the shaft sidewall is 25 years, and\nthe damaged parts have no need for an immediate reinforcement.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "WEI HE  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xia Meng", "Ji-hui Zhao"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Sulfates & the environment", "Sumber": "Advances in Materials Science and Engineering Volume 2018, Article ID 3038685, 12 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/3038685", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Des 2018"}
