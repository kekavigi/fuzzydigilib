{"Nomor": 37523, "Judul": "Optimizing the Fluorescence Properties of Nanoemulsions for SingleParticle Tracking in Live Cells", "Abstrak": "Nanoemulsions (NEs) are biocompatible lipid nano-particles composed of an oily core stabilized by a surfactant shell. Itis acknowledged that the surface decoration with poly(ethyleneglycol), through the use of nonionic surfactants, confers high stealthin biological medium with reduced nonspecific interactions.Tracking individual NE byfluorescence microscopy techniqueswould lead to a better understanding of their behavior in cells andthus require the development of bright single particles withenhanced photostability. However, the understanding of therelationship between the physicochemical properties and chemicalcomposition of the NEs, on the one hand, and itsfluorescenceproperties of encapsulated dyes, on the other hand, remains limited. Herein, we synthesized three new dioxaborine barbiturylstyryl (DBS) dyes that displayed high molar extinction coefficients (up to 120 000 M?1cm?1) with relatively low quantumyields in solvents and impressivefluorescence enhancement when dissolved in viscous oils (up to 0.98). The reported screeningof nine different oils allowed disclosing a range of efficient\u201coil/dye\u201dcouples and understanding the main parameters that lead tothe brightest NEs. We determine vitamin E acetate/DBS-C8as the representative most efficient couple, combining high dyeloading capabilities and low aggregation-induced quenching, leading to <50 nm ultrabright NEs (with brightness as high as 30\u00d7106M?1cm?1) with negligible dye leakage in biological media. Beyond a comprehensive optical and physicochemicalcharacterization offluorescent NEs, cellular two-photon excitation imaging was performed with polymer-coated cell penetratingNEs. Thanks to their impressive brightness and photostability, NEs displaying different charge surfaces were microinjected inHeLa cells and were individually tracked in the cytosol to study their relative velocity.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Xinyue_Wang_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164884"}, "Penulis": "Xinyue Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Nicolas Anton,Pichandi Ashokkumar,Halina Anton,Tkhe Kyong Fam,Thierry Vandamme,Andrey S.
