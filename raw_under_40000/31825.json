In this study, hydrazone-type \n\nSchiff base compounds, salicylaldehyde-2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone (SDPH), \n\nresulted from condensation of salicylaldehyde (1.5 mmol) and 2,4- \n\ndinitrophenylhydrazine (1.5 mmol) has been synthesized. The structure of SDPH \n\nhas been characterized by 1H-NMR. The synthesized SDPH are used as ligands in \n\nformation of its Cu(II) and Co(II) metal complexes. The Cu(II)-SDPH and Co(II)- \n\nSDPH complexes were synthesized from metal ion and ligand with reflux reaction \n\nat 60 oC for 6 hours in molar ratio 1:2 and 1:3, respectively. Triethylamine is used \n\nto synthesis Co(II)-SDPH, which serves to deprotonate SDPH ligands. Dimeric and \n\nneutral charge of complexes are obtained by ESI-MS analysis. The resulting Cu(II)- \n\nSDPH and Co(II)-SDPH complexes have the chemical formula \n\n[Cu2(SDPH)2(H2O)4(OH)2] ([M+Na]+ = 858 g/ mol) and \n\n[Co2(SDPH)2[(Et)3N]2(acn)2(OH)2} ([M+Na]+ = 1061 g/ mol), shown on the ESIMS \n\nspectrum. Coordinate bonds between Cu (II) or Co (II) metal ions with ligands \n\nare observed in the presence of shifting of the C= N wave number, as well as the \n\nloss of the vibrating peaks of the O-H groups to the infrared spectra of each \n\ncomplexes. The IR spectrum of complexes was suggested that SDPH behave as a \n\nbidentate ligand through the azomethine nitrogen atom and phenolic oxygen atom. \n\nThe Cu(II) and Co(II) complexes were paramagnetic in nature. The ligand and its \n\nCu(II) and Co(II) complexes have been screened for antioxidant activity against \n\nDPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazine). Based on the results of the activity test, \n\nIC50 values of Cu(II)-SDPH and Co(II)-SPDH complexes were lower than those of \n\nthe SDPH ligands. These results show that the two complexes of SDPH are \n\npotentials as antioxidants.", "Daftar File": {"2018 TS PP YULYANI NUR AZIZAH 20515041 1 ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/142434", "2018_TS_PP_YULYANI_NUR_AZIZAH_1-_COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/149081", "2018_TS_PP_YULYANI_NUR_AZIZAH_1-_BAB1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/149082", "2018_TS_PP_YULYANI_NUR_AZIZAH_1-_BAB2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/149083", "2018_TS_PP_YULYANI_NUR_AZIZAH_1-_BAB3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/149084", "2018_TS_PP_YULYANI_NUR_AZIZAH_1-_BAB4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/149085", "2018_TS_PP_YULYANI_NUR_AZIZAH_1-_BAB5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/149086", "2018_TS_PP_YULYANI_NUR_AZIZAH_1-_PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/149087"}, "Penulis": "YULYANI NUR AZIZAH NIM: 20515041", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing 1 : Dr. Irma Mulyani,M.Si \n\nPembimbing 1 : Dr. Deana Wahyuningrum,M.Si"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Schiff base, hydrazone, Salicylaldehyde-2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone (SDPH), Cu(II) complexes, Co(II) complexes, antioxidant activity, DPPH", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor \u00a0\n                                     Latifa Noor", "File": "8 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Jun 2018"}
