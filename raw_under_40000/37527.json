{"Nomor": 37527, "Judul": "Philosophical interpretat ion of the visuality regime: convergence of  culture practices, conventions, and experience.", "Abstrak": "This work is devoted to the importance of the visual turn in the modern society, and to the fact, that the visual turn has drawn attention  to  the  variety  of  existing  scopic  regimes  and  to  the  system  of  factors  changing  them.  It  deals  with  the  nature  of  a  contemporary dominant scopic regime in our society and gives the definition of scopic regime or, as it is also called, the regime of seeing. In order to get a broad picture on this issue, we are going to create the typology for analyses of scopic regime, where three  main  groups  of  approaches  can  be  distinguished:  phenomenological,  psychoanalytical,  post-structuralist and  synthetic.\nThe second part of the research will be focused primarily on the vision practice of the twenties of XX century. The implicit aim of the work is to create some kind of typology of scopic regimes, existing in the Soviet and the post-Soviet space, and to define the origins of these regimes. The highlight of the research is to reconstruct the local context of the visual experience description and  the  scopic  regime  at  the  modern  age. In  order  to  identify  the  basis  for  any  scopic  regime,  the  work  makes  several  conceptual assumptions underlying the basic conclusions on this issue.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Nataliya Kolodii [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Vyacheslav Kolodii, Yuliya  Chay ka Nataliya Goncharova"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "regime of visuality, scopic regime, cultural practices, the visual turn, visual matrix, imaginary, symbolic .", "Sumber": "Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 166 ( 2015 ) 552 \u2013 556", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Apr 2019"}
