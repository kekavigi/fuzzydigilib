{"Nomor": 37608, "Judul": "Resonator based logarithmic filter banks", "Abstrak": "The paper provides a technique to\ndesign and approximate computationally efficient\ndigital filter banks whose centre frequencies are\nspaced logarithmically. The design procedure consists\nof two steps: The design of 'mother' filter\nbanks and the frequency windowing processing\nfor the final filter banks. The resonator with the\npurely imaginary transfer function on the unit\ncircle is treated as the basic element of the mother\nbank and the frequency interpolating filter bank\nstructure is applied. Different pole-zero structures\nare studied and an infinite filter bank is explored\nfrom the theoretical point of view. The outputs of\nthe mother filter banks are weighted and summed\nto produce the final banks with significantly\nimproved responses. Linear programming is\napplied to find the optimal weighting coefficients,\nand the experiments for a variety of windows are\nmade with a discussion of the results and some\ntradeoffs for window selection. The results show\nthat these filter banks have good frequency\nresponse and allow control of crossover gain, and\nthey are useful for voice and music analysis and\ntone receivers.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Genzao Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["W.F.
