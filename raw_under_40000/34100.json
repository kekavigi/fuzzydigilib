{"Nomor": 34100, "Judul": "Cell concentrations and metabolites enhance the SIP response to biofilm matrix components", "Abstrak": "We investigated the relative effect of different bacterial biofilm components to influence spectral induced polarization\n(SIP) signals and Cole-Cole model parameters (i.e. normalized chargeability (S m?1) and relaxation time\n(?)) in order to reduce the ambiguity associated with interpretation of SIP signatures in biostimulated environments.\nSIP measurements were collected over a frequency range, (i.e. 0.1 Hz\u20131 kHz) from experimental columns\ncontaining Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 (non-mucoid bacterial strain) cell suspensions alone and cell suspensionsmixed\nwith differentmolecules associated with P. aeruginosa biofilmmatrix (alginate, DNA and phenazine).\nResults from SIPmeasurements of cell density investigations suggest an increase in phase (~ 200%), imaginary conductivity\n(?? S m?1), and normalized chargeability (S m?1) values as cell densities increase (1.50\u20135.55 \u00d7 109\nCFUml?1), yet no significant change in the real conductivity (?? Sm?1) or relaxation time was observed. The addition\nof alginate resulted in a suppression of phase (?mrads), imaginary conductivity (??Sm?1), and normalized\nchargeability (Sm?1) response. However, amixture of cells and alginate increased all parameters butwith no significant\nchanges in real conductivity (?? S m?1) or relaxation time. Similar trend was observed in the DNA treatments;\nincreasing concentrations of DNA reduced the imaginary conductivity (?? S m?1), phase (? mrads), and\nnormalized chargeability (S m?1) response. In contrast, the addition of phenazine, a secondary metabolite of\nP. aeruginosa, resulted in a significant increase in both imaginary conductivity (?? S m?1), phase (? mrads), and\nnormalized chargeability (S m?1) values especially at larger concentrations (N50 mM). Our work suggests that\ncell density and metabolites are significant factors increasing the polarization response in biofilms and advances\nthe interpretation of electrical signals associated with biofilms in the subsurface.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Carl L.
