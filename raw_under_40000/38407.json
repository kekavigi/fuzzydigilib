{"Nomor": 38407, "Judul": "Developing a culturally-specific mixed methods approach to global research", "Abstrak": "With much of the development of mixed methods occurring through the works of scholars from the US, the UK, Canada, and the Anglos-Saxon/Englishspeaking countries, the discourse about a global research community must consider how it needs to be sensitive to diverse cultures. Clearly, the discussion must focus on adapting mixed methods to best fit the problems of countries, the cultural norms of conducting research, and the scholarly talents of in-country investigators. Unfortunately, the mixed methods literature is largely silent on diverse cultural adaptations of mixed methods. In this article, we first trace the involvement of worldwide countries in the historic development of mixed methods. Then, to gain a better understanding of the use and adaptation of mixed methods in diverse world academic cultures, we provide\na qualitative study of themes mentioned by participants from seven different countries. From both the historical overview and the qualitative study, we end by making suggestions about specific strategies for a global discourse about mixed methods research, and suggest a de-colonizing presence of the Anglo-Saxon/English-speaking countries in the global expansion of mixed methods.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "John W.
