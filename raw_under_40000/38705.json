Currently, the application of additive manufacturing\nis limited by the availability of functional inks, especially in the\narea of biomaterials; this is the first time when this method is\nused to tackle this problem, allowing hundreds of formulations\nto be readily assessed. Several functional properties, including\nthe release of an antidepressive drug (paroxetine), cytotoxicity, and printability, are screened for 253 new ink formulations in a\nhigh-throughput format as well as mechanical properties. The selected candidates with the desirable properties are successfully\nscaled up using 3D printing into a range of object architectures. A full drug release study and degradability and tensile modulus\nexperiments are presented on a simple architecture to validating the suitability of this methodology to identify printable inks for\n3D printing devices with bespoke properties.", "Daftar File": {"2019 JRNL PP Iria Louzouu 1.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170183"}, "Penulis": "Iria Louzao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Britta Koch, Vincenzo Taresco, Laura Ruiz-Cantu, Derek J.
