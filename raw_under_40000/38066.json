{"Nomor": 38066, "Judul": "Critical opalescence across the doping-driven Mott transition in optical lattices of ultracold atoms", "Abstrak": "Phase transitions and their associated crossovers are imprinted in the behavior of fluctuations. Motivated by recent experiments on ultracold atoms in optical lattices, we compute the thermodynamic density fluctuations ?N2 of the two-dimensional fermionic Hubbard model with plaquette cellular dynamical mean-field theory. To understand the length scale of these fluctuations, we separate the local from the nonlocal contributions to ?N2. We determine the effects of particle statistics, interaction strength U, temperature T, and density n. At high temperature, our theoretical framework reproduces the experimental observations in the doping-driven crossover regime between metal and Mott insulator. At low temperature, there is an increase of thermodynamic density fluctuations, analogous to critical opalescence, accompanied by a surprising reduction of the absolute value of  their nonlocal contributions. This is a precursory sign of an underlying phase transition between a pseudogap phase and a metallic phase in doped Mott insulators, which should play an important role in the cuprate hightemperature superconductors. Predictions for ultracold atom experiments are made.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "C. Walsh [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["P. Semon,", "G. Sordi,", "and A.-M. S.
