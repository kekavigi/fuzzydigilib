A series of well-controlled experiments was performed, in which\nthe hydraulic fracture propagation behaviors in two-dimensionally confined gelatin plates were monitored while\nvarying the gelatin stiffness, fracturing fluid viscosity, and injection flow rate. In all cases, comet-shaped, bi-wing\nfractures were initiated, and the fluid pressure responses and fracture geometry, including propagation velocity,\nlength, width, and opening area were analyzed using the acquired time-lapsed images. The fracture propagation\ninitiated before the peak pressure value, and the initiation pressure increased with the gelatin stiffness, injection\nflow rate, and viscosity, however, mainly governed by the elastic stiffness. Contrary to theoretical models, two\nstates were identified over the course of comet-shaped hydraulic fracture propagation: a transient state in which\nthe fracture propagation velocity and fracture width gradually increased, and thereafter, a steady state where the\nvelocity and width became consistent. As a result, the steady-state propagation velocity was primarily determined by the flow rate, and the fracture width in a steady state was proportional to the fluid pressure normalized by the medium stiffness, owing to the elastic response. Based on experimental observations, simple but\nrobust semi-empirical models were suggested to predict the fracture width and propagation velocity in a steady\nstate.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Soo-Min Ham [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Tae-Hyuk Kwon"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Hydraulic fracture, Fracture geometry, Steady state propagation, Fracture visualization", "Sumber": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrmms.2018.12.023", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Mar 2019"}
