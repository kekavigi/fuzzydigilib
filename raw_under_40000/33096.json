{"Nomor": 33096, "Judul": "Significance of interactions between microplastics and POPs in the marine environment: A critical overview", "Abstrak": "The presence of plastic debris in the ocean is increasing and several effects in the marine environment\nhave been reported. A great number of studies have demonstrated that microplastics (MPs) adsorb\norganic compounds concentrating them several orders of magnitude than the levels found in their\nsurrounding environment, therefore they could be potential vectors of these contaminants to biota.\nHowever, a consensus on MPs as vectors of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) has not been reached\nsince are opposing views among different researchers on this topic. However, all agree that more\nextensive studies are needed to clarify this relationship. This review reunites information reporting the\nfactors that drive the sorption dynamics between MPs and POPs, which essentially corresponds to\npolymer properties and surrounding environmental variables. Furthermore, this review highlights\nseveral supporting and rebuttal arguments in the direction to clear up the real hazard enforced by the\npresence of MPs in marine environments.", "Daftar File": {"2018_EJRNL_PP_JOANA_PATRICIO_RODRIGUES_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/149474"}, "Penulis": "undefined [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Armando C.
