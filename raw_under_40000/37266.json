{"Nomor": 37266, "Judul": "Vertical urbanisms: Opening up geographies of the three-dimensional city", "Abstrak": "This paper develops a more diverse and multi-dimensional agenda for understanding and researching urban\nverticality. In particular, it argues for vertical geographies that encompass more than issues of security and\nsegregation and are not necessarily framed by the three-dimensional politics of Israel/Palestine identified by\nsome commentators. In opening up a wider world of vertical urbanisms, the paper outlines three key\napproaches: close attention to where urban verticality is theorised and the relationship between power and\nheight, the importance of ethnographic detail to emphasise more everyday verticalities and disrupt top-down\nanalytical perspectives, and geographical imaginations that carefully attend to the myriad spatial entanglements\nof the three-dimensional city.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Andrew Harris [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "verticality, ordinary cities, volume, mobile urbanisms, topology", "Sumber": "Progress in Human Geography 2015, Vol. 39(5) 601\u2013620 sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Mar 2019"}
