{"Nomor": 35069, "Judul": "Impact of Nasser Lake on gravity reduction and geoidal heights for Egypt", "Abstrak": "In the course of the IAG African Geoid Project, it is needed to study the impact of the lakes on the gravity\nreduction and geoidal heights. The aim of this paper is to study the impact of the water in Nasser Lake on gravity\nreduction and geoidal heights for Egypt. The determination of the gravimetric geoid is based on the well-known\nremove-restore technique. The problem of the lakes occurs because the popular programs widely used in practice\n(e.g., TC-program (Forsberg, 1984)) assume that all positive elevations are filled with rock topography, and all\nnegative elevations are filled with ocean water. This is, however, not true for the case of Nasser Lake, which lies\ncompletely above sea level, at about 180m elevation, with a water depth of about 20 m. The paper presents an\napproach on estimating the impact of Nasser Lake on gravity reduction and geoidal heights using TC-program\nwith some tricky cases. The results show that the impact of Nasser Lake on both gravity anomalies and geoid\nundulation is limited to the area of the lake. The impact of Nasser Lake on the gravity anomalies is in the order of\nsub mgal, while the impact of Nasser lake on the geoid undulation is significant and reaches few centimeters.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hussein A.
