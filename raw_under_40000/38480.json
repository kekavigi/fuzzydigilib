{"Nomor": 38480, "Judul": "Atomically Precise, Thiolated Copper?Hydride Nanoclusters as Single-Site Hydrogenation Catalysts for Ketones in Mild Conditions", "Abstrak": "Copper?hydrides are known catalysts for several\ntechnologically important reactions such as hydrogenation of\nCO, hydroamination of alkenes and alkynes, and chemoselective hydrogenation of unsaturated ketones to unsaturated\nalcohols. Stabilizing copper-based particles by ligand chemistry\nto nanometer scale is an appealing route to make active\ncatalysts with optimized material economy; however, it has\nbeen long believed that the ligand?metal interface, particularly\nif sulfur-containing thiols are used as stabilizing agent, may\npoison the catalyst. We report here a discovery of an ambientstable thiolate-protected copper?hydride nanocluster\n[Cu25H10(SPhCl2)18]3? that readily catalyzes hydrogenation of\nketones to alcohols in mild conditions. A full experimental and theoretical characterization of its atomic and electronic\nstructure shows that the 10 hydrides are instrumental for the stability of the nanocluster and are in an active role being\ncontinuously consumed and replenished in the hydrogenation reaction. Density functional theory computations suggest,\nbacked up by the experimental evidence, that the hydrogenation takes place only around a single site of the 10 hydride\nlocations, rendering the [Cu25H10(SPhCl2)18]3? one of the first nanocatalysts whose structure and catalytic functions are\ncharacterized fully to atomic precision. Understanding of a working catalyst at the atomistic level helps to optimize its\nproperties and provides fundamental insights into the controversial issue of how a stable, ligand-passivated, metalcontaining nanocluster can be at the same time an active catalyst.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Cunfa Sun 1.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/169767"}, "Penulis": "Cunfa Sun [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Cunfa SunNisha MammenSami KaappaPeng YuanGuocheng DengChaowei ZhaoJuanzhu YanSami MalolaKaroliina HonkalaHannu H\u00e4kkinen*Boon K.
