{"Nomor": 33115, "Judul": "HOW DIFFICULT IS IT TO PREPARE A QUANTUM STATE?", "Abstrak": "Consider a quantum system prepared in an input state. One wants to drive it into a target state. Assuming\nclassical states and operations as free resources, I identify a geometric cost function which quantifies the\ndifficulty of the protocol in terms of how different it is from a classical process. The quantity determines a\nlower bound to the number of commuting unitary transformations required to complete the task. I then\ndiscuss the link between the quantum character of a state preparation and the amount of coherence and\nquantum correlations that are created in the target state.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "DAVIDE GIROLAMI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 122, 010505 (2019), \u00a9 2019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Jan 2019"}
