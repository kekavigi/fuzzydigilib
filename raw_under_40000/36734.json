{"Nomor": 36734, "Judul": "FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS OF THE REDISPATCH OPERATION IN CASE OF 5% CONTINGENCY FUEL REQUIREMENT                       (CASE STUDY : PT GARUDA INDONESIA (PERSERO) TBK.)", "Abstrak": "During a flight operations, an aircraft will carry contingency fuel. This is an extra fuel to cover navigational errors, enroute weather, and any reasons contributing to the increase in trip fuel beyond the predicted fuel burn. Based on CASR 121.639, the amount of contingency fuel is 5% of the trip fuel, which is the fuel to enable the aircraft to fly from take-off until landing. Before 2015, the amount of contingency fuel is 10% of the trip fuel. Redispatch operation is a procedure used to reduce the contingency fuel load needed on a flight, so that the aircraft carry more payloads. In a redispatch operation, at the departure airport, the aircraft is released to depart not to the actual destination (intended destination), but to a closer airport (initial destination). At a point before initial destination called Point of Redispatch (POR), the crew will check whether the remaining fuel on board is enough to continue the flight to the intended destination. According to the FAA Opspec B044, the amount of contingency fuel that the aircraft must carry in flight is 10% of the trip fuel.\nThe objective of this thesis are to determine the minimum flight time based on the old and new regulation for contingency fuel, and to analyze the feasibility of implementing redispatch operation at Garuda Indonesia. According to Staff Instruction SI(O)120-03 issued in 2001, stated that in general, planned redispatch is used on international flights scheduled for more than 6 hours. This flight time is used as the minimum flight time reference for the old regulation for normal contingency fuel (10% of the trip fuel). \nTo be able to determine the flight time, a calculation of fuel consumption and payload that can be transported using both normal and redispatch operation is needed through a flight plan developed and simulated in NAVTECH software.  The difference between the redispatch payload and normal payload called as payload increase. From the simulation results on 10 routes served by Garuda Indonesia\u2019s B777-300ER and A330-200, a plot of payload increase vs intended trip is made. From the plot, the minimum flight time obtained using the old normal contingency fuel (10% of trip fuel) is 6.17 hours for B777-300ER and 6.01 hours for A330-200. This results also proves the statement on the Staff Instruction. Meanwhile, for the new normal contingency fuel (5% of trip fuel), the B777-300ER requires 16.88 hours to be profitable in redispatch operation and the A330-200 needs 17.72 hours. From this results, it can be concluded that none of the Garuda Indonesia\u2019s flight routes can meet the minimum flight time for the new normal contingency fuel requirements.", "Daftar File": {"2019_TA_PP_JOSHUA_ALFRED_HASUDUNGAN_1_-_ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/162902"}, "Penulis": "Joshua Alfred Hasudungan [13615054]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
