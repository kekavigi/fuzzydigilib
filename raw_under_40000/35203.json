{"Nomor": 35203, "Judul": "Nanofiltration systems and applications in wastewater treatment: Review article", "Abstrak": "Nanofiltration membrane (NF) is one of the most important activities employed in wastewater treatment\nfield. It is a relatively recent development in membrane technology and it can be aqueous or nonaqueous.\nCharacteristics of NF fall between UF and RO, and functions by both pore-size flow (convective)\nand the solution-diffusion mechanisms. Membrane charges play an important role in membrane function\nand often NF membrane as have surface negative charges. NF technique is used in a variety of water and\nwastewater treatment (WWT) in different industrial applications. The main job of NF is the selective\nremoval of ions and organic substances and it is used in some specified seawater desalination application.\nThe main objective of this review is to illustrate the main applications of NF process in water reuse, WWT\nas tertiary treatment, water softening and desalination fields. Comparison of basic economic analyses\nwith other alternative processes in profitability is also performed.\n 2018 Ain Shams University. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.
