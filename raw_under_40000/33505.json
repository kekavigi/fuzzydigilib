{"Nomor": 33505, "Judul": "QUANTUM ENGINE BASED ON MANY-BODY LOCALIZATION", "Abstrak": "Many-body-localized (MBL) systems do not thermalize under their intrinsic dynamics. The athermality of\nMBL, we propose, can be harnessed for thermodynamic tasks. We illustrate this ability by formulating an\nOtto engine cycle for a quantum many-body system. The system is ramped between a strongly localized MBL regime and a thermal (or weakly localized) regime. The difference between the energy-level correlations of MBL systems and of thermal systems enables mesoscale engines to run in parallel in the thermodynamic limit, enhances the engine\u2019s reliability, and suppresses worst-case trials. We estimate analytically and calculate numerically the engine\u2019s efficiency and per-cycle power. The efficiency mirrors the efficiency of the conventional thermodynamic Otto engine. The per-cycle power scales linearly with the system size and inverse-exponentially with a localization length. This work introduces a thermodynamic lens onto MBL, which, having been studied much recently, can now be considered for use in thermodynamic tasks.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "NICOLE YUNGER HALPERN   [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["CHRISTOPHER DAVID WHITE,", "SARANG GOPALAKRISHNAN,", "AND GIL REFAEL"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW B 99, 024203 (2019); \u00a92019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Jan 2019"}
