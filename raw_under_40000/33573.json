{"Nomor": 33573, "Judul": "Impacts of Biofilm Formation on the Fate and Potential Effects of Microplastic in the Aquatic Environment", "Abstrak": "In the aquatic environment, microplastic (MP;\n<5 mm) is a cause of concern because of its persistence and\npotential adverse effects on biota. Studies of microlitter\nimpacts are mostly based on virgin and spherical polymer\nparticles as model MP. However, in pelagic and benthic\nenvironments, surfaces are always colonized by microorganisms forming so-called biofilms. The influence of such biofilms\non the fate and potential effects of MP is not understood well.\nHere, we review the physical interactions of early microbial\ncolonization on plastic surfaces and their reciprocal influence\non the weathering processes and vertical transport as well as\nsorption and release of contaminants by MP. Possible\necological consequences of biofilm formation on MP, such\nas trophic transfer of MP particles and potential adverse effects of MP, are virtually unknown. However, evidence is accumulating\nthat the biofilm?plastic interactions have the capacity to influence the fate and impacts of MP by modifying the physical\nproperties of the particles. There is an urgent research need to better understand these interactions and increase the ecological\nrelevance of current laboratory testing by simulating field conditions in which microbial life is a key driver of biogeochemical\nprocesses.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Christoph D.
