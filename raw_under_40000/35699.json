{"Nomor": 35699, "Judul": "How Do Surfactants Control the Agglomeration of Clathrate Hydrates?", "Abstrak": "Clathrate hydrates can spontaneously form under typical conditions found in oil and gas pipelines. The agglomeration of clathrates into large solid masses plugs the pipelines, posing adverse safety, economic, and environmental threats. Surfactants are customarily used to prevent the aggregation of clathrate particles and their coalescence with water droplets. It is generally assumed that a large contact angle between the surfactant-covered clathrate and water is a key predictor of the antiagglomerant performance of the surfactant.......", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Pavithra M.
