{"Nomor": 36336, "Judul": "Comparative Study of Ethylene Carbonate-Based ElectrolyteDecomposition at Li, Ca, and Al Anode Interfaces", "Abstrak": "One of the major bottlenecks to the develop-ment of alternatives to existing Li ion battery technology, suchas Li metal or multivalent ion (Mg, Ca, Zn, or Al) batteries,has to do with the layer of inorganic and organic compoundsthat forms at the interface between the metallic anode andelectrolyte via solvent and salt decomposition (the solid?electrolyte interphase or SEI). In Li metal batteries the growthof dendrites causes continual formation of new SEI, while inmultivalent ion batteries the SEI does not allow for thediffusion of the ions. Finding appropriate electrolytes for suchsystems and gaining an understanding of SEI formation is therefore critical to the development of secondary Li metal andmultivalent ion cells. In this work, we useab initiomolecular dynamics simulations to investigate the initial stages ofdecomposition of organic electrolytes based on ethylene carbonate (EC) and formation of the SEI on Li, Ca, and Al metalsurfaces. Wefirstfind that pure EC only decomposes to CO and C2H4O22?species on each type of surface. However, when a saltmolecule is introduced to form an electrolyte, a second EC decomposition route resulting in the formation of CO32?and C2H4begins to occur; furthermore, a variety of different inorganic compounds, depending on the chemical composition of the salt,form on the surfaces. Finally, wefind that EC breaks down more quickly on Li and Ca surfaces than on Al and show that this isbecause the rate of charge transfer is much faster owing to their lower electronegativity and ionization energies. The molecularlevel understanding of decomposition and SEI formation generated by this computational modeling can lead to the design ofnew electrolytes for beyond-Li ion batteries.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Joshua_Young_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/162039"}, "Penulis": "Joshua Young [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Peter M.
