{"Nomor": 36169, "Judul": "Study On The Fragmentation Of Granite Due To The Impact Of Single Particle And Double Particles", "Abstrak": "Particle Impact Drilling (PID) is a novel method to improve the rate of penetration (ROP). In order to\nfurther improve the performance of PID, an investigation into the effect of single and double\nparticles: (1) diameter; (2) initial velocity; (3) distance; and (4) angle of incidence was undertaken\nto investigate their effects on broken volume and penetration depth into hard brittle rock. For this\npurpose, the laboratory experiment of single particle impact rock was employed. Meanwhile, based\non the LS-DYNA, a new finite element (FE) simulation of the PID, including single and double\nparticles impact rock, has been presented. The 3-dimensional (3D), aix-symmetric, dynamicexplicit, Lagrangian model has been considered in this simulation. And the Elastic and Holmquist\nJohnson Cook (HJC) material behaviors have been used for particles and rocks, respectively. The FE\nsimulation results of single particle impacting rock are good agreement with experimental data.\nFurthermore, in this article the optimal impact parameters, including diameter, initial velocity,\ndistance and the angle of incidence, are obtained in PID.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yuchun Kuang  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wei Lin", "Xiaofeng Xu", "Yonghui Liu", "Kaisong Wu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Particle impact drilling, Dynamics, SHPB test, Simulation, Rock breaking mechanism", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 3, Pages 267-272 (September  2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Mar 2019"}
