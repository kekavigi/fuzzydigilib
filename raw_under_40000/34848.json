{"Nomor": 34848, "Judul": "Advanced strategies to improve nitrification process in sequencing batch reactors - A review", "Abstrak": "The optimization of biological nitrogen removal (BNR) in sequencing batch reactors has become the aim\nof researchers worldwide in order to increase efficiency and reduce energy and operating costs. This\nresearch has focused on the nitrification phase as the limiting reaction rate of BNR. This paper analyzes\ndifferent strategies and discusses different tools such as: factors for achieving partial nitrification, realtime control and monitoring for detecting characteristic patterns of nitrification/denitrification as endpoints, use of modeling based on activated sludge models, and the use of data-driven modeling for\nestimating variables that cannot be easily measured experimentally or online. The discussion of this\npaper highlight the properties and scope of each of these strategies, as well as their advantages and\ndisadvantages, which can be integrated into future works using these strategies according to legal and\neconomic restrictions for a more stable and efficient BNR process in the long-term.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Francisco Jaramillo [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Marcos Orchard .,Carlos Munoz .,Mauricio Zamorano"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Partial nitrification SBR ASM Bending-points Data-driven models", "Sumber": "Journal of Environmental Management 218 (2018) 154e164", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Feb 2019"}
