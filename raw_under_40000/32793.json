{"Nomor": 32793, "Judul": "An Overview Of Case-Based Reasoning Applications In Drilling Engineering", "Abstrak": "Application-oriented research in the area of case-based reasoning has moved\nmature research results into practical applications. This paper presents an overview of different applications of case-based reasoning (CBR) in petroleum engineering, with focus on the\ndrilling process, based on a survey and comparative evaluation of different applications. The\nnumbers of papers, research groups, and experimental systems are indicative of the importance, need, and growth of CBR in different industries. A clear growing trend has been seen\nin the oil and gas industry over the last 5\u201310 years. In this paper we present the evolving\nstory of CBR applied to problems in drilling engineering. We show that drilling engineering\nis an application domain in which the systematic storage and situation-triggered reuse of\npast concrete experiences provide significant support to drilling personnel at various levels.\nSome CBR systems have been successfully deployed in operational settings. With increased\nunderstanding of the complexity of drilling operations and continuous development of CBR\nand combined methods, the future potential is significantly higher", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SAMAD VALIPOUR SHOKOUHI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["P\u00e5l Skalle,  Agnar Aamodt"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Case-based reasoning \u00b7 Decision support \u00b7 Petroleum engineering \u00b7 Oil well drilling", "Sumber": "Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011, Artif Intell Rev (2014) 41:317\u2013329 DOI 10.1007/s10462-011-9310-2", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "03 Jan 2019"}
