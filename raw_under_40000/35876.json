{"Nomor": 35876, "Judul": "Cubism and the Fourth Dimension", "Abstrak": "This article revisits the historiography of Cubism and mathematics, with a particular focus on Pablo Picasso\u2019s uses of geometry at the end of the firstdecade of the twentieth century. In particular, I consider the artistic appropriation of the concept of the fourth dimension, and its pictorial uses as a conduit for a conceptual reformulation of pictorial space. I investigate Picasso\u2019s distinctive adoption of this geometric framework in relation to one of his 1909 experiments across painting and photography, and advocate the possibility of drawing novel historiographical lessons from Picasso\u2019s work lessons\nthat bring the historiography of Cubism in a closer dialogue with recent debates in the historiography of science. I conclude with an appeal to consider the continued relevance of this past experiment in art and science when asses- sing the contemporary drive toward art-science collaborations, and use the\ncase of Cubism and the fourth dimension as a springboard for a critical reflection on the future directions of art-science collaborations", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Chiara Ambrosio [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "cubism, fourth dimension, art and science, interdisciplinarity", "Sumber": "INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE REVIEWS, Vol. 41 Nos. 2 \u2013 3, June \u2013 September 2016, 202 \u2013 221", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Mar 2019"}
