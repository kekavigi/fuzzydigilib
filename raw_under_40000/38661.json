{"Nomor": 38661, "Judul": "Beyond property: Industrial estates and post-suburban transformation in Jakarta Metropolitan Region", "Abstrak": "Past studies on urbanization in East Asia in general and in Indonesia in particular have taken the edge of\nlarge cities as the extension of the metropolitan core where the zones of urban\u2013rural transition take\nshape.

Jakarta Metropolitan Region (JMR) is beginning\nto join the global trend of post-suburbia, which refers to the decentralization of urban life to the outskirts\nof a metropolis. Several post-suburban elements in JMR are identified in this article, including planned\ndeconcentration of hi-tech industries and multinational companies, followed by the growth of projects\nbeyond land and property development, including suburban cultural centers with a Western flavor.\nDespite these commonalities, this article argues that post-suburbia in JMR has its own uniqueness due\nto the reduced carrying capacity of the metropolitan core, the persistent yet relatively passive influence\nof the state", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Delik Hudalah [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Perencanaan Wilayah dan Kota", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Arsitektur, Perencanaan dan Pengembangan Kebijakan", "Subjek": "Area planning", "Kata Kunci": "Industrial estate Jakarta Post-suburbia Suburbanization Urban deconcentration", "Sumber": "Cities 29 (2012) 40 \u201348", "Staf Input/Edit": "Rd.
