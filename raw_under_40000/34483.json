Globalization  has  caused  changes  in  public  consideration  of  social  relationships  and  everyday  life.  These  social  changes  have  led  to  significant  and  profound  effects  on  popular  \u201chandicrafts\u201d  which  is  one  of  the  vivid  indicators  of  a  nation\u2019s  culture.  Globalization  offers  novel  opportunities  to  handicrafts,  yet  it  has  presented some challenges to these crafts as well. The current study is aimed to investigate the interaction of globalization and Persian\n handicrafts, by a theoretical approach and analytical method. By studying the elements  of  globalization  and  Persian  handicrafts,  this  research  concludes  handicrafts  should  not  be  a  \npassive  phenomenon  towards  this  widespread  process,  but  by  taking  advantages  of  the  opportunities  created  by  globalization  and  also  by  eliminating  threats,  Persian  handicrafts  could  expose  their  multiple  abilities to make a positive interaction with globalization.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "S.
