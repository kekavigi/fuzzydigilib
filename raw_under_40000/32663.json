In this research, curvelet transform\nwas employed in channel edge enhancement, owing to its high ability to depict curve edges. The default parameters\nof curvelet transform were used to decompose the data. Hence, there are 6 scales and 16 directions in the\n2nd level of decomposition for the real data of this study. Utilizing themodified top-hat algorithm,we calculated\nthemaximumcurvelet coefficients in all sub-bands. Employing top-hat in curvelet domain ismore effective than\nthe soft or hard thresholding to enhance the channel edges. Channel edges were further detected through morphological\ngradient algorithm with multi-length and multi-direction structuring elements. A directional feature\nof the proposed structuring element rendered the curvelet morphological gradient method used in the edge detection.\nFinal edgemap resulting fromthe weighted average of all sub-edge imageswas obtained fromthe structuring\nelements. Channel edge detection by the morphological gradient creates a large number of false edges.\nHowever, the combination of the morphological gradient with the curvelet transform eliminates many of\nthose artifacts. The proposed algorithmwas applied to both synthetic and real seismic data set containing channels.\nThe findings resulted in a proper channel edge map as good as Canny, Sobel, and Laplacian of Gaussian edge\ndetectors.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Bahareh Boustani [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Abdolrahim Javaherian, Mjid Nabi-Bidhendi, Siyavash Torabi, Hamid Reza Amindavar"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Channel edge Curvelet transform Top-hat Morphological gradient", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 160 (2019) 57\u201368, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.11.004", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Des 2018"}
