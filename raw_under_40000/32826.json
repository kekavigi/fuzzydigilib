{"Nomor": 32826, "Judul": "Price-performance evaluation of thermal conductivity enhancement of nanofluids with different particle sizes", "Abstrak": "The nanofluid\u2019s thermal conductivity has been one of the most fascinating topics for researchers in this\nfield. So far, a large number of aqueous, non-aqueous and also oleic nanofluids are experimentally studied.\nThese nanofluids have been investigated with different volume fractions, various particle sizes and\ndifferent production methods. But, the question seems to be very important now is that among available\nnanofluids, which one can meet our needs better? What particle sizes will work best for a chosen\nnanoparticle? Whether pure experimental measuring is reliable for using a nanofluid in the industry\nor not? Two nanofluids of Fe and MgO in Ethylene Glycol base-fluid with various particle sizes have been\nprobed in this research, and the preparation cost of these nanofluids is compared with their thermal\nperformance and proportionate responses are given to above questions. As well, a correlation is provided\nin order to measure thermal conductivity of nanofluids in terms of thermal conductivity, particle size,\ntemperature and volume fraction of nanoparticles, and the data were compared with the result obtained\nfrom a neural network modeling.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ali Alirezaie [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mohammad Hadi Hajmohammad, Mohammad Reza Hassani Ahangar, Mohammad Hemmat Esfe"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Heat transfer, Nanofluid, Thermal conductivity, Price-performance analysis, Artificial neural network, Modeling", "Sumber": "Science Direct", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Jan 2019"}
