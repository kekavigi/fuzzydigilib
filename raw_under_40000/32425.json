{"Nomor": 32425, "Judul": "Voids and bodies: August Schmarsow, Bruno Zevi and space as a historiographical theme", "Abstrak": "The understanding that the concept of space should constitute one of the major concerns of architectural theory was first articulated in the work of August Schmarsow, and from Schmarsow's writings this notion came to dominate twentieth-century modernist architecture. In this paper I analyze the historiographical implications of this emphasis on spatial concerns by comparing Schmarsow\u2019s theoretical positions with Bruno Zevi\u2019s historiographical work. Schmarsow and Zevi are separated by half a century; while they lived and worked within different cultural contexts, they both emphasized the notion of space and theorized the implications of this emphasis for architecture and its historiography. Their juxtaposition consequently enables wider discussions on the role of abstract and embodied aspects of spatiality and how these aspects can be treated within the field of architectural history.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "JOHANNA GULLBERG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Architecture", "Kata Kunci": "Space, historiography, August Schmarsow, Bruno Zevi", "Sumber": "Journal of Art Historiography  Number 14 June  2016", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur \u00a0\n                                     Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
