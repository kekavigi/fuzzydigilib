{"Nomor": 32930, "Judul": "Enhanced Application For FSRU Recondensing Equipment During Periods Of Low Or No Gas Send Out To Minimize Lng Cargo Losses", "Abstrak": "Most modern floating storage and regasification units (FSRU) are fitted with recondensing equipment\nthat feed condensed boil-off gas (BOG) to the regasification unit in addition to a stream of liquefied\nnatural gas (LNG) extracted from the cargo tanks. Use of the recondenser during regasification operations\nreduces gas losses on FSRU. It does so by avoiding consumption of excess BOG, with no associated\ncommercial benefit, in gas combustion units (GCU), steam dumps, flares etc. Here we consider the\nbenefits of also using the recondenser in recirculation mode, returning condensed BOG to the cargo tanks\nin the form of slightly warmed LNG. Such recirculation can be beneficial during periods of low or no gas\nsend out from the FSRU, often achieving significant reductions in gas losses, although it is not standard\npractice in the industry to do so. Once regasification is halted not much BOG is required by the FSRU\nengine room, so the vessel must handle this excess. By condensing the BOG to LNG and returning it to the\ncargo tanks, the significant volume reduction involved has the beneficial impact of slowing down tank\npressure increase. The saturated vapor pressure (SVP) of the LNG, linked to its composition and temperature, plays a key role in the boil-off rate and resulting cargo tank pressure changes. Detailed analysis\nis provided to explain how using the FSRU recondenser in recirculation mode can be best exploited by\nconsidering the prevailing fill levels, temperatures and pressures in each of the cargo tanks, and\nreturning the condensed LNG preferentially to certain tanks. FSRU efficiency can be improved, gas losses\nand emissions can be reduced, and more cargo sold by exploiting the capabilities of the FSRU recondenser in recirculation mode. Running the FSRU in recirculation mode requires no equipment modifications to standard recondensers, neither does it increase FSRU operating costs", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MAKSYM KULITSA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["David A.
