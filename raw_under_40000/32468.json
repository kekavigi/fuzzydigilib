This paper presents an efficient uncertainty assessment workflow\nof geological and production data through the cyclic CO2-assisted gravity drainage (GAGD) process in South Rumaila oil\nfield in Southern Iraq. First, the sequential Gaussian simulation created a large number of reservoir stochastic realizations\nthat capture the entire geological uncertainty space. Second, ranking was applied to select the quartiles (P10, P20, \u2026, P90) of\nreservoir permeability and anisotropy ratio to quantify the geological uncertainty. Next, the equation of state-compositional\nflow model was constructed to evaluate these realizations by calculating the reservoir flow response. Then, 81 designed\nsimulations were created by factorial design considering the combined realizations of permeability and anisotropy ratio.\nIn a successive step, the most-likely model was considered for the uncertainty quantification of the operational decision\nparameters through the cyclic GAGD process to restrict the uncertainty space, which leads to obtain the true optimal scenario. The cyclic GAGD operational parameters include durations of injection, soaking, and production and the minimum\nbottom hole pressure in production wells. The compositional reservoir flow model was again used to evaluate the multiple\nsimulations created by the proxy-based Box\u2013Behnken design and Monte Carlo simulation. The combined geological and\nproduction uncertainty workflow gave an idea about the uncertainty or risk space of the predicted reservoir flow response\nin the future cyclic GAGD process performance.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "WATHEQ J.
