{"Nomor": 38606, "Judul": "Template-Free Synthesis of Alkaline Earth Vanad", "Abstrak": "Currently, industrial wastes are typically combusted at\nincineration plants, and the resulting ashes are sent to landfill. This\npractice raises issues, such as potential toxicity of the leachate to the\nenvironment, as well as the loss of valuable metals left in the waste.\nTherefore, from both economic and environmental standpoints, it is\nbecoming increasingly important to recover valuable metals from\nindustrial waste. In this work, a transformative recovery of vanadium\n(conversion nearly 100%) from leaching solutions of carbon black waste\n(metal leaching efficiency > 97%) which originates from oil refineries in\nSingapore, has been systematically studied. Interestingly, three distinctive\nalkaline earth vanadate nanomaterials were successfully synthesized from\nthe leaching solutions by a facile hydrothermal process, that is, singlecrystal calcium vanadate nanorods (Ca10V6O25) oriented along the [001]\ndirection, strontium vanadate nanorods with ellipsoid-like assembly\n(Sr10V6O25), and barium vanadate polyhedral nanoparticles (Ba3V2O8). Importantly, we have demonstrated that this facile\nmetal recovery route enables the morphology control of vanadate nanomaterials without templates in the system. Moreover, the\nvanadate nanomaterials obtained are potential wide band gap semiconductors for electronic devices and semiconducting glasses.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Guowu Zhan 1.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170039"}, "Penulis": "Guowu Zhan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wei Cheng Ng, Shin Nuo Koh, Chi-Hwa Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "Nanomaterials, Carbon black waste, Leaching, Vanadium recovery, Oil refinery", "Sumber": "ACS Sustainable Chem.
