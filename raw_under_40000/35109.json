{"Nomor": 35109, "Judul": "Biosensors for wastewater monitoring: A review", "Abstrak": "Water pollution and habitat degradation are the cause of increasing water scarcity and decline in aquatic biodiversity. While the freshwater availability has been declining through past decades, water demand has continued to increase particularly in areas with arid and semi-arid climate. Monitoring of pollutants in wastewater\neffluents are critical to identifying water pollution area for treatment. Conventional detection methods are not\neffective in tracing multiple harmful components in wastewater due to their variability along different times and\nsources. Currently, the development of biosensing instruments attracted significant attention because of their\nhigh sensitivity, selectivity, reliability, simplicity, low-cost and real-time response. This paper provides a general\noverview on reported biosensors, which have been applied for the recognition of important organic chemicals,\nheavy metals, and microorganisms in dark waters. The significance and successes of nanotechnology in the field\nof biomolecular detection are also reviewed. The commercially available biosensors and their main challenges in\nwastewater monitoring are finally discussed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Fatemeh Ejeian [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Parisa Etedali.,a , Hajar-Alsadat Mansouri-Tehrani., Asieh Soozanipour.,Ze-Xian Low.,Mohsen Asadnia.,Asghar Taheri-Kafrania., Amir Razmjou"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Wastewater monitoring Organic materials Heavy metals Microorganisms Biosensor", "Sumber": "Biosensors and Bioelectronics 118 (2018) 66\u201379", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Feb 2019"}
