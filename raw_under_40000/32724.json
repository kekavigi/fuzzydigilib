It is found that on the assumption that the surface energy\nis not positive semi-definite, the solution can be non-unique. Several examples are given for sim-\nple spherically-symmetric and axisymmetric FGM bodies with surface effects characterized by\nGurtin-Murdoch surface elasticity. The results show that the conditions for non-uniqueness of\nsolution emerge when the magnitude of negative effective surface modulus is of the order of a\ncharacteristic dimension of the problem multiplied by the bulk modulus near the surface, which\nis quite different from that for homogeneous materials.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jun Zhu, Weiqiu Chen, Jiqing Jiang, Jun Zeng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "functionally graded material, surface theory, non-uniqueness, elasticity", "Sumber": "Science Direct", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Jan 2019"}
