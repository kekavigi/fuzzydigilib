{"Nomor": 37185, "Judul": "Achievement of Reactor-Relevant Performance in Negative Triangularity Shape in the DIII-D Tokamak", "Abstrak": "Plasma discharges with a negative triangularity (? \u00bc ?0.4) shape have been created in the DIII-D\ntokamak with a significant normalized beta (?N \u00bc 2.7) and confinement characteristic of the high\nconfinement mode (H98y2 \u00bc 1.2) despite the absence of an edge pressure pedestal and no edge localized\nmodes (ELMs). These inner-wall-limited plasmas have a similar global performance as a positive\ntriangularity (? \u00bc \u00fe0.4) ELMing H-mode discharge with the same plasma current, elongation and cross\nsectional area. For cases both of dominant electron cyclotron heating with Te=Ti > 1 and dominant neutral\nbeam injection heating with Te=Ti \u00bc 1, turbulent fluctuations over radii 0.5 < ? < 0.9 were reduced by\n10\u201350% in the negative triangularity shape compared to the matching positive triangularity shape,\ndepending on the radius and conditions.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "M.
