These SPM effects, which constitute a major geological noise, manifest themselves as\nslowly decaying EM responses at late times yielding elevated time constant values that can be misinterpreted\nto be caused by strong conductors such as Ni-sulphide mineralized bodies. Therefore, their identification and\ndiscrimination from conductive sources response is crucial before any follow-up actions. In this paper, we\ndescribe the effectiveness of an innovative dual EM receiver for attenuating SPM effects, the use of a robust\nmulti-criteria discrimination approach and an enhanced predictive technique for identifying and discriminating\nthe SPM effects from the conductive sources response observed in VTEM\u2122 data of Greenland. The proposed\napproach applied to the airborne EM data collected between 2012 and 2015 has allowed classifying approximately\n50% of anomalies as SPM effects, thus aiding in a more reliable prioritization of non-SPM related EM anomalies\nbeginning in 2015.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Nasreddine Bournas  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sharon Taylor, Alexander Prikhodko, Geoffrey Plastow, Karl Kwan, Jean Legault, Paolo Berardelli"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Superparamagnetic SPM Multi-criteria Dual EM receiver Predictive techniques Greenland VTEM\u2122", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 145 (2017) 59\u201373, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.07.012", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Mar 2019"}
