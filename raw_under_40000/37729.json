{"Nomor": 37729, "Judul": "Localized surfaces of three-dimensional topological insulators", "Abstrak": "We study the surface of a three-dimensional spin chiral Z2 topological insulator (class CII), demonstrating the possibility of its localization. This arises through an interplay of interaction and statistically symmetric disorder that confines the gapless fermionic degrees of freedom to a network of one-dimensional helical domain walls that can be localized. We identify two distinct regimes of this gapless insulating phase, a \u201cclogged\u201d regime wherein the network localization is induced by its junctions between otherwise metallic helical domain walls, and a \u201cfully localized\u201d regime of localized domain walls. The experimental signatures of these regimes are also discussed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yang-Zhi Chou [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Rahul M.
