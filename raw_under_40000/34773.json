{"Nomor": 34773, "Judul": "The Temperature Regime of the Proposed Landing Sites for the Luna-Glob Mission in the South Polar Region of the Moon", "Abstrak": "In this paper, we investigated the possibility of existence of the hydrogen-containing volatile compounds, similar to those found in the Cabeus crater, in the area of the proposed landing ellipses of the Luna-Glob mission. We found that the existence of water ice and other hydrogen-containing substances is possible only in the presence of a shielding layer of regolith. The time of existence of such deposits does not exceed several tens or hundreds years for a layer of regolith with a thickness of 0.4 m and several thousand years for a layer of regolith 1 m thick.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP E.
