{"Nomor": 37327, "Judul": "Pedestrian Behavior at Signalized Pedestrian Crossings", "Abstrak": "The objective of this research was to define eventual differences in models of pedestrian behavior at signalized pedestrian crossings, with and without countdown displays. The outcomes of this work represent a contribution to the harmonization of positions on the effect of a countdown display on pedestrian behavior. Video recordings at two completely similar pedestrian crossings enabled\nthe collection of pedestrian behavior data (crossing at the red light), which included different categories (gender, age, individual/group, and \u201cslow\u201d pedestrians), collected in different conditions (during certain red light intervals and traffic volume). The results of the research showed that a statistically significant larger number of pedestrian offenders occurred at pedestrian crossings without countdown displays\nrather than at crossings with countdown displays. The presence of a countdown display significantly reduced the number of women offenders in particular. The number of offenders in the first and last four seconds of the pedestrian red light at the pedestrian crossing with a countdown\ndisplay, differed, in terms of statistical significance, from the number of offenders at the crossing without a countdown display. The countdown display had a positive influence on pedestrians older than 40 years of age, as well as on slow pedestrians.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Krsto Lipovac [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Milan Vujanic", "Bojan Maric", "and Miladin Nesic"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Pedestrian Behavior at Signalized Pedestrian Crossings", "Sumber": "JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING \u00a9 ASCE / FEBRUARY 2013", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Mar 2019"}
