{"Nomor": 37778, "Judul": "Hyperbolic fracton model, subsystem symmetry, and holography", "Abstrak": "We propose that the fracton models with subsystem symmetry can be a class of toy models for the holographic principle. The discovery of the anti\u2013de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence as a concrete construction of holography and the subsequent developments including the subregion duality and Ryu-Takayanagi formula of entanglement entropy have revolutionized our understanding of quantum gravity and provided powerful tool sets for solving various strongly coupled quantum field theory problems. To resolve many mysteries of holography, toy models can be very helpful. One example is the holographic tensor networks, which illuminate the quantum-error-correcting properties of gravity in the anti\u2013de Sitter space. In this work we discuss a classical toy model featuring subsystem symmetries and immobile fracton excitations.We show that such a model defined on the hyperbolic lattice satisfies some key properties of the holographic correspondence. The correct subregion duality and Ryu-Takayanagi formula for mutual information are established for a connected boundary region. A naively defined black hole\u2019s entropy scales as its horizon area. We also present discussions on corrections for more complicated boundary subregions, the possible generalizations of the model, and a comparison with the\nholographic tensor networks.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Han Yan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW B 99, 155126 (2019); \u00a92019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "16 Apr 2019"}
