Batch biodegradation was\nfirst carried out using wastewater as the potential substrate for oleaginous Rhodococcus opacus with lipid accumulation intracellular; subsequently, a microfiltration system was applied to recover the bacterial biomass\ngrown as well as for residual chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal from the effluent. The combined process\nshowed excellent results in terms of COD removal from the industrial wastewaters, with the values 56.8%, 46.1%\nand 68.9% for dairy, paper and pulp and biomass gasification wastewaters, respectively, by biodegradation.\nThese values were further improved to 92.7%, 87.6% and 88.2%, respectively, following the microfiltration step\nperformed by employing a low-cost ceramic membrane. In addition, lipids accumulated by the bacterium were\nextracted and characterized for biodiesel production potential. Lipid characterization using 1\nH NMR confirmed\nthe presence of saturated fatty acids. Gas chromatography analysis of the transesterified lipids revealed the\npresence of methyl palmitate and methyl stearate. In addition, the estimated properties of the transesterified\nproduct affirmed its potential for biofuel application.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lalit Goswami [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["R.
