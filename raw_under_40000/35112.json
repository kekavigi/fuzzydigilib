We used some simple and justified assumption along with additional\ninformation that came from static triaxial tests. Large number of used core data significantly reduces uncertainty\nof obtained results. We started from evaluating five components of the stiffness tensor, and then calculated the\nstatic and dynamic moduli and Thomsen's parameters.\nThe proposed method is based on data from three wells located in the Early Paleozoic Baltic Basin in Poland.\nThe parameters were calculated based on data from one reference well-denoted in this paper as A-1. For this\nwell, around 300 m of core was retrieved from the lower Silurian and Ordovician interval and a significant\nnumber of tests were performed on core samples. Results were then validated for the next two wells denoted as\nB-1 and C-1. The obtained model fits quite well with core data, which shows that chosen method proved to be\nefficient.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Micha?
