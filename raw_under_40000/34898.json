{"Nomor": 34898, "Judul": "Outdoor Art: Extraordinary Sculpture Parks and Art in Nature", "Abstrak": "Art historian, writer, and collector Langen\u2019s book comprises various outdoor installations from around the world that the author documented over a two-year period. It explores the reasons art in nature is popular and why private collectors create such spaces. There is a concise representation of 25 private sculptures and landscapes ranging from the United States to New Zealand. Many of the works are located in deserts, forests, mountainous regions, and a few on the ocean floor. As museums and related organizations are unable to procure outdoor pieces of the magnitude presented here, primarily owing to the cost of urban real estate, private collectors are becoming key curators of outdoor art and in many cases utilizing land they own to showcase pieces. The structures are immobile and typically not for sale, creating closer contact between client and artist. The overriding attempt is to build areas that display sculpture and art that blends with or highlights environmental features in a balanced way. VERDICT Any art lover would appreciate Langen\u2019s work, but this title is more for general enthusiasts of landscape design, sculpture, and unconventional displays of art", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "GARY MEDINA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Sculpture, outdoor art", "Sumber": "Library Journal. 2/15/2016, Vol. 141 Issue 3, p99-99. 2/9p", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Feb 2019"}
