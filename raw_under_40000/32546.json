{"Nomor": 32546, "Judul": "Impact of Four Physical Design Factors on Mixed-Income Housing", "Abstrak": "The goal of this study was to survey the impact of design factors upon a mixed percentage of subsidized and market rate units.\nAfter content analysis of research, four physical factors, including unit number, site area, density, and house type, were extracted, and correlation\nanalysis was performed between these factors and the percentage of subsidized units in 45 available mixed-income projects in the United\nStates, Canada, and England. Next, we used frequency and crosstab to obtain the effects of the factors on the percentage of the subsidized units\nin three income levels (low, medium, and high). Findings indicated that when unit number and site area increase, the percentage of subsidized\nunit decreases, and the increase of density increases the percentage of subsidized units. Moreover, in large-scale projects, it is necessary to use\nlower density, and as a result, low-rise houses, while in small-scale projects, different types of houses can be used. Findings of the study clearly\nindicate that in designing and planning the mixed-income projects, we need to attend to physical factors as well as the cultural\u2013social ones.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MEHRNAZ RAMZANPOUR [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["ABDOLMAJID NOURTAGHANI"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Housing & household equipment", "Kata Kunci": "Concentrated poverty; Mixed income; Density; House type; Mix percentage.", "Sumber": "Journal of Architectural Engineering / Volume 25 Issue 1 - March 2019", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
