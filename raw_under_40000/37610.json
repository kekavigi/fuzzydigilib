{"Nomor": 37610, "Judul": "Computationally simple ADPCM based on exponential power estimator", "Abstrak": "Application of the exponential power\nestimation (EPE) technique to develop computationally\nsimple algorithms for adapting the quantiser\nand predictor of an adaptive differential pulse\ncode modulation (ADPCM) system has been\ninvestigated. Performance of this EPE-based\nADPCM system (E-ADPCM) has been studied\nfor first order Gauss-Markov and real speech\ninputs (three sentences) under different channel\nconditions (noise-free and noisy channels), using a\nGaussian non-uniform quantiser at the bit-rate of\n16 kilobits per second (kbit/s). Performance of the\nproposed ADPCM has been compared with that\nof two conventional ADPCM systems. The\nE-ADPCM has a superior performance to the\nconventional systems considered, with a computational\nadvantage of (3N + B + 1) multiplications\n(N being the predictor order and B, the number of\nbits per sample used for quantising the prediction\nerror) and one division per iteration compared\nwith the first system and (B + 1) multiplications\nover the second system, at the cost of one exponentiation.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "G.
