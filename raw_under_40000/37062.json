{"Nomor": 37062, "Judul": "All-Liquid Electroactive Materials for High Energy Density OrganicFlow Battery", "Abstrak": "Nonaqueous redoxflow batteries (RFBs) are a promising energy storagetechnology that enables increased cell voltage and high energy capacity compared toaqueous RFBs. Herein, wefirst report a novel approach to substantially increase theenergy density based on the miscible liquid redox materials 2,5-di-tert-butyl-1-methoxy-4-[2?-methoxyethoxy]benzene catholyte and 2-methylbenzophenone anolyte. This systemhas a high theoretical cell voltage of 2.97 V and a calculated energy density of 223 Wh L?1that is much higher than those of previously reported nonaqueous organic RFBs. Ourreported redoxflow chemistry displays excellent electrochemical performance andstability under cyclic voltammetry, bulk electrolysis, andflow cell conditions. A proof-of-principle RFB delivers a coulombic efficiency of 95% and energy efficiency of 70% andrepresents significant progress toward high energy density RFBs.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Xueqi_Xing_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/163515"}, "Penulis": "Xueqi Xing [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Qinghua Liu,Wenqiang Xu,Wenbin Liang,Junqing Liu,Baoguo Wang,John P.
