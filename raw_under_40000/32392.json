{"Nomor": 32392, "Judul": "Antiphytophthora and antifusarium from Indonesian medicinal plants", "Abstrak": "Phytophthora and Fusarium are two phytopathogenic fungi that\nare frequently faced by farmer. A number of Indonesian medicinal plants have been traditionally used to treat skin diseases\ndue to fungal infection. Some of the Indonesian medicinal plants\nhave been tested and found to be active as antifungal agents.\nThese plants were studied for the capacity to inhibit the growth\nof Phytophthora and Fusarium. The medicinal plants tested included Piper betle leaves, Piper crocatum leaves, Syzigium\naromaticum leaves and flower, Ageratum conyzoides leaves, Cassia\nalata leaves, Cymbopogon nardus leaves, Curcuma domestica\nrhizome, Curcuma xanthorrhiza rhizome, Curcuma zedoaria\nrhizome, Alpinia galangae rhizome, Zingiber officinale rhizome,\nAcorus calamus rhizome, Allium sativum bulb, Cinnamomum cardamom cortex, Garcinia mangostana fruit cortex and Ecliptica alba\nherb. Extraction was performed by macerating 10 g of medicinal plant powder with 100 mL methanol for 48 hours, and the\nextract obtained was evaporated to dryness. The extract was\ntested at 0.5 and 1% in water containing 2% Tween-80.\nAgar diffusion method was employed to test the antifungal activity [1,2]. Phytophthora palmivora Butler was obtained from\nthe collection of Mycology Laboratory, Life Science Center of\nBandung Institute of Technology. Fusarium oxysporum culture\nwas obtained from Horticultural Research Institute Lembang,\nBandung. The cultures were inoculated on PDA and incubated at 25 \u00b0C\u201330 \u00b0C for seven days. The assay was performed\nby making four diffusion wells on solid PDA media using a cork borer, and into each well 50 ?l tested sample was added. Fungal\nculture with a diameter of 5 mm that was prepared using a\ncork borer was inoculated in the middle of the media and incubated for seven days. Inhibition diameter was measured after\nseven days and antifungal activity presented as inhibition percentage that was calculated by dividing the difference between\nthe diameter of mycelial control growth and test growth toward\nthe control growth.\nMethanol extract of C. alata leaves, C. xanthorrhiza,\nC. domestica, C. zedoaria and S. aromaticum gave more than 50%\ninhibition at 1% toward P. palmivora. Extract of S. aromaticum\nflower gave the highest inhibition at 89.5%. Growth inhibitions at higher than 50% toward the growth of F. oxysporum were\nonly given by the extract of P. betle leaf, S. aromaticum leaf and\nS. aromaticum flower.The highest antifusarium activity was also\ndemonstrated by S. aromaticum flower extract. Identification of\nthe antifungal compound toward both phytopathogenic fungi\nfrom S. aromaticum leaf and flower showed eugenol as the responsible compound for the antifungal activity.\nCell wall of fungi treated with eugenol was shrinking, indicating the disruption of cell wall structure (Fig. 1). Eugenol\ninduces the leakage of protein and lipid from the cells at 2\u00d7\nMIC for 120 minutes due to the damage of bacterial cell walls\n[3]. Latest finding showed that eugenol block the transport of\naromatic and branched chain amino acid across the cytoplasmic membrane [4].\nClove is potential to be developed as a source for natural\nantifungal agent to control crop infection by pathogenic fungi\nagents such as Phytophthora and Fusarium. It may also be developed as antifungal agent for human skin infection by fungi.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Nyoman P. Aryantha [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["S.
