{"Nomor": 35864, "Judul": "Algae toxicological assessment and valorization of energetic-laden wastewater streams using Scenedesmus obliquus", "Abstrak": "The manufacturing of energetic compounds (explosives), such as 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine\n(RDX) and 3-nitro-1,2,4-triasol-5-one (NTO), generates large volumes of wastewater containing\norganic pollutants, which are also rich in nutrients, mainly nitrogen. These wastewaters are subject to\nregulatory compliance and require treatment prior to their release into local water bodies. An approach is\nproposed to recover nutrients and water from wastewaters prior to treatment by growing microalgae\nwith the aim to reduce the energy footprint of the munitions production facility by producing algaebased biofuels. In order to assess the feasibility of implementation of the proposed approach, ten\ndifferent fully characterized untreated wastewaters with various levels of organic and inorganic carbon\nand nitrogen content were assessed for microalgae toxicity using Scenedesmus obliquus ATCC\u00ae 11477 as\ntarget microorganism. Toxicity experiments were performed in microplates for six days at 25 C, 120 rpm\norbital mixing speed, under a 14:10 h light: dark photoperiod, and 68 mmol photons/m2\ns of light intensity. The results indicate that the majority of the wastewater streams assessed could be used as\nnutrient media with no pretreatment while only three of the streams required chemical treatment due to\ntheir high growth inhibition characteristics. From the toxicological results obtained, a site specific\nmixture prepared by blending of the different untreated waste streams was tested for Scenedesmus\nobliquus growth. It was observed that this microalga can reach 5  107 cells/mL over six days of incubation in the wastewater mixture containing up to 24 mg/L RDX and 28 mg/L NTO. This strain exhibited\nsimilar growth patterns in the wastewater mixture as compared to the control sample, suggesting the\npotential feasibility of using untreated, energetic-laden industrial wastewater along with carbon dioxide\n[CO2 (atmospheric or flue gases)] for microalgae biomass production.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Juliana Abraham [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yanxia Lin.,Abhishek RoyChowdhury.,Christos Christodoulatos.,Matthew Conway.,Benjamin Smolinski .,Washington Braida"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Energetic-laden wastewater Microalgae Algae toxicity Valorization Sustainability Bioenergy", "Sumber": "Journal of Cleaner Production 202 (2018) 838-845", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Mar 2019"}
