{"Nomor": 33368, "Judul": "HETEROGENEOUS ACTIVATION, LOCAL STRUCTURE, AND SOFTNESS IN SUPERCOOLED COLLOIDAL LIQUIDS", "Abstrak": "We experimentally characterize heterogeneous nonexponential relaxation in bidisperse supercooled\ncolloidal liquids utilizing a recent concept called \u201csoftness\u201d [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 108001 (2015)]. Particle\ntrajectory and structure data enable classification of particles into subgroups with different local\nenvironments and propensities to hop. We determine residence times t R between particle hops and show that tR derived from particles in the same softness subgroup are exponentially distributed. Using the mean residence time  ?tR for each softness subgroup, and a Kramers\u2019 reaction rate model, we estimate the activation energy barriers E b for particle hops, and show that both ?tR and E b are monotonic functions of softness. Finally, we derive information about the combinations of large and small particle neighbors that determine particle softness, and we explicitly show that multiple exponential relaxation channels in the supercooled liquid give rise to its nonexponential behavior.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "XIAOGUANG MA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["ZOEY S.
