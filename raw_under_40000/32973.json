{"Nomor": 32973, "Judul": "Pad-Scale Control Improves SAGD Performance", "Abstrak": "Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) is widely used in the Athabasca oil sands deposit to recover\nbitumen. Since the viscosity of bitumen is high at original reservoir conditions, heat is required to lower\nits viscosity to the point it becomes mobile enough to be recovered under gravity drainage. To heat the\nreservoir, steam is injected into the formation and thus SAGD is energy intense. Given that the fuel used\nto generate steam is the largest operating cost, the steam-to-oil ratio is one of the key parameter for\nevaluating the economics of any SAGD project. Here, the use of dynamic distributed steam injection\nwithin a pad of SAGD wellpairs is explored. The results demonstrate that feedback control leads to\nimprovements of the SOR over that of constant pressure. The results show that the controller is able to\ndetect the \u201csweet spots\u201d (oil zones with better geological properties) in the reservoir and dynamically\ndeliver more steam to that region. Meanwhile, it reduces the steam injection towards relatively worse\nquality zones to lower the local SOR", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "TAO GUO [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jingyi Wang, Ian D.
