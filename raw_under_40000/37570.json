Suppose that\nthe material is elastically isotropic, ideally elastic-plastic and its elastic modulus and yield limit\nvary radially according to exponential functions. Closed-form solutions to the stresses and radial\ndisplacement in both purely elastic stress state and partially plastic stress state are presented.\nNumerical examples reveal the distinct characteristics of elastoplastic bending of a curved beam\ncomposed of inhomogeneous materials. Due to the inhomogeneity of materials, the bearing capacity\nof the curved beam can be improved greatly and the initial yield mode can also be dominated.\nClosed-form solutions presented here can serve as benchmark results for evaluating numerical\nsolutions.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Guojuan Nie [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zheng Zhong"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "elastoplastic pure bending, curved beam, inhomogeneous materials, closed-form solutions", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Apr 2019"}
