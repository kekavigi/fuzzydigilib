{"Nomor": 37333, "Judul": "Graph Divisible Designs and Packing Constructions", "Abstrak": "We introduce a generalization of group divisible designs and offer example\napplications to challenging problems in design theory. The generalization considers\nedge-decompositions of joins of arbitrary graphs, whereas group divisible designs\nhandle only joins of edgeless graphs. Our example constructions include: (1) optimal\npackings with block size five for the previously unsettled congruence class v ? 13\n(mod 20); (2) an optimal grooming with with ratio seven for the previously unsettled\ncongruence class v ? 56 (mod 84); and (3) a constructive \u2018quadratic\u2019 embedding of\npartial designs with block size four.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Peter J.
