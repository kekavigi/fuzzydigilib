{"Nomor": 36435, "Judul": "Bamboo as an Emerging Source of Raw Material for Household and Building Products", "Abstrak": "Bamboo is a category of fast-growing and widely distributed perennials\nhaving unique physical and mechanical properties. The mechanical\nproperties of bamboo are often higher (typically by two to three times)\nthan those of conventional timbers, and it has become a very important\nraw material for the household/ building industries. Bamboo has been\ncommercially used for the production of indoor and outdoor floors,\nfurniture, and structural timber for building. Some performance defects/\ndrawbacks of bamboo have been effectively remedied, due to the new\ntechnologies, such as bamboo scrimber, which facilitates the market\npenetration/ acceptance of bamboo-based household and building\nproducts.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hongyun Qiu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jianfeng Xu, Zhibin He, Ling Long, and Xiaopeng Yue"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Bamboo; Household products; Building products; Bamboo scrimber", "Sumber": "Qiu et al.
