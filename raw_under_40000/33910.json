{"Nomor": 33910, "Judul": "Environmentally Friendly Method To Prepare Thermo-Reversible, Self-Healable Biobased Elastomers by One-Step Melt Processing", "Abstrak": ": Thermo-reversible elastomers (TRE) can be\nrepeatedly processed and, thus, can reduce the dependence of\nthe petroleum for synthetic rubber. The preparation of TRE is\ngenerally carried out in solution, and it requires a long\nreaction time. These disadvantages limit the large scale\npreparation of TRE. In the present work, we chose the\nepoxidized natural rubber (ENR) as the matrix and designed a\nnew method to prepare thermo-reversible, self-healable ENR\nby a catalyzed ring-opening (RO) reaction of ENR followed\nby a Diels?Alder (DA) reaction through one-step melt\nblending for the first time. Furfurylamine (FA) was first grafted onto ENR (ENR?FA) by an RO reaction under the presence of\ncatalyzer, and then bismaleimide (BMI) was added to induce the cross-linking of ENR?FA via DA reaction, which can be easily\nrealized during melt blending. As the DA reaction is reversible at different temperatures, the mechanical properties of thermoreversible ENR (TRENR) could be tailored by the ratio of FA to BMI. The TRENR is recyclable twice by compression\nmolding, while retaining 90% of its mechanical properties after the first recycling. In addition, the as-prepared TRENR exhibits\nself-healing ability. The preparation of TRENR was carried out in a Haake rheomixer batch mixer with a short reaction time,\nand it requires no solvent and does not produce a stimulating smell. This new technique is promising in industry for rubber\nrecycling and large-scale preparation of TRE in an environmentally friendly method.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zhanbin Feng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jing Hu.,Bing Yu.,\u00a7 Hongchi Tian.,Hongli Zuo.,Nanying Ning.,Ming Tian.,and Liqun Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "thermo-reversible elastomers, Diels?Alder reaction, epoxidized natural rubber, one-step melt processing,rubber recycling", "Sumber": "ACS Applied Polymer Materials", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Jan 2019"}
