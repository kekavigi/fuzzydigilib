{"Nomor": 34254, "Judul": "The Chaotic Behavior Among The Oil Prices, Expectation Of Investors And Stock Returns: TAR-TR-GARCH Copula And TAR-TR-TGARCH Copula", "Abstrak": "This paper has two aims. The first one is to investigate the existence of chaotic structures in the oil prices, expectations of\ninvestors and stock returns by combining the Lyapunov exponent and Kolmogorov entropy, and the second one is to\nanalyze the dependence behavior of oil prices, expectations of investors and stock returns from January 02, 1990, to June\n06, 2017. Lyapunov exponents and Kolmogorov entropy determined that the oil price and the stock return series exhibited\nchaotic behavior. TAR-TR-GARCH and TAR-TR-TGARCH copula methods were applied to study the co-movement\namong the selected variables. The results showed significant evidence of nonlinear tail dependence between the volatility\nof the oil prices, the expectations of investors and the stock returns. Further, upper and lower tail dependence and comovement between the analyzed series could not be rejected. Moreover, the TAR-TR-GARCH and TAR-TR-TGARCH\ncopula methods revealed that the volatility of oil price had crucial effects on the stock returns and on the expectations of\ninvestors in the long run.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MELIKE BILDIRIC [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Oil price, Expectations of investors, Stock returns, Chaos Lyapunov exponent, Kolmogorov entropy, TAR-TR-GARCH and TAR-TR-TGARCH copula methods", "Sumber": "Petroleum Science (2019) 16:217\u2013228 https://doi.org/10.1007/s12182-018-0281-7", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Feb 2019"}
