{"Nomor": 33704, "Judul": "Fuzzy commitment scheme for generation of cryptographic keys based on iris biometrics", "Abstrak": "This work presents a method based on information-theoretic analysis of iris biometric that aims to extract\nhomogeneous regions of high entropy. Successful extraction of these regions facilitates the development of effective systems for generation of cryptographic keys of lengths up to 400 bits per iris. At the same time, this approach allows for the application of simpler error correction codes with equal false accept rate levels, which reduces the overall complexity of this class of systems.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Sasa Adamovic [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mladen Veinovi, Marko Sarac, Aleksandar Jevremovic, Milan Milosavljevic"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "cryptographic keys based on iris biometrics", "Sumber": "IET Biom., 2017, Vol. 6 Iss. 2, pp. 89-96, The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2016", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan \u00a0\n                                     Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Jan 2019"}
