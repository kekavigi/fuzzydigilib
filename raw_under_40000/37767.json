{"Nomor": 37767, "Judul": "Experimental Evaluation of Wave Transmission and Dynamics of Double-Row Floating Breakwaters", "Abstrak": "Floating breakwaters are recognized as effective wave-attenuation structures for protecting shorelines and marine facilities. However, most common single-row floating breakwaters are unable to effectively attenuate the waves that accompany adverse sea conditions. The double-row floating breakwater was evaluated in order to improve the wave-attenuation performance of floating breakwater technology in adverse seas. A series of scaled experiments in a two-dimensional wave flume was conducted to compare the effectiveness of single- and double-row floating breakwaters. The resulting wave transmission coefficients, reflection coefficients, motion responses, and mooring forces were measured to quantify the hydrodynamic performance of the breakwaters. The double-row floating breakwater exhibited superior wave-attenuation performance when compared with the single-row floating breakwater, especially when subjected to short-period, high-amplitude waves.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Chun-Yan Ji [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ren-Shi Zheng, Jie Cui, Zhi-Lei Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "Wave Transmission and Dynamics, Double-Row Floating Breakwaters", "Sumber": "Journal of Waterway, Port, Coastal, and Ocean Engineering / Volume 145 Issue 4 - July 2019", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Apr 2019"}
