{"Nomor": 34791, "Judul": "Real-time numerical shake prediction and updating for earthquake early warning", "Abstrak": "Ground motion prediction is important for earthquake early warning systems, because the region\u2019s peak ground motion indicates the potential disaster. In order to predict the peak ground motion quickly and precisely with limited station wave records, we propose a real-time numerical shake prediction and updating method. Our method first predicts the ground motion based on the ground motion prediction equation after P waves detection of several stations, denoted as the initial prediction. In order to correct the prediction error of the initial prediction, an updating scheme based on real-time simulation of wave propagation is designed. Data assimilation technique is incorporated to predict the distribution of seismic wave energy precisely. Radiative transfer theory and Monte Carlo simulation are used for modeling wave propagation in 2-D space, and the peak ground motion is calculated as quickly as possible. Our method has potential to predict shakemap, making the potential disaster be predicted before the real disaster happens. 2008 M S8.0 Wenchuan earthquake is studied as an example to show the validity of the proposed method.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP TIANYUN WANG 1": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/158666"}, "Penulis": "Tianyun Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xing Jin, Yongxiang Wei, Yandan Huang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Real-time numerical shake prediction,  2-D space model,  Radiative transfer theory,  Data assimilation,  Shakemap prediction", "Sumber": "Earthquake Science  December 2017, Volume 30, Issue 5\u20136, pp 251\u2013267 | Cite as", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Feb 2019"}
