{"Nomor": 36042, "Judul": "Petrophysical properties of deformation bands in high porous sandstones across fault zones in the Rio do Peixe Basin, Brazil", "Abstrak": "In this contribution we show the variation of the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) and petrophysical\nproperties of different architectural elements of fault zones affecting poorly lithified coarse sandstone and\nconglomerates of the Rio do Peixe basin, NE Brazil. We worked on three distinct outcrops; (1) non-deformed\n(protolith); (2) single fault zone, presenting moderate strain; and (3) complex fault zone, presenting a high strain\nintensity, where multiple and well developed fault cores occurs. To characterize the structural domains, we\nperformed scanlines and uniaxial geomechanical survey across deformation bands and clustering zones. We\ncombined geomechanical data with porosity data acquired thru image analysis and gas expansion analysis. We\nacquired data on deformation band cores and zones between deformation bands (i.e., deformed zones that do not\npresent deformation bands). Our results show that the complex fault zone exhibits a strong increase on the rock\nresistance, thus presenting UCS values three times higher than those obtained on the single fault zone outcrop\nand four times higher when compared with the non-deformed outcrop. It suggests that there is a direct relation\nbetween strain and rock resistance. The porosity is also strongly affected by the deformation, exhibiting an\ninverse relation with the strain intensity. Complex fault zone presents up to 75% of porosity reduction, while\nsingle fault zone, only about 10% of reduction. The petrophysical properties were calculated in the complex fault\nzone, where the resistance of the DBs was as high as twice that of the zone without bands, which had effects on\nthe Young\u2019s and the incompressibility\u2019s moduli. The results suggest that even though DBs generate up to a 40%\nincrease in the UCS and a 75% decrease in the porosity, the structural domains where the rock is located strongly\ncontrols the geomechanical and petrophysical properties, thus, directly affecting the anisotropy of a reservoir.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Cayo C.C.
