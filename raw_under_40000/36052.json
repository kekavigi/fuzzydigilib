{"Nomor": 36052, "Judul": "Antibacterial Povidone-Iodine-Conjugated Cross-Linked PolystyreneResin for Water Bacterial Decontamination", "Abstrak": "Bacterial contamination in water purification systems is generating significant concern as a global health issue. Inthis paper, we describe fabricating antibacterial povidone-iodine-conjugated cross-linked polystyrene resins (i.e., P(St-DVB-NVP)-I2) and investigating them as antimicrobial agents for water decontamination. Comprehensive antibacterial tests showedthat the addition of povidone-iodine to polystyrene resins resulted in strong antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria. Inaddition, the as-synthesized P(St-DVB-NVP)-I2was confirmed to have hydrophobicity and favorable biocompatibility. We thenexamined the possibility of using P(St-DVB-NVP)-I2as an antibacterialfilter for water treatment and found that it couldefficiently remove bacteria from water. An analog experiment demonstrated that the capability of P(St-DVB-NVP)-I2for waterbacterial decontamination was not influenced by the presence of mineral ions in the water. Most significantly, we confirmed thepotential reusability of P(St-DVB-NVP)-I2through a recycling test. This method of creating an antibacterial resin by building aconjugation of cross-linked polystyrene with povidone-iodine is safe, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly, and the resinshows promise for use in water purificationfilters.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Tianyi Gao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Qinggele Borjihan,Jiebing Yang,Huihui Qu,Wenxin Liu,Quanshun Li,Yan-Jie Wang,Alideertu Dong"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "povidone-iodine, polystyrene resin, antibacterial, biocompatibility, water bacterial decontamination", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
