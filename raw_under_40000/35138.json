{"Nomor": 35138, "Judul": "Carbone Dioxide Capture And Utilization In Gas Turbine Plants Via The Integration Of Power To Gas", "Abstrak": "Recent studies have shown that the concentration of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide in\nthe atmosphere is growing rapidly over recent years and this can lead to major dangers for the\nplanet. This growth is mainly due to the emissions from fossil power source such as diesel plants\nand gas turbines. The purpose of the present paper is to study the feasibility of integrating a\ntechnique based on power to gas concept in fossil power plants such as gas turbine. This work is\nbased on the reduction of pollutant gas emissions produced from a gas turbine plant, especially the\ncarbon dioxide. This captured gas (CO2) can be converted once again into energy via the technique\nof power to gas concept. This concept starts by extracting CO2 from exhaust gases which is carried\nout by multiple chemical process. On the other side, H2 is produced from water electrolysis using\nthe excess electricity which is produced but not consumed by the existing loads. finally the production of Methane (CH4) can be achieved by combination of the captured CO2 and the extracted H2\nvia a reactor known as a reactor of Sabatier, this operation is called methanation or hydrogenation\nof carbon dioxide. Simulation results are presented for the validation of the proposed technique\nbased on real data obtained on site from a gas turbine plant", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ahmed Boubenia [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ahmed Hafaifa", "Abdellah Kouzou", "Kamal Mohammedi", "Mohamed Becherif"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Gas turbine, Electrolyzer, Hydrogene, Carbone dioxide, Methanizer, Methane", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 3, Issue 1, Pages 127-137 (March 2017)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Feb 2019"}
