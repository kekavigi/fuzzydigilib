{"Nomor": 33126, "Judul": "Exploring the coastal urban resilience and transformation of coupled human-environment systems", "Abstrak": "Resilience thinking explores the sustainability discourse and transformation of urban complex systems.\nFrom the perspective of urban and human environment, this research simulated the resilience transformation of human-environment systems according to the modified catastrophe theory. The adaptive\ncycle model was performed an approach to interpret resilience transformations in the interactive\nhuman-environment systems. In this study, we quantified the resilience of human and environment subsystems through four models of catastrophe theory (Fold, Cusp, Swallowtail and Butterfly model). The\nresilience transformation was addressed through the mechanism of adaptive cycle that contained four\nphases within four different time periods (exploitation-r: 2000e2002; release phase-U: 2002e2003;\nconservation-K: 2004e2008 and exploitation-r: 2008e2010). Ultimately, we explored the key drivers of\nthe transformation in complex human-environmental systems, which included production, energy and\npollution. Moreover, understanding the transformations in terms of the human and environmental\ncomponents were indispensable in urban resilience management.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yi Li [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Martin Kappas.,Yangfan Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Urban transformation Resilience Catastrophe theory Adaptive cycle Human-environment systems Environment management", "Sumber": "Journal of Cleaner Production 195 (2018) 1505-1511", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi \u00a0\n                                     Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Jan 2019"}
