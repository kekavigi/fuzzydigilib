{"Nomor": 37191, "Judul": "Origin of Magic Angles in Twisted Bilayer Graphene", "Abstrak": "Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) was recently shown to host superconductivity when tuned to special\n\u201cmagic angles\u201d at which isolated and relatively flat bands appear. However, until now the origin of the\nmagic angles and their irregular pattern have remained a mystery. Here we report on a fundamental\ncontinuum model for TBG which features not just the vanishing of the Fermi velocity, but also the perfect\nflattening of the entire lowest band. When parametrized in terms of ? ? 1=?, the magic angles recur with a\nremarkable periodicity of ?? ? 3=2.We show analytically that the exactly flat band wave functions can be\nconstructed from the doubly periodic functions composed of ratios of theta functions\u2014reminiscent of\nquantum Hall wave functions on the torus. We further report on the unusual robustness of the\nexperimentally relevant first magic angle, address its properties analytically, and discuss how lattice\nrelaxation effects help justify our model parameters.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Grigory Tarnopolsky [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Alex Jura Kruchkov,", "and Ashvin Vishwanath"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "--", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 122, 106405 (2019); \u00a9 2019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Mar 2019"}
