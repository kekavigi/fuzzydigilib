{"Nomor": 33530, "Judul": "Multi-frame super-resolution for long range captured iris polar image", "Abstrak": "In this study, a framework is proposed to super-resolve the long range captured iris polar images. In this study, modified diamond search and enhanced total variation algorithms are proposed to super-resolve the long range captured iris polar multi-frame images. The framework is tested on Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Automation (CASIA) long range iris database by comparing and analysing the structural similarity index matrix, peak signal-to-noise ratio, visual information fidelity in pixel domain, and execution time of proposed algorithms with Yang and Nguyen state-of-the-art algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework is well suited for super-resolution of iris images captured at a long distance.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Anand Deshpande [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prashant Patavardhan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Multi-frame super-resolution", "Sumber": "IET Biom., 2017, Vol. 6 Iss. 2, pp. 108-116, The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2016", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan \u00a0\n                                     Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Jan 2019"}
