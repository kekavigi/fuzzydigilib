{"Nomor": 32387, "Judul": "Distributed Finite-Time Multi-Agent Control for DC Microgrids with Time Delays", "Abstrak": "This paper proposes a novel distributed multi-agent ?nite-time control strategy with time delays for the state of charge balancing and voltage restoration in a DC microgrid with distributed battery energy storage systems. The delays can be different and theoretically unbounded for each battery system. Feedback linearisation method is applied to convert the state of charge balancing and voltage restoration problems to doubleintegrator and single-integrator systems with input time delays, respectively. Then, the Artstein transformation is applied to reduce the time delayed systems to delay-free systems. Based on the reduced models, the ?nite-time control is modi?ed to achieve the state of charge balancing and voltage restoration. Only the state of charge and its derivative and voltage information are required to be transmitted over a sparse communication network to generate the control signals. The ?nite-time Lyapunov method ensures accurate convergence and ?nite-time stability. The proposed secondary control strategy can be integrated with conventional primary droop control. The proposed control strategy is resilient to communication link failures and features plug-and-play capability. The performance is veri?ed with an RTDS Technologies real-time digital simulator, using switching converter models and nonlinear lead-acid battery models.
