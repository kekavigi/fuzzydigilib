{"Nomor": 37631, "Judul": "Autonomous Molecular Design: Then and Now", "Abstrak": "The success of deep machine learning inprocessing of large amounts of data, for example, in imageor voice recognition and generation, raises the possibilitiesthat these tools can also be applied for solving complexproblems in materials science. In this forum article, we focuson molecular design that aims to answer the question on howwe can predict and synthesize molecules with tailored physical, chemical, or biological properties. A potential answer to thisquestion could be found by using intelligent systems that integrate physical models and computational machine learningtechniques with automated synthesis and characterization tools. Such systems learn through every single experiment in ananalogy to a human scientific expert. While the general idea of an autonomous system for molecular synthesis andcharacterization has been around for a while, its implementations for the materials sciences are sparse. Here we provide anoverview of the developments in chemistry automation and the applications of machine learning techniques in the chemical andpharmaceutical industries with a focus on the novel capabilities that deep learning brings in", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Tanja_Dimitrov_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/165120"}, "Penulis": "Tanja Dimitrov, [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Christoph Kreisbeck,Jill S.
