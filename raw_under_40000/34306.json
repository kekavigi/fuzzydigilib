{"Nomor": 34306, "Judul": "EXPERIMENTAL RECONSTRUCTION OF ENTANGLEMENT QUASIPROBABILITIES", "Abstrak": "We report on the first experimental reconstruction of an entanglement quasiprobability. In contrast to\nrelated techniques, the negativities in our distributions are a necessary and sufficient identifier of\nseparability and entanglement and enable a full characterization of the quantum state. A reconstruction\nalgorithm is developed, a polarization Bell state is prepared, and its entanglement is certified based on the\nreconstructed entanglement quasiprobabilities, with a high significance and without correcting for\nimperfections.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "J.
