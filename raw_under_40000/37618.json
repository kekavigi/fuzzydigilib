{"Nomor": 37618, "Judul": "Neural adaptive congestion control for broadband ATM networks", "Abstrak": "The paper investigates the application\nof neural networks to adaptive congestion control\nin broadband ATM networks. A neural control\nscheme is proposed which is a direct application\nof the backpropagation neural networks with\nthose modifications required to pose the problem\nin the framework of a general quality-of-service\ncontrol. The learning algorithms regulating traffic\nloads to meet performance requirements are\ndescribed and validated. To illustrate the present\nscheme\u2019s ability to control, three examples of networks\nconsisting of simple dynamic queuing\nmodels are studied through simulations", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xiaoqiang Chen [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["I.M.
