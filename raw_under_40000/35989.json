{"Nomor": 35989, "Judul": "Antibiotic-Derived Lipid Nanoparticles to Treat IntracellularStaphylococcusaureus", "Abstrak": "Intracellular survival of pathogenic bacteria leads to high chances ofbacterial persistence and relapse in the bacteria-infected host. However, manyantibiotics fail to clear the intracellular bacteria due to their low internalization bycells. In order to increase delivery of antibiotics in cells and eliminate intracellularbacteria, we developed antibiotic-derived lipid nanoparticles. First, we synthesizedantibiotic-derived lipid conjugates using two widely used antibiotics includingpenicillin G (PenG) and levofloxacin (Levo). Then, we formulated them intoantibiotic-derived lipid nanoparticles and evaluated their antibacterial effects. Wefound that PenG-derived phospholipid nanoparticles (PenG-PL NPs) were able toenhance cellular uptake of penicillin G as compared with free penicillin G andeliminate up to 99.9998% of?108.5intracellular methicillin-sensitiveStaphylococcusaureus(S. aureus) in infected A549 cells, a lung epithelial cell line. The PenG-PL NPsshowed the potential for inhibiting intracellularS. aureusand are promising to befurther studied for in vivo antibacterial applications", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Chengxiang_Zhang_11.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/161382"}, "Penulis": "Chengxiang Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Weiyu Zhao,Cong Bian,Xucheng Hou,Binbin Deng,David W.
