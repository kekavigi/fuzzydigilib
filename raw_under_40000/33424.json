{"Nomor": 33424, "Judul": "Microplastic Lens Array Fabricated by a Hot Intrusion Process", "Abstrak": "A microplastic lens array has been successfully constructed on top of a 500- m-thick PC (Polycarbonate film) by\nusing a micro hot intrusion process. A single-layer LIGA process\nis used to fabricate the high-aspect-ratio nickel mold insert that\nhas circular hole patterns of 80 m in diameter and 200 m in\ndepth. Under the hot intrusion process, plastic material can be\nintruded into these circular-shape holes and stopped at desired\ndepth under elevated temperature and pressure to fabricate\nmicrolenses. By adjusting the embossing load, temperature and\ntime, the curvature and height of the lens are controllable when\nthe same mold insert is used. The optical properties of these\nmicrolenses have been characterized and the average radius\nof curvature is found as 41.4 m with a standard deviation of\n1.05 m. Experimental characterization and theoretical model are\nconducted and developed for the micro-intrusion process in terms\nof the radius of curvature and height of the lenses and they correspond well with experimental data within 5% of variations. The\nfocusing capability of the lenses is demonstrated by comparing\nthe images of laser light with and without using the lenses. When\nthe projection screen is placed 200 m away from the lens, the\nfull-width at half-maximum (FWHM) for the lens is 110 m while\nthe original FWHM of the optical fiber is 300 m.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Li-Wei Pan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xinjiang Shen., Liwei Lin"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Contactless, microintrustion, microlens, lens.", "Sumber": "JOURNAL OF MICROELECTROMECHANICAL SYSTEMS, VOL. 13, NO. 6, DECEMBER 2004", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Jan 2019"}
