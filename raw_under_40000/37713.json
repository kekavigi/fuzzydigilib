{"Nomor": 37713, "Judul": "Voice activity detection using a periodicity measure", "Abstrak": "The paper describes a voice activity\ndetector (V AD) that can operate reliably in SNRs\ndown to 0 dB and detect most speech at - 5 dB.\nThe detector applies a least-squares periodicity\nestimator to the input signal, and triggers when a\nsignificant amount of periodicity is found. It does\nnot aim to find the exact talkspurt boundaries\nand, consequently, is most suited to speechlogging\napplications where it is easy to include a\nsmall margin to allow for any missed speech. The\npaper discusses the problem of false triggering on\nnonspeech periodic signals and shows how robustness\nto these signals can be achieved with suitable\npreprocessing and postprocessing.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "R.
