Water and food security. Urban air pollution. These\nenvironmental grand challenges are all linked, yet each is studied separately.\nInteractions between Earth\u2019s surface and the atmosphere influence climate, air quality\nand water cycles. Changes in one affect the others. For example, increasing carbon dioxide enhances photosynthesis. As they grow, plants withdraw greenhouse gases from the\natmosphere, but they also release volatile organic compounds such as monoterpenes.\nThese speed up the formation of aerosol particles, which reflect sunlight back into space.\nOur actions \u2014 such as emission-control policies, urbanization and forestry \u2014 also\naffect the atmosphere, land and seas1\u20135.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MARKKU KULMALA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Astronomi", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Astronomy", "Sumber": "4 JANUARY 2018 | VOL 553 | NATURE | 21", "Staf Input/Edit": "pustaka bosscha", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Jan 2019"}
