{"Nomor": 36360, "Judul": "Symbolic, Aesthetic and Generative Applications", "Abstrak": "In a chapter in our recent edited book, Kim Williams and I set out to classify the\ndifferent types of relationships between architecture and mathematics that we have\nobserved in the almost 20 year history of the Nexus conference series and the Nexus\nNetwork Journal. As part of this process we identified three overarching categories\nthat capture the majority of the ways mathematics is used in the service of\narchitecture (Ostwald and Williams 2015). The first of these categories is\n\u2018\u2018mathematics for architecture\u2019\u2019, being practical or functional tools or techniques\nfor the support of architectural design, construction and conservation. The second is\n\u2018\u2018mathematics in architecture\u2019\u2019, encompassing geometric or numeric properties that\nare demonstrated or visible in a design. The final category is the \u2018\u2018mathematics of\narchitecture\u2019\u2019, which includes logical and analytical methods for quantifying various\nproperties of space and form. Within these three overarching categories, there are 12\nsubsets or application types. For example, one of these application types is\n\u2018\u2018measurement\u2019\u2019, which is defined as \u2018\u2018the use of mathematics to record and\ncommunicate dimensional information\u2019\u2019 (Ostwald and Williams 2015, p. 46).\nAnother application is, \u2018\u2018inspiration\u2019\u2019, the use of mathematics as \u2018\u2018an influence,\nmotivation or means of animation\u2019\u2019 (Ostwald and Williams 2015, p. 46). While not\nnecessarily exhaustive, this multi-level, multi-factor system was developed to\nsupport scholars to clarify their own thinking when they are interrogating particular\nconnections between architecture and mathematics.\nThe research featured in vol. 17, no 2 of the Nexus Network Journal:\nArchitecture and Mathematics, covers at least six of the 12 application types,\nalthough the vast majority of the papers are concerned with just three of these. The\nmost common application types found in this issue are \u2018\u2018symbolic\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018aesthetic\u2019\u2019.\nThe first of these involves the use of mathematics to represent or communicate\nsomething about a building. The second covers applications of mathematics to\nachieve a particular appearance or visual effect. More than half of the papers in this\nissue examine the ways architects have used geometry for symbolic of aesthetic\npurposes. The third most common application type in this issue is \u2018\u2018generation\u2019\u2019,\nbeing the use of rules or algorithms to evolve or parameterise aspects of a design.\nWhile other themes are present in the papers that make up vol. 17, no 2, symbolic,\naesthetic and generative applications dominate the issue.\nIn the first paper in this issue, Antonio Ce\u00b4sar Gonza\u00b4lez-Garc?\u00b4a and Juan Antonio\nBelmonte, examine the orientation of Pre-Romanesque Churches in the Iberian\nPeninsula. Using a statistical analysis of 167 churches that were built prior to 1086\nAD, Gonza\u00b4lez-Garc?\u00b4a\u2019s and Belmonte\u2019s results confirm the anticipated pattern\nwherein the orientation of the apse reflects the equinox, but within this larger trend,\nvarious unexpected patterns emerge. The second paper in this issue, by Patricia\nBen?\u00b4tez Herna\u00b4ndez and Mercedes Valiente Lo\u00b4pez, is about the geometrical\nproperties of Late Gothic helical stairs. In the late fifteenth century the geometry\nof the spiral staircase had to serve both practical (structural) and aesthetic\n(proportional) purposes. Ben?\u00b4tez Herna\u00b4ndez and Valiente Lo\u00b4pez identify two types\nof geometric constructions for these stairs\u2014the \u2018\u2018radial solution\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018tangent\nsolution\u2019\u2019\u2014and compare their applications and outcomes. The geometric constructions\nfound within sixteenth-century fortifications are the subject of the next paper,\nby Silvia Bertacchi and Sandro Parrinello. Italian military engineer Giovanni\nBattista Antonelli wrote an important treatise on this topic, the Epitomi delle\nfortificationi moderne, in the mid sixteenth century. In their research, Bertacchi and\nParrinello investigate Antonelli\u2019s treatise, focussing on geometrical properties, both\nproportional and defensive. The geometry of Baroque oval-plan churches is the\ntopic of the fourth paper in this issue. In this research Sylvie Duvernoy examines a\nseries of oval plan, late Cinquecento, churches and domes, noting that while the oval\ngeometry seemingly accommodated both symbolic and pragmatic requirements at\nthe time, it also posed a challenge for architects to resolve. The following paper, by\nLiz Dewitte, is about proportional systems in the architecture of Benedictine monk\nDom Paul Bellot. Dewitte\u2019s paper undertakes a close review of the geometrical\nproperties of the Augustinian College in Eindhoven, built by Dom Bellot between\n1922 and 1925. Through this review Dewitte uncovers a recurring geometric system\nthat has been used to sub-divide and order different parts of the building to achieve a\nharmonious composition. The next paper, by Marco Giorgio Bevilacqua, examines\nthe helical structures and planning used by architect Vittorio Bonade` Bottino. While\nbest known for his Lingotto factory in Turin, in the 1930s Bonade` Bottino also\nproduced helical towers in Sestrie`re, Marina di Massa and Sauze d\u2019Oulx.\nBevilacqua investigates three of these designs, not only in terms of their planning\nand structure, but also their symbolic properties.\nThe next two papers are about proportions, geometry and representation. In the\nfirst, Vitor Murtinho offers a new interpretation of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s illustration\nof Vitruvian Man. Several established explanations for Leonardo\u2019s famous\ngeometric tracery on the human body are derived from golden ratio constructions.\nHowever, in this paper Murtinho notes the geometric inconsistencies which are\nimplicit in these arguments and suggests an alternative construction for Vitruvian\nMan. In contrast, Ufuk Soyo\u00a8z\u2019s research is concerned with the way in which\ngeometric corrections or distortions of form have been employed to achieve\ndifferent optical outcomes. The paper argues that rather than being used to clarify\nthe perception of architectural form, optical correction techniques were often used\nto achieve complex spatial illusions.\nThe next two papers in the issue shift the focus to the use of mathematics and\nscience as a means of systematising knowledge and in doing so, understand various\naspects of architecture, perception and culture. In particular, in the first of these,\nMichela Rossi and Giorgio Buratti examine the geometric systems used to classify\nor understand colour. Throughout history, various geometric models have been\nemployed to represent and explain the differences between colours. By tracing the\nhistory of these models, Rossi and Buratti identify the role played by geometry as an\nordering system with both practical and symbolic properties, before considering a\nnew parametric model of colour classification. In the next paper Maria Zack\nexamines the reconstruction of two cities and the mathematical and scientific\nmodels and methods\u2014once again, both practical and symbolic\u2014which separately\nunderpinned the rebuilding efforts. The two cities are London, which was decimated\nby fire in 1666, and Lisbon, which was extensively damaged by an earthquake in\n1755.\nThe final three papers in the research section of the issue look at specific\ndimensional and geometric theories and techniques. Snezana Lawrence\u2019s paper,\n\u2018\u2018Life, Architecture, Mathematics and the Fourth Dimension\u2019\u2019 traces the history of\narchitectural interest in the fourth dimension, examining the social, ethical and\ntheological forces which inspired architects to look beyond conventional two and\nthree-dimensional forms. Cylindrical mirror anamorphosis is the topic of the paper\nfrom Marijana Paunovic and Aleksandar C ? uc?akovic\u00b4. Anamorphosis is the conceptualisation\nand realisation of an image that can only be viewed in its correct\nproportions, from a specific location. Mirror anamorphosis involves the use of\noptical geometry (projections and reflections) to realise the construction of such an\nimage. The next paper, by Mauro Chiarella and Rodrigo Garc?\u00b4a Alvarado, examines\nthe spatial and material properties of folds. Using a combination of constructed and\nunbuilt examples, from architectural practices, academics and students, this paper\ndescribes the parametric modelling, digital fabrication and assembly of folded\ncompositions.\nThe Didactics section of the journal is for papers that have an overt educational\nagenda or focus and the Geometer\u2019s Angle section is dedicated to explorations and\nexplanations of geometric constructions. The Didactics section of this issue includes\ntwo papers, both from Authors at the Middle East Technical University (METU) in\nAnkara (Turkey). The paper by Arzu Go\u00a8nenc\u00b8 Sorguc\u00b8, demonstrates an application\nof computational design in studio education. Using rule-based and parametric\nmodels, the paper explores several design and visualisation studies involving the\nmapping of movement. The following paper, by Firat O\u00a8 zgenel and Arzu Go\u00a8nenc\u00b8\nSorguc\u00b8, describes a new way of modelling complex reflected rays in three-\ndimensional space. In the Geometer\u2019s Angle, Javier Barrallo, Francisco Gonza\u00b4lez-\nQuintial and Santiago Sa\u00b4nchez-Beitia provide an introduction to the history and\ngeometric properties of the Vesica Piscis and the Reuleaux Triangle. Their paper\nconcludes with a series of examples of applications of related geometric structures\nin architecture.\nThere are two book reviews in this issue, the first of which is Elena Marchetti\u2019s\nreview of Viewpoints: Mathematical Perspective and Fractal Geometry in Art by\nMarc Frantz and Annalisa Crannel. The second is Sylvie Duvernoy\u2019s review of\nRachel Fletcher\u2019s Infinite Measure: Learning to Design in Geometric Harmony with\nArt, Architecture and Nature. Fletcher\u2019s research will be well known to readers of\nthe Nexus Network Journal, through her longstanding involvement in the\nGeometer\u2019s Angle.\nFinally, several of the papers in this issue were originally presented at the Nexus,\nArchitecture and Mathematics Conference in Ankara, Turkey, in 2014. These\npapers not only went through a rigorous double-blind-refereeing process prior to\nacceptance and presentation, but they also benefited from discussions that occurred\nduring the conference, and from a second round of reviews after the event. The\nremainder of the papers came through the conventional journal process, doubleblind\nrefereeing by experts.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Michael J.
