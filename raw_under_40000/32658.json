{"Nomor": 32658, "Judul": "Effective Learning Design of Game-Based 3D Virtual Language Learning Environments for Special Education Students Yu-Ju", "Abstrak": "This current study aimed at creating a 3D virtual environment on Second Life particularly for special\neducation students to enhance their first language, Mandarin, learning in vocabulary and sentence\nstructures. Four students aged between 8 and 9 participated in this research. In addition to their inherent\ndisabilities (mild autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or mild mental\nretardation), all the four participants suffer from delayed language development. The purpose of the 3-\nmonth study was therefore to establish a platform enhancing their learning of Mandarin Chinese. A designbased\nqualitative design was adopted in this study. The collected data included in-class observation, video\nclips of learning process, and post-study interviews with the four disabled children. Additionally, parents\u2019\ncomments on their children\u2019s oral expression skills at home were also collected. Through a two-cycle\ninvestigation, this research proposed six categories of Human-computer interface (HCI) design principles\nfor using virtual worlds to enhance special education students\u2019 Mandarin learning. In addition, both the\ninterview results and the parents\u2019 comments confirmed the effects of using this platform for special\neducation students\u2019 learning.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yu-Ju Lan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Indy Y.T.
