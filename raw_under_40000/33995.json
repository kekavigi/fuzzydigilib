{"Nomor": 33995, "Judul": "Dynamics of Residential Water-Soluble Organic Gases: Insights into Sources and Sinks", "Abstrak": "Water-soluble organic gas (WSOG) concentrations\nare elevated in homes. However, WSOG sources, sinks, and\nconcentration dynamics are poorly understood. We observed\nsubstantial variations in 23 residential indoor WSOG concentrations\nmeasured in real time in a North Carolina, U.S., home over several\ndays with a high-resolution time-of-flight chemical ionization mass\nspectrometer equipped with iodide reagent ion chemistry (I-HRToF-CIMS). Concentrations of acetic, formic, and lactic acids\nranged from 30?130, 15?53, and 2.5?360 ?g m?3\n, respectively.\nConcentrations of several WSOGs, including acetic and formic\nacids, decreased considerably (?30?50%) when the air conditioner\n(AC) cycled on, suggesting that the AC system is an important sink\nfor indoor WSOGs. In contrast to nonpolar organic gases, indoor\nWSOG loss rate coefficients were substantial for compounds with\nhigh oxygen-to-carbon (O/C) ratios (e.g., 1.6?2.2 h?1 for compounds with O/C > 0.75 when the AC system was off). Loss rate\ncoefficients in the AC system were more uncertain but were estimated to be 1.5 h?1\n. Elevated concentrations of lactic acid\ncoincided with increased human occupancy and cooking. We report several WSOGs emitted from cooking and cleaning as well\nas transported in from outdoors. In addition to indoor air chemistry, these results have implications to exposure and human health.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Sara M.
