{"Nomor": 38351, "Judul": "Subcultures and Use of Communication Information Technology in Higher Education Institutions", "Abstrak": "This study investigated the use of a computer-mediated communication information system by organizational members in a higher education institution with mixed methods. It compares the differences of liberal arts academic units, professional academic units, and administrative units in the university in their technology use. Specifically, it found that university subcultures influence organizational members' perceptions of utility values of a technology and norms about technology use, and their use of technology. Professional academic units scored highest in reported use and perception of the technology. The findings suggest that task interdependence and organizational support contribute to technology use.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Canchu Lin  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Louisa Ha"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Communication media, communication theory, cultural anthropology, educations", "Sumber": "The Journal of Higher Education. 80(5):564-590", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Mei 2019"}
