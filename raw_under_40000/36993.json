{"Nomor": 36993, "Judul": "The vernacular architecture of Doha, Qatar", "Abstrak": "The urban history of the Gulf states has been largely neglected, with historical studies\nof Qatar focusing on its political and economic development. This article presents an overview of the\nvernacular architecture of Doha that incorporates non-elite buildings. The life histories of these buildings\ntell the story of Qatar's rapid development in the 20th century and the dramatic changes to the society\nand urban fabric of its capital. Rapid development threatens to destroy this aspect of Qatar's past, and\nwe accordingly aim to record the diversity of the historic built environment of Doha.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "DANIEL EDDISFORD [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["ROBERT CARTER"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Vernacular architecture ; Doha ; Qatar", "Sumber": "Society for Post-Medieval Archaeology 2017 ;  Post-Medieval Archaeology 51/1 (2017), 81\u2013107", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Mar 2019"}
