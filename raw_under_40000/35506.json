{"Nomor": 35506, "Judul": "PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION AND SHEAR FORCES INSIDE THE PROTON", "Abstrak": "The distributions of pressure and shear forces inside the proton are investigated using lattice quantum\nchromodynamics (LQCD) calculations of the energy momentum tensor, allowing the first modelindependent\ndetermination of these fundamental aspects of proton structure. This is achieved by combining\nrecent LQCD results for the gluon contributions to the energy momentum tensor with earlier calculations of\nthe quark contributions. The utility of LQCD calculations in exploring, and supplementing, the\nassumptions in a recent extraction of the pressure distribution in the proton from deeply virtual Compton\nscattering is also discussed. Based on this study, the target kinematics for experiments aiming to determine\nthe pressure and shear distributions with greater precision at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator\nFacility and a future electron ion collider are investigated.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "P.
