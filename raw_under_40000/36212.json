The used equipment RMT-C includes a five-channel recorder\n(frequency range 1\u20131000 kHz), two electric and three magnetic sensors, and a transmitter (1 kW) with a\nhorizontal electric dipole as a source. The electric field measurements are carried out with ungrounded lines\nthus enabling surveys in the wintertime on snow and ice, and in the summertime in conditions adverse to the\ngroundings. The use of electric dipole as a source ensures operating in a wide frequency range at a significant\ndistance (up to 3\u20134 km) from the source. Measurements of basic signals and their odd sub harmonics raise the\nefficiency of the field surveys. For the covering of the full frequency range 1\u20131000 kHz, three basic frequencies\nare usually transmitted; each one is accompanied by 8\u201312 sub harmonics. This provides a high rate of measurements, i.e. about 70 sounding stations per day - 10 times faster than by the vertical electric sounding (VES) method. The CSRMT method offers the possibility to work in the far-field zone of the controlled source where the plane\nwave approximation of the primary field can be used. For the analysis of the high-frequency field of the electric\ndipole, an approach is used considering quasi-stationary and wave zones of the source. Features of the electromagnetic field are analyzed by taking into account displacement currents in the air. In the wave zone, at a certain\ndistance from the source (tens to hundreds of meters), field components are characterized by a number of\ndifferences compared to a quasi-stationary zone (slower drop of the field's amplitudes, change of the directional\ndiagram of the source, appearance of the ellipticity of polarization of electric and magnetic fields). The CSRMT\nmethod is intended for the application in remote regions where surveys by the standard RMT method could\nonly use Very Low Frequency (VLF) radio transmitter signals. Examples for the application of the CSRMT method\nare presented from the Arkhangelsk region (geophysical support of an onshore gas pipeline construction),\nand the Chukotka Peninsula (survey at a site of the ore-dressing factory construction). The CSRMT results were\nconfirmed by the subsequent drilling", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Alexander Saraev [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Alexander Simakov, Arseny Shlykov, B\u00fclent Tezkan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Radiomagnetotelluric sounding Controlled source Horizontal electric dipole High frequency Wave zone", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 146 (2017) 228\u2013237, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.09.017", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Mar 2019"}
