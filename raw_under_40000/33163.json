{"Nomor": 33163, "Judul": "Directional tilt derivatives to enhance structural trends in aeromagnetic grids", "Abstrak": "The tilt derivative remains one of the most simple and useful image enhancement methods that can be applied to\ngridded potential field data. Since it acts as a type of automatic gain control it is particularly useful for revealing\nlow-amplitude short-wavelength features in data. This derivative has now beenmodified to improve its ability to\nenhance linear trends with specific spatial orientations.When calculated for a range of directions it may be possible\nto detect subtle lineations that are not so evident in the original non-directional version of the tilt derivative.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ian C.F.
