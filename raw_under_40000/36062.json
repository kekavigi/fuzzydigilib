{"Nomor": 36062, "Judul": "High thermoelectric figure of merit and thermopower in layered perovskite oxides", "Abstrak": "We predict high thermoelectric efficiency in the layered perovskite La2Ti2O7, based on calculations (mostly ab initio) of the electronic structure, transport coefficients, and thermal conductivity in a wide temperature range. The figure of merit ZT computed with a temperature-dependent relaxation time increases monotonically from just above 1 at room temperature to over 2.5 at 1200 K, at an optimal carrier density of around 1020 cm?3. The Seebeck thermopower coefficient is between 200 and 300 ?V/K at optimal doping, but can reach nearly 1 mV/K at low doping. Much of the potential of this material is due to its lattice thermal conductivity of order 1W/(K m); using a model based on ab initio anharmonic calculations, we interpret this low value as due to effective phonon confinement within the layered-structure blocks.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Vincenzo Fiorentini [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Roberta Farris,", "Edoardo Argiolas,", "and Maria Barbara Maccioni"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS 3, 022401(R) (2019); \u00a92019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Mar 2019"}
