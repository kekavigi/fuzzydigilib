Results indicate that the variations in the amount and frequency of HP at the seven levels over the entire CEC all display a bimodal feature. For various regions, the variations of total HP mostly feature two peaks, while convective HP mainly occurs in the late afternoon and determines the diurnal variation of total HP intensity. On the basis of the primary peak time periods of HP frequency at all levels over di?erent subregions, the variations can be classi?ed into three main categories: late-afternoon primary peak, nocturnal primary peak, and time-shifting primary peak. However, the variations over some coastal regions like the Liaodong Peninsula, the Shandong Peninsula, and the coastal regions of Guangdong, distinctly di?er from those over their corresponding larger regions. Overall, the normalized diurnal variation amplitude of amount and frequency increases with the increasing HP intensity; convective precipitation can be represented by HP 10 mm; and the intensity of HP 50 mm is slightly larger during the nighttime than during the daytime over the entire CEC. In northern China, diurnal variation in HP 5 mm can represent well that in convective precipitation.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "YOUNGGUAN ZHENG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "Diurnalvariationsinamount,frequencyandintensityofwarm-seasonhourlyprecipitation(HP)atsevenlevels,whichare de?nedasHP0.1,0.5,1,5,10,20and50mm,arerevealedbasedonnolessthan30yearsofhourlyrain-gaugeobservations atnationalstationsovercentralandeasternChina(CEC).Thisstudyinvestigatesthevariations,relationships,di?erencesand similarities of total, stratiform, convective and extreme HP over the entire CEC and various subregions.
