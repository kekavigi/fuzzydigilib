{"Nomor": 36163, "Judul": "Numerical Investigation Of CO2 Storage In Hydrocarbon Field Using A Geomechanical-Fluid Coupling Model", "Abstrak": "Increasing pore pressure due to CO2 injection can lead to stress and strain changes of the reservoir.\nOne of the safely standards for long term CO2 storage is whether stress and strain changes caused\nby CO2 injection will lead to irreversible mechanical damages of the reservoir and impact the\nintegrity of caprock which could lead to CO2 leakage through previously sealing structures. Leakage\nfrom storage will compromise both the storage capacity and the perceived security of the project,\ntherefore, a successful CO2 storage project requires large volumes of CO2 to be injected into storage\nsite in a reliable and secure manner. Yougou hydrocarbon field located in Orods basin was chosen as\nstorage site based on it's stable geological structure and low leakage risks. In this paper, we present\na fluid pressure and stress-strain variations analysis for CO2 geological storage based on a\ngeomechanical-fluid coupling model. Using nonlinear elasticity theory to describe the geomechanical part of the model, while using the Darcy's law to describe the fluid flow. Two parts are\ncoupled together using the poroelasticity theory. The objectives of our work were: 1) evaluation of\nthe geomechanical response of the reservoir to different CO2 injection scenarios. 2) assessment of\nthe potential leakage risk of the reservoir caused by CO2 injection.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "GUANG LI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "CO2 geological storage, Depleted oil field, Numerical modeling, Geomechanics, Geomechanical-fluid coupling model", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 3, Pages 252-257 (September  2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Mar 2019"}
