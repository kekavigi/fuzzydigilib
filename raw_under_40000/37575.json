Based on Timoshenko-\nMindlin hypothesis and von Karman nonlinear theory, a set of nonlinear governing equations of\nmotion for FG shallow spherical shells in regard to transverse shear deformation and all the inertia\nterms are established using Hamilton\u2019s principle. The collocation point method and Newmark-\nbeta scheme in conjunction with the finite difference method are adopted to solve the governing\nequations of motion and the unsteady heat conduction equation numerically. In the numerical\nexamples, the transient deflection and stresses of FG shallow spherical shells with various material\nproperties under different loading conditions are presented.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Y iming Fu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sumin Hu, Yiqi Mao"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "functionally graded materials, unsteady temperature field, transient deflection and stresses", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Apr 2019"}
