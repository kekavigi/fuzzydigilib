{"Nomor": 32947, "Judul": "Fenton Treatment Via Oxidative Mechanism And Its Kinetics On Soil Polluted With Automatic Gas Oil", "Abstrak": "The effectiveness, viability and feasibility of applying Fenton reactants in treating soil contaminated with\nautomatic gas oil (AGO) was investigated ex-situ. Soil was simulated to achieve 10% contamination using\nAGO (diesel) as the primary contaminant. Physicochemical properties and heavy metal contents were\ncharacterized using standard analytical methods, while total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) content was\ndetermined by molecular spectroscopy. An investigation of the soil physicochemical properties shows\nsevere impact of the contaminant on pH, conductivity, phosphorus and (TPH) content. The optimum\nconcentration of Fenton reactants determined from the optimization study was found to be 350,000 ppm\nH2O2 and 600 ppm FeSO4 at optimum room temperature range of 27e30 C and optimum pH of 4.7. The\nhighly exothermic Fenton oxidation treatment resulted in significant decrease in TPH content by 87.6%\nafter 6 h of periodic monitoring; breaking down the hydrocarbons into non-toxic environmental friendly\nproducts. Kinetics analysis and evaluation shows pseudo - first order mechanism for the Fenton treatment with a calculated rate constant of 0.226 h-1 and half life of 3 h 4 min. The Fenton method is found to\nbe very effective and efficient not only for the removal of the diesel contaminant, but also for the\nrestoration of lost physicochemical properties occasioned by the effect of the contaminant. The environmental friendliness and fast response time towards effective clean up gives the technique a cutting\nedge advantage over other conventional methods. It therefore presents potentials for remediation experts in outright applications on real field challenges.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "O.V.
