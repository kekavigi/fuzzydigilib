{"Nomor": 37674, "Judul": "Chaff point generation mechanism for improving fuzzy vault security", "Abstrak": "A combination of cryptographic and biometric systems, by performing specific binding technique on\ncryptographic key and biometric template, the fuzzy vault framework enhances the security level of current biometric cryptographic systems in terms of hiding secret key and protecting the template. Although the original scheme suggests the use of error-correction techniques (e.g. the Reed\u2013Solomon code) to reconstruct the original polynomial, recent implementations do not share the same point of view. Instead, cyclic redundant code (CRC) is applied to identify the genuine polynomial from a set of candidates due to its simplicity. Within the scope of this study, the authors address a significant flaw of current CRC-based fuzzy vault schemes, which allows the potential of successful blend substitution attack. To overcome this problem, an integration of two novel modules into general fuzzy vault scheme, namely chaff point generator and verifier, is proposed. The new modules are designed to be integrated easily into the existing systems as well as simple to enhance. The proposed scheme can detect any modification in vault and, as a result, eliminate the blend substitution attack to improve general security. Moreover, the experimental results of this\nstudy with real-world datasets show an increase in genuine acceptance rates.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Tran Khanh Dang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Minh Tan Nguyen, Quang Hai Truong"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Mobile Biometrics", "Sumber": "IET Biometrics", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Apr 2019"}
