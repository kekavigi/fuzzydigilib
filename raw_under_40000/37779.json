{"Nomor": 37779, "Judul": "Distinct magnetotransport and orbital fingerprints of chiral bobbers", "Abstrak": "While chiral magnetic skyrmions have been attracting significant attention in the past years, recently, a\nnew type of chiral particle emerging in thin films\u2014a chiral bobber\u2014has been theoretically predicted and\nexperimentally observed. Here, based on theoretical arguments, we uncover that these novel chiral states possess inherent transport fingerprints that allow for their unambiguous electrical detection in systems comprising several types of chiral states. We reveal that unique transport and orbital characteristics of bobbers root in the nontrivial magnetization distribution in the vicinity of the Bloch points, and demonstrate that tuning the details of the Bloch point topology can be used to drastically alter the emergent response properties of chiral bobbers to external fields, which bears great potential for spintronics applications and cognitive computing.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "M.
