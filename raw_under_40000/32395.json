{"Nomor": 32395, "Judul": "Robot Cooperative Behavior Learning Using Single-Shot Learning From Demonstration and Parallel Hidden Markov Models", "Abstrak": "For robots to become collaborative assistants, they\nneed to be capable of naturally interacting with users in real environments.\nThey also need to be able to learn new skills from\nnon-expert users. In this letter, we present a novel parallel hidden\nMarkov model (PaHMM) architecture for learning from demonstration\n(LfD), which allows a robot to learn a sequence of cooperative\nand non-cooperative behaviors from a single demonstration\n(single-shot) of a task-based human\u2013robot interaction from\ntwo interacting teachers. During teaching, the robot learns both a\nhuman\u2013robot interactionmodel and an object interactionmodel in\norder to be able to effectively determine its own behaviors. Experiments\nwith a Baxter robot and several teachers were conducted\nto validate the ability of the robot to learn both cooperative and\nnon-cooperative behaviors during a task-based interaction. Comparison\nexperiments also show the robustness of our approach to\nspatial variations from the demonstrated behaviors and tracking\nerrors when compared to other approaches.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "JEAN-FRANCOIS LAFLECH [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["SHANE SAUNDERSON"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "Learning from demonstration (LfD), physical human\u2013robot interaction, model learning for control.", "Sumber": "IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS, VOL. 4, NO. 2, APRIL 2019", "Staf Input/Edit": "SYSTEM \u00a0\n                                     Rita Nurainni, S.I.Pus", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
