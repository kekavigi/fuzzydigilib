{"Nomor": 37398, "Judul": "Construction of Residential Landscape Environment Evaluation System for Elderly with Mild Cognitive Impairment", "Abstrak": "In the face of aging population, the residential landscape environment must meet the needs of the senior citizen. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is one of the common diseases for the elderly population. The landscape environment, as a natural resource for medical assistance and rehabilitation, needs the adaption in favor of the elderly with MCI. In this paper, the indicator is selected from the three aspects of rehabilitation, safety and ecological environment, and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to establish an evaluation system composed of the target, the criterion and the indicator. With the application of Yaahp software, the weights of indicators are ranked based on the evaluation of 10 evaluators from different fields. The results show that the indicators such as dynamic space, vegetation coverage, landscape naturalness, landscape aesthetics, static space, identifiability, rehabilitation facilities and accessibility have relatively higher weights and should be prioritized in the construction of residential landscape environment. Meanwhile, other indicators should also be taken into consideration so as to make the residential landscape more perfect.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lifang Qiao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ke Ma, Jian Zhou, Chaoping Chen"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Mild Cognitive Impairment, The Elderly, Landscape Environment, Residential Community, Evaluation", "Sumber": "www.neuroquantology.com ; NeuroQuantology | June 2018 | Volume 16 | Issue 6 | Page 920-925 | doi: 10.14704/nq.2018.16.6.1198", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Mar 2019"}
