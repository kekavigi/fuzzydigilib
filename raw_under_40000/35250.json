{"Nomor": 35250, "Judul": "Microplastics in wastewater treatment plants: Detection, occurrence and removal", "Abstrak": "Microplastics have aroused increasing concern as they pose threats to aquatic species as well as human\nbeings. They do not only contribute to accumulation of plastics in the environment, but due to absorption\nthey can also contribute to spreading of micropollutants in the environment. Studies indicated that\nwastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) play an important role in releasing microplastics to the environment. Therefore, effective detection of the microplastics and understanding their occurrence and fate\nin WWTPs are of great importance towards microplastics control. In this review, the up-to-date status on\nthe detection, occurrence and removal of microplastics in WWTPs are comprehensively reviewed.\nSpecifically, the different techniques used for collecting microplastics from both wastewater and sewage\nsludge, and their pretreatment and characterization methods are reviewed and analyzed. The key aspects\nregarding microplastics occurrence in WWTPs, such as concentrations, total discharges, materials, shapes\nand sizes are summarized and compared. Microplastics removal in different treatment stages and their\nretention in sewage sludge are explored. The development of potential microplastics-targeted treatment\ntechnologies is also presented. Although previous researches in microplastics have undoubtedly\nimproved our level of understanding, it is clear that much remains to be learned about microplastics in\nWWTPs, as many unanswered questions and thereby concerns still remain; some of these important\nfuture research areas are outlined. The key challenges appear to be to harmonize detection methods as\nwell as microplastics mitigation from wastewater and sewage sludge.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jing Sun [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiaohu Dai.,Qilin Wang.,Mark C.M. van Loosdrecht., Bing-Jie Ni"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Microplastics Wastewater treatment plant detection Occurrence Sewage sludge Treatment technologies", "Sumber": "Water Research 152 (2019) 21-37", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Feb 2019"}
