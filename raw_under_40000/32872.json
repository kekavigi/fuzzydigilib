{"Nomor": 32872, "Judul": "The accurate estimation of GPR migration velocity and comparison of imaging methods", "Abstrak": "In order to improve the resolution of GPR profiles from the perspective of data processing, the migration technique is applied to forward and measured GPR profiles. Given the shortcomings of the conventional GPR migration velocity determination method, such as strong randomness, uncontrollable error and massive consumption\nof workforce and material resources, therefore, a new method for determining GPR migration velocity based on\ncross-correlation analysis and least square fitting has been proposed. According to the determined velocity, three\nmigration algorithms (Kirchhoff, F\\\\K and finite difference) can be used to process the forward and measured\nGPR profiles (pipes detection), the migration effect evaluated from image display, the information entropy, the\noperational efficiency and the accuracy of the determined velocity also reflected from migration results. At the\nsame time, the radius inversion is realized under the coordinate points picked up by the cross-correlation analysis\nand fitted equations. In addition, a series of studies show that the migration velocity determined by the method\nproposed in this paper can be used not only to migrate GPR profiles, but to converge the hyperbola in profiles\ncompletely, which indicates the velocity is relatively accurate. By analyzing the effect of the GPR profiles migrated\nby three algorithms, it can be found that the F\\\\K algorithm has a strong applicability to the forward and measured profiles of GPR and that the radius inversion errors of forward and measured profiles can be controlled\nbelow 6% and 12% respectively.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Fan Cui  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Siyuan Li, Libing Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Ground penetrating radar Migration velocity Cross-correlation analysis Least square fitting Migration algorithms Radius inversion", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 159 (2018) 573\u2013585, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.09.038", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Jan 2019"}
