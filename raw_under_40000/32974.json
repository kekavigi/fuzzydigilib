{"Nomor": 32974, "Judul": "Study And Application Of A New Blockage Remover In Polymer Injection Wells", "Abstrak": "With the extensive application of polymer flooding technology in offshore oilfields, the plugging in\npolymer injection wells has become more and more severe, which seriously affects the oil displacement\neffect and regular production of oilfields. In this paper, a new kind of blockage remover has been\ndeveloped and evaluated by rheological behavior experiments, dissolution experiments and core\nflooding experiments. The results reveal that this new blockage remover can effectively reduce the\nviscosity of polymer and completely degrade the reservoir blockage with low corrosion rate. It is\nbeneficial to long-term production of oil wells in offshore oilfield. Results of core flooding experiments\nshow that this new blockage remover can relieve polymer damage and improve permeability. The agent\nhas been applied in LD10-1 oilfield in 2016, the daily injection rate increased significantly after\nstimulation.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "YIYONG PAN [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Changlong Liu, Liqiang Zhao, Feng, Yigang Liu, Pingli Liu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Polymer injection wells, Formation plugging, Blockage remover, Performance evaluation, Field application", "Sumber": "Petroleum 4 (2018) 329-336 - KeAi, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.03.014", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Jan 2019"}
