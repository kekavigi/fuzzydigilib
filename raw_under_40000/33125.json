{"Nomor": 33125, "Judul": "Discrete and broadband electron acceleration in Jupiter\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds powerful aurora", "Abstrak": "The most intense auroral emissions from Earth\u2019s polar regions, called discrete for their sharply defined spatial configurations, are generated by a process involving coherent acceleration of electrons\nby slowly evolving, powerful electric fields directed along the magnetic field lines that connect Earth\u2019s space environment to its polar regions1,2. In contrast, Earth\u2019s less intense auroras are generally\ncaused by wave scattering of magnetically trapped populations of hot electrons (in the case of diffuse aurora) or by the turbulent or stochastic downward acceleration of electrons along magnetic field\nlines by waves during transitory periods (in the case of broadband or Alfv\u00e9nic aurora)3,4. Jupiter\u2019s relatively steady main aurora has a power density that is so much larger than Earth\u2019s that it has been\ntaken for granted that it must be generated primarily by the discrete auroral process5\u20137. However, preliminary in situ measurements of Jupiter\u2019s auroral regions yielded no evidence of such a process8\u201310.\nHere we report observations of distinct, high-energy, downward, discrete electron acceleration in Jupiter\u2019s auroral polar regions. We also infer upward magnetic-field-aligned electric potentials of up to\n400 kiloelectronvolts, an order of magnitude larger than the largest potentials observed at Earth11. Despite the magnitude of these upward electric potentials and the expectations from observations at Earth, the downward energy flux from discrete acceleration is less at Jupiter than that caused by broadband or stochastic processes, with broadband and stochastic characteristics that are substantially\ndifferent from those at Earth.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "B.H.
