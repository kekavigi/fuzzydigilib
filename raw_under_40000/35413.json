{"Nomor": 35413, "Judul": "Airborne AFMAG method motion-induced noise simulation and suppression", "Abstrak": "This paper introduces a rotation matrix method to extract and suppress the motion-induced noise in airborne\nAFMAG method. The rotation matrix method is a straight-forward method which achieves the coordinate transformation\nbased on Euler angles and predicts the motion-induced noise by calculating the angle between the\nsensor's normal and the geomagnetic field in real time. The corrected data can be obtained by subtracting the predicted\nnoise fromthemovement electromagnetic data.Weanalyze the influence of the Euler angles and geomagnetic\nfield (inclination and declination) on motion-induced noise. The comparison of the simulation result with\nexisting method in literature is given and the consistency of the predicted noise by the two approaches confirm\nthe effectiveness of the proposed method. A field data motion-induced noise correction is implemented and the\nresult shows that the noise can be reduced by one or two orders of magnitude at lowfrequencies by rotation matrix\nmethod.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Fubo Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ling Huang, Yuxi Pang, Zongyang Shi, Pan Xiao, Guangyou Fang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Motion-induced noise Euler angles Airborne AFMAG method Rotation matrix Simulation and suppression", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 159 (2018) 241\u2013247, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.09.006", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Feb 2019"}
