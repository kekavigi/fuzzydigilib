{"Nomor": 32565, "Judul": "Cross-environment activity recognition using a shared semantic vocabulary", "Abstrak": "Effectively recognizing activities in smart environments requires either matching sensors\nto semantic models or labeled training data from the target environment for machine\nlearning. Combining knowledge-driven and data-driven approaches improves activity\nrecognition (AR) by providing the benefits of each while also mitigating their challenges.\nIn this paper we present the Semantic Cross-Environment Activity Recognition (SCEAR)\nsystem which is a novel method for creating semantic feature spaces and enables datadriven AR systems to transfer AR models across environments. We evaluate SCEAR using\n22 datasets from real-world smart environments. Transferred model performance is compared to models trained in the target environment and shown to provide a 39% average\nper-class improvement.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zachary E.
