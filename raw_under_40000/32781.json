{"Nomor": 32781, "Judul": "Semi-empirical model for predicting pot-hole depth in underground coal mining", "Abstrak": "Pot-hole subsidence can be induced by extracting underground coal seam at shallow depth and is a matter\nof great concern. This has been the case in some of the\ncoal mines of South Eastern Coalfields Limited, a subsidiary of Coal India Limited. Many of the old underground coal mines developed by bord and pillar\nmethod of mining lying at shallow depth are posing\nstability concerns to the habitat due to pillar collapse\nand gallery widening under the creep loading and\nweathering. This requires a systematic study for developing an in-depth analysis on various parameters\nwhich influence pot-hole occurrence and also for formulating suitable predictive models. A study was conducted to analyse the pot-hole subsidence data related\nto 34 pot-hole cases and develop a semi-empirical\nmodel for simulating pot-hole depth. This study was\ncarried out in some of the Indian coal mines during\ndifferent stages of coal extraction, i.e. development\nand depillaring. Data analysis indicates that height\nand width of extraction, thickness of soil and rock\nlayers, weighted density and compressive strength are\nkey contributing parameters for the occurrence of\npot-hole subsidence. The predicted results match with\nthe actual pot-hole depth measured in the field, validating the model.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lokhande D.
