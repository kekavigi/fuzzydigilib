{"Nomor": 37629, "Judul": "Impacts of Metal?Organic Frameworks on Structure andPerformance of Polyamide Thin-Film Nanocomposite Membranes", "Abstrak": "Metal?organic frameworks (MOFs), a class ofhybrid organic?inorganic materials, have recently attractedtremendous interests in the fabrication of thin-film nano-composite (TFN) membranes with exceptional permselectiv-ity. However, the structure?performance relationship of suchmembranes, which is a function of both MOF type andmembrane fabrication procedure, has not been elucidated inthe literature. In this study, three types of hydro-stable MOFs,namely, MIL-53(Al), NH2-UiO-66, and ZIF-8, were used tofabricate TFN nanofiltration membranes via both blending(BL) and preloading interfacial polymerization methods.Results show that the incorporation of MOFs could enhancewater permeability of TFN membranes to 7.2 L/(m2\u00b7h\u00b7bar) at most ( TFNNH2?UiO?66-BL-0.10%), about 1.3 times of thecorresponding thin-film composite membranes, without sacrificing their selectivity to reject NaCl (>40%) and xylose (>65%).Membrane characterization revealed that MOFs decreased the cross-linking degree while increasing the membrane thickness,surface negative charge, and roughness of the polyamide active layer. MIL-53(Al) were found to bind with polyamide viareacting with piperazine, whereas weaker polyamide?MOF interactions were observed for NH2-UiO-66 and ZIF-8. Thisdifference, along with the hydrophilicity of MOF particles, explained the varied permselectivity of different TFN membranes.Compared to pristine polyamide membranes, the TFN membranes demonstrated higher or comparable efficiencies in removinga set of six pharmaceuticals (PhACs), which were determined by the molecular properties of PhACs and membrane structure.Thefindings of this study deepen our understanding of the roles that MOFs play in regulating membrane performance,promoting molecular design of MOF-incorporated TFN membranes via precise control of MOF?polymer interactions.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Yang-ying_Zhao_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/165116"}, "Penulis": "Yang-ying Zhao, [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yan-ling Liu,Xiao-mao Wang,Xia Huang,and Yuefeng F.
