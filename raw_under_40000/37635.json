{"Nomor": 37635, "Judul": "Targeted and Multifunctional Technology for Identification betweenHepatocellular Carcinoma and Liver Cirrhosis", "Abstrak": "Continuously updated diagnostic methods and advancedimaging methods have led to an increase in the early detection rate ofsmall liver cancer; however, even with current diagnosis methods, it isstill challenging to accurately judge a nodule with a diameter less than 2cm whether it is hepatocellular carcinoma or liver cirrhosis. To solvethis issue, a new technology is needed to distinguish above two kinds ofliver nodules. There is an emerging imaging method that improvestissue resolution and sensitivity to detect micronodules with diametersless than 2 cm. To detect micronodules, photoacoustic imaging wasused to provide noninvasive images at depths of several centimeterswith a resolution of approximately 100?m. To improve specificity, wedeveloped a probe that specifically targets hepatocellular carcinoma byrecognizing the biomarker GPC3 on the hepatocellular carcinoma cellmembrane. The probe not only has a strong photoacoustic signal but also has a magnetic resonance signal. Furthermore, thematerial owns photothermal effect that absorbs longer wavelength light and releases heat that effectively and accurately killstumor cells, thus improving patient\u2019s survival and postoperative quality of life. Herein, we present a new technology that usesphotoacoustic imaging to image and target microhepatocellular carcinoma biological processes derived from liver cirrhosis withhigh spatial resolution.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Han_Deng_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/165139"}, "Penulis": "Han Deng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wenting Shang,Guanhua Lu,Pengyu Guo,Ting Ai,?Chihua Fang,?and Jie Tian"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "small hepatocellular carcinoma, liver cirrhosis, differential diagnosis, photoacoustic imaging, GPC3,photothermal therapy", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
