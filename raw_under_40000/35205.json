{"Nomor": 35205, "Judul": "Enzymatic decolorization of melanoidins from molasses wastewater by immobilized keratinase", "Abstrak": "The aim of this work was to study the ability of commercial immobilized hydrolases in the decolorization of\nmolasses wastewater. Commercial immobilized keratinase obtained the highest decolorization yield\n(86.6\u201391.1%) among all of commercial immobilized enzymes tested. Immobilized keratinase had the potential to\nreplace immobilized oxidoreductase to decolorize molasses wastewater. Keratinase from Meiothermus taiwanensis\nWR-220 (KMT) immobilized on modified bagasse cellulose obtained a decolorization yield of 84.7\u201390.2%. It\nremoved 60.2\u201365.6% of colorants and 61.4\u201369.8% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) for 5 days continuously.\nNotably, the treatment cost was less than 0.15 dollar per ton. Immobilized KMT-wt had similar performance with\ncommercial immobilized keratinase in bleaching molasses wastewater. Importantly, it was more economic.\nFinally, the results confirmed that additional reaction catalyzing the unsaturated bonds to destroy the conjugated\nsystem by keratinase, weakening the chromogenic group of melanoidins. Accordingly, this work is\nmeaningful to the industrial decolorization of molasses wastewater.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zedong Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Delin Li.,Xin Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Molasses wastewater Decolorization yield Melanoidins Conjugate system Immobilized keratinase", "Sumber": "Bioresource Technology 280 (2019) 165\u2013172", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Feb 2019"}
