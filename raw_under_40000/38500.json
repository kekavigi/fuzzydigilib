{"Nomor": 38500, "Judul": "Before the New Bauhaus:  From Industrial Drawing to Art and  Design Education in Chicago", "Abstrak": "In  his  recent  book,  Art  Subjects:  Making  Artists  in  the  American  University, Howard  Singerman  describes  as  ironic  the  fact  that  when the design curriculum developed at the German Bauhaus in the 1920s was assimilated in the United States some fifteen years later it was as instruction in \u201cfine arts.\u201dThe irony, however, is both less  and  more  than  Singerman\u2019s  observation  allows.  Less,  I  will  argue, because distinctions between what counted as instruction in design, or industrial arts, and instruction in fine arts in the United States never have been clear-cut. But also more, because it is exactly the kind of statement that makes it difficult for us to reconstruct \nthe tangled trajectories of art and design education in the United States. For much of the twentieth century, the arts were made to simultaneously serve a variety of purposes (and political positions) \nin American education\u2014at once vocational training and a source of spiritual uplift; the basis of progressive educational reform and a vehicle for social control. This is because two powerful cultural \ntendencies converged in the United States during the last decades of  the  nineteenth  century:  the  pragmatic  interdependence  of  art  and industry established in the immediate aftermath of the Civil \nWar (as business leaders advocated mass instruction in art as a way of  enhancing  the  country\u2019s  competitiveness  in  emerging  world  markets), and the utopian focus on art as an arena of social improvement (as conservatives and progressive reformers alike reacted to the excesses of capitalist competition). Modern American art instruction emerged out of these contradictions, as links between the acquisition of manual or industrial skills and the development of the intellectual or moral faculties were forged in public understanding", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Barbara Jaffee [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Industrial design; Modernist art; Drawing; Employment; Art and design education", "Sumber": "Design Issues. 21(1):41-62", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Mei 2019"}
