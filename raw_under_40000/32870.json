{"Nomor": 32870, "Judul": "Application of underground microseismic monitoring for ground failure and secure longwall coal mining operation: A case study in an Indian mine", "Abstrak": "Longwall mining technique has been widely used around the globe due to its safe mining process. However,\nmining operations are suspended when various problems arise like collapse of roof falls, cracks and fractures\npropagation in the roof and complexity in roof strata behaviors. To overcome these colossal problems, an underground real time microseismic monitoring technique has been implemented in the working panel-P2 in the\nRajendra longwall underground coal mine at South Eastern Coalfields Limited (SECL), India. The target coal\nseams appears at the panel P-2 within a depth of 70 m to 76 m. In this process, 10 to 15 uniaxial geophones\nwere placed inside a borehole at depth range of 40 m to 60 m located over the working panel-P2 with high\nrock quality designation value for better seismic signal. Various microseismic events were recorded with magnitude ranging from ?5 to 2 in the Richter scale. The time-series processing was carried out to get various seismic\nparameters like activity rate, potential energy, viscosity rate, seismic moment, energy index, apparent volume\nand potential energy with respect to time. The used of these parameters helped tracing the events, understanding\ncrack and fractures propagation and locating both high and low stress distribution zones prior to roof fall occurrence. In most of the cases, the events were divided into three stage processes: initial or preliminary, middle or\nbuilding, and final or falling. The results of this study reveal that underground microseismic monitoring provides\nsufficient prior information of underground weighting events. The information gathered during the study was\nconveyed to the mining personnel in advance prior to roof fall event. This permits to take appropriate action\nfor safer mining operations and risk reduction during longwall operation", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "G.K.
