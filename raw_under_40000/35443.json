{"Nomor": 35443, "Judul": "Low Operating Voltage and Highly Pressure-Sensitive Printed Sensor for Healthcare Monitoring with Analogic Amplifier Circuit", "Abstrak": "Flexible printed analogic amplifier circuits are\nrequired in wearable sensors to enhance their sensitivity for\napplication in various fields such as healthcare, artificial skins,\nand soft robotics. Various technologies have been proposed to\ndevelop wearable sensors for healthcare. However, the\ndevelopment of piezopolymer-based printed healthcare devices\nfor monitoring human vital signs that simultaneously achieve\nhigh sensitivity and low operating voltage remains a challenging\ntask. Here, a highly pressure-sensitive printed sensor with low\noperating voltage is demonstrated and applied to monitor\nhuman pulse wave velocity (PWV).....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Tomohito Sekine [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Alexandre Ga?t? is, Jun Sato, Kohei Miyazawa, Kosuke Muraki, Rei Shiwaku, Yasunori Takeda, Hiroyuki Matsui, Daisuke Kumaki, Fabrice Domingues Dos Santos, Atsushi Miyabo, Micae?l Charbonneau, Shizuo Tokito"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "wearable sensor, printed analogic circuit, pulse wave measurement, ferroelectricity, low voltage operating", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Feb 2019"}
