{"Nomor": 33871, "Judul": "Gravity flow characterization of fine granular material for Block Caving", "Abstrak": "Block and Panel Caving are based on the action of gravity for ore breakage and transport, so that material\nreaches the drawpoint through gravity flow. The study of caved rock flow is of vital importance for defining the\ndesign, planning, ore recovery and consequently the profitability of a mining project. This study experimentally\ninvestigates the influence of moisture content and fine material on the draw-zone and hang-up frequency.\nLaboratory experiments were carried out on a physical model (scale 1:75) using a Load Haul Dump system\n(LHD). The results show that the dimensions, the diameter, and the height of the draw-zone depend on three\nvariables: moisture content, particle size, and accumulated extraction mass. For the case of tests with moisture,\nthe increase in diameter reaches a maximum value and becomes almost constant. The ratio of the flow zone\nwidth was found to be in the range of 2.7\u20133 times the drawpoint width, which is within the range of current\nblock cave design guidelines. Additionally, with moisture contents over 6%, \u201cnon-flow\u201d conditions occur due to\nformation of a cohesive arch. Results of our study were compared with data from the Esmeralda mine where the\neffects of cohesive arch formation associated with fine material and moisture content were also observed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Vanessa S\u00e1nchez [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ra\u00fal L.
