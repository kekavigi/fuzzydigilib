{"Nomor": 33229, "Judul": "Abundance and characteristics of microplastics in market bivalves from South Korea", "Abstrak": "Microplastic contamination in marine organisms is a growing environmental issue with implications for\nseafood safety. Among marine organisms, shellfish are considered to be an important route of human\nexposure to microplastics because they filter a large volume of seawater while feeding and, thus,\naccumulate microplastics from seawater; furthermore, they are consumed whole, without gut removal.\nIn this study, a market survey was carried out to understand microplastic contamination in domestic\nbivalves sold in fishery markets in three major cities of South Korea. Four popular bivalve species, oyster\n(Crassostrea gigas), mussel (Mytilus edulis), Manila clam (Tapes philippinarum) and scallop (Patinopecten\nyessoensis), were selected as monitoring species, which together account for 79e84% of total shellfish\nconsumption in Korea. The mean concentration of microplastics in these four species was 0.15 \u00b1 0.20 n/g\nand 0.97 \u00b1 0.74 n/individual. Fragments and particles smaller than 300 mm were dominant shape and\nsize, accounting for 76% and 65% of total microplastics, respectively. Polyethylene (PE), polypropylene\n(PP), polystyrene (PS), and polyester were the major polymer types. Interestingly, differing polymer\ncompositions were observed according to the culture methods and habitat characteristics of each species. PS was found in high proportions in oysters and mussels cultured in the upper layer of the water\ncolumn, while the proportions decreased and those of polyester increased in Manila clams and scallops\nthat were cultured in intertidal sediments or the middle and bottom layers of the water column. The\nannual dietary intake of microplastics by the Korean population via shellfish consumption was estimated\nas 212 n/person$year. Our results suggested that microplastic pollution is widespread in commercial\nbivalves and we recommend a systematic and integrative market-basket survey to clarify the current\nstatus of human exposure to microplastics.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Youna Cho [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Won Joon Shim.,Mi Jang.,Gi Myung Han.,Sang Hee Hong"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Microplastics Contamination Bivalves Seafood Market survey", "Sumber": "Environmental Pollution 245 (2019) 1107-1116", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Jan 2019"}
