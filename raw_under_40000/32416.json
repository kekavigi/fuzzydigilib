{"Nomor": 32416, "Judul": "Public Transportation Development and Traffic Accident Prevention in Indonesia (IATSS Research 40 (2017) 76\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd80)", "Abstrak": "Traffic accidents have long been known as an iceberg for comprehending the discrepancies of traffic management and entire transportation systems. Figures detailing traffic accidents in Indonesia, as is the case in many other countries, show significantly high numbers and severity levels; these types of totals are also evident in Jakarta, the highest-populated city in the country. While the common consensus recognizes that traffic accidents are the results of three different factor types, namely, human factors, vehicle factors, and external factors (including road conditions), human factors have the strongest influence\u2014and figures on a worldwide scale corroborate that assertion. We, however, try to pinpoint the issues of non-human factors in light of increasing traffic accidents in Indonesia, where motorbike accidents account for the majority of incidents. We then consider three important pillars of action: the development of public transportation, improvement of the road ratio, and traffic management measures.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SUTANTO SOEHODHO [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Traffic accidents, Non-human factors, Public transportation, Road ratio, Traffic management", "Sumber": "IATSS Research 40 (2017) 76\u201380", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yoninur Almira", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
