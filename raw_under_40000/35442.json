{"Nomor": 35442, "Judul": "Structural Micromodulation on Bi3+-Doped Ba2Ga2GeO7 Phosphor with Considerable Tunability of the Defect-Oriented Optical Properties", "Abstrak": "We report a new Ba2Ga2GeO7:Bi3+ phosphor with broad emission almost covers the entire visible area generated from different bismuth emission centers in crystalline structure. The two peaks\u2019 positions are invariably located at 497 and 611 nm which were independently excited by 365 and 387 nm excitation sources.....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Huimin Li [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ran Pang, Yanqing Luo, Haiyan Wu, Su Zhang, Lihong Jiang, Da Li, Chengyu Li, Hongjie Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "phosphor, luminescence, bismuth, WLEDs, vacancy, color-tunable", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Feb 2019"}
