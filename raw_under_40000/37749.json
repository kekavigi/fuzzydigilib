{"Nomor": 37749, "Judul": "THE INFLUENCE OF CONSUMER MINDSET AND  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSILITY ON  PURCHASE INTENTION", "Abstrak": "We examined the influence of mindset on consumers when they are deciding whether or not \nto purchase products on the basis of corporate social responsibility (CSR) considerations. We \nconducted  3  experiments  in  which  294  participants  filled  out  a  survey  about  their  purchase  \ndecisions.   The   results   showed   that   companies\u2019   CSR   effectively   promoted   consumers\u2019   \npurchase  intention.  In  addition,  a  global  mindset  increased  CSR-based  purchase  intention,  \nwhereas  a  local  mindset  weakened  purchase  intention.  The  effect  of  purchase  intention  on  \nconsumers\u2019 mindset was shown through colors: Red stimulated consumers\u2019 local mindset and \nreduced  their  CSR-based  purchase  intention,  whereas  blue  stimulated  their  global  mindset  \nand enhanced their CSR-based purchase intention. Thus, we recommend that marketing staff \nuse colors to manipulate consumers\u2019 mindset during CSR-based purchase decision making.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "XIAOPING  LIU [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["LIJING  MAO,  AND  WENXIANG  DENG"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "corporate social responsibility, consumer mindset, global mindset, local mindset,  purchase intention, consumer decision making.", "Sumber": "SOCIAL BEHAVIOR AND PERSONALITY, 2018,  46 (10), 1647\u20131656", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Apr 2019"}
