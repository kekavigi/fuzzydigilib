{"Nomor": 37420, "Judul": "Properties of Hydrous Aluminosilicate Melts at High Pressures", "Abstrak": "In this study, we use f irst-principles molecular\ndynamics simulations to explore the behavior of anhydrous\naluminosilicate melt with a stoichiometry of NaAlSi2O6 up to\npressures of ?30 GPa and temperatures between 2500 and\n4000 K. We also examine the effect of water (?4 wt % H2O)\non the equation of state and transport properties of the\naluminosilicate melt and relate them to atomistic scale\nchanges in the melt structure. Our results show that water\nreduces the density and bulk modulus of the anhydrous melt.\nHowever, the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus of the\nhydrous melt is larger than that of the anhydrous melt. The\npressure dependence of the transport property exhibits an\nanomalous behavior...", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Suraj K.
