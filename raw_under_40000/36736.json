{"Nomor": 36736, "Judul": "Biodiesel production through algal cultivation in urban wastewater using algal floway", "Abstrak": "The aim of this work was to study algal floway (AFW) to treat urban wastewater and to evaluate biomass\nproductivity, lipid contents and biodiesel production. The results indicated the seasonal average algae productivity of 34.83 g dry weight m2 d?1 with a nutrient removal rate of 2.52 g m2 d?1\nN and 1.25 g m2 d?1\nP while\nthe lipid content ranged between 14 and 22% of dry cell weight with the highest lipid productivity of\n9.29 g m?2 d?1 during summer. Biodiesel quality was superior during summer with high centane number and\ncold filter plugging point values. High eicosapentaenoic acid content was found during winter growth cycles.\nAFW algae community was dominated by pennate diatoms during all growing seasons. This study is one of its\nkinds in Indian wastewaters and it provides fundamental information for further optimization and use of AFW to\ntreat domestic wastewater and to produce algae biofuel feedstock.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Thomas Kiran Marella [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Aviraj Datta., Mukund D.
