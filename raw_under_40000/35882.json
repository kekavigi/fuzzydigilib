{"Nomor": 35882, "Judul": "UNDERSTANDING THE  UNPREDICTABILITY OF  CANCER USING  CHAOS  THEORY AND  MODERN ART TECHNIQUES", "Abstrak": "The unpredictability of cancer poses a threat to personalized cures. Although cancer is studied as a chaotic system, the shape of its unpredictability, known as the strange attractor, is unclear. In this article, the author discusses a conceptual model, building on the strange attractor in cancer phase space. Using techniques of cubism, the author defines the 10-dimensional phase space and then, using an abstract expressionist approach, represents the strange attractor, which twists and turns in multi dimensions, indicating the unpredictability of cancer. This conceptual model motivates the identification of specific experiments for a system-level understanding of cancer.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Dhruba Deb [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "cancer, unpredictability, chaos, strange attractor, phase  space, hallmarks of cancer, single-cell variability, cubism, abstract  expressionism", "Sumber": "Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncology  Research, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Mar 2019"}
