{"Nomor": 35888, "Judul": "GIVE ME GESTALT ! P REFERENCE FOR  CUBIST ARTWORKS  REVEALING H IGH DETECTABILITY OF  OBJECTS", "Abstrak": "In cubist paintings by Picasso, Braque and Gris it is possible to detect everyday objects like guitars, \nbottles or jugs, although they are often difficult to decipher. In this art-science collaborative study the \nauthors found that participants without expertise in cubism appreciated cubist artworks more if they \nwere able to detect concealed objects in them. The finding of this strong correlation between detecta-\nbility and preference offers wide implications for art history and human cognition as it points to a mech-\nanism that allows us to derive pleasure from searching for and finding meaningful patterns.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Claudia Muth  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Robert Pepperell, Claus- Christian Carbon"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Cubism, gestalt, visual perception", "Sumber": "Leonardo. 2013, Vol. 46 Issue 5, p488-489. 2p. 1 Graph", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Mar 2019"}
