{"Nomor": 38346, "Judul": "ARCHITECTURAL CONSERVATION AS A TOOL FOR CULTURAL CONTINUITY: A Focus on the Built Environment of Islam", "Abstrak": "Architectural historic preservation has been used as a means to express or represent national, Islamic and even ethnic identity, and often this is linked to tourism or used to serve political ends, particularly in nation building. This article investigates agency and utility in the conservation and restoration of religious built environments in different societies in the Islamic world and its meaning to these societies today. Conservation should be interpreted more broadly than the physical continuity of historic structures; it should also enable the\ncontinuity of non-material aspects of culture.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hasan-Uddin Khan  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Stewardship; values; conservation; restoration; charter guidelines.", "Sumber": "Archnet-IJAR, Volume 9 - Issue 1 - March 2015 - (01-17)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Mei 2019"}
