{"Nomor": 32729, "Judul": "OPTIMAL CONTROL OF NONLINEAR VIBRATION RESONANCES OF SINGLE-WALLEDNANOTUBE BEAMS", "Abstrak": "An optimal time-delay feedback control method is provided to mitigate the primary\nresonance of a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) subjected to a Lorentz force excited by a\nlongitudinal magnetic field. The nonlinear governing equations of motion for the SWCNT under\nlongitudinal magnetic field are derived and the modulation equations are obtained by using the\nmethod of multiple scales. The regions of the stable feedback gain are worked out by using the\nstability conditions of eigenvalue equation. Taking the attenuation ratio as the objective function\nand the stable vibration regions as constrained conditions, the optimal control parameters are\nworked out by using minimumoptimal method. The optimal controllers are designed to control the\ndynamic behaviors of the nonlinear vibration systems. It is found that the optimal feedback gain\nobtained by the optimal method can enhance the control performance of the primary resonance\nof SWCNT devices.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "C anchang  L iu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["C huanb o  Re n,  L u  L iu,  Y ing z i  X u"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "nanotube, nonlinear vibration, optimal control, time delay, primary resonance", "Sumber": "Science Direct", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan \u00a0\n                                     Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Jan 2019"}
