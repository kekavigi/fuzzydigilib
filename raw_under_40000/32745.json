{"Nomor": 32745, "Judul": "Archaeologies of empire and environment", "Abstrak": "This paper promotes an explicit study of archaeologies of empire and environment, and advances theories and\nmethods in environmental archaeology that demonstrate that environmental practices articulate people's relationships to imperial authority. While many studies of empire take for granted that centralized organization\nand surplus production lead to political control and social inequity, in the papers assembled for this special issue,\nthe very relationship between human-environment interactions and political power becomes the object of study.\nIn this introduction, we review established archaeological approaches to empire, explain how environmental\nframeworks productively recast our understandings of imperialism, and proffer a number of avenues for continued research on the subject, including those provided by the articles in this issue. We present three overarching themes for the study of empire and environment\u2014scale, legacy, and resilience and resistance\u2014and\ndiscuss their implementation with the papers that follow. Ultimately, we argue that imperialism entails the\nmanagement of heterogeneous peoples and environments, and therefore, archaeologies of empire require the\nintegrated study of humans, landscapes, and biota.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Melissa S.
