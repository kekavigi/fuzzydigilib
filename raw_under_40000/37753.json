{"Nomor": 37753, "Judul": "Effects of thermal treatment on physical and mechanical properties of Valdieri Marble - NW Italy", "Abstrak": "The effect of high temperatures as a degrading factor of rock materials is investigated in this study. Valdieri\nMarble samples, collected in a quarry in North-western Italian Alps, were subjected to thermal cycles (ranging\nfrom 105\u00b0 to 600 \u00b0C) and to subsequent non-destructive and destructive laboratory tests with the aim of evaluating the variation of physical and mechanical properties as a function of temperature variations. Physical and\nmechanical measurements were complemented with microscopic observations on thin sections. The increase of\ncrack density with temperature and the consequent porosity increases were found to be the main causes of\ndegradation of physical and mechanical properties.\nIn general, density, ultrasonic pulse velocity, wet electrical resistivity, uniaxial compressive strength and\nYoung's moduli decrease as temperature increases. By contrast, peak strain and porosity increase. Correlations\nbetween temperature and physical-mechanical properties were proposed and compared to other relationships\nalready established in scientific literature. A damage parameter to quantify the degradation of mechanical\nproperties with temperature is also proposed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Federico Vagnon [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Chiara Colombero , Fabrizio Colombo , Cesare Comina , Anna Maria Ferrero , Giuseppe Mandrone , Sergio Carmelo Vinciguerra"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Valdieri Marble, Thermal treatment, Mechanical and physical properties, Micro-cracks", "Sumber": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrmms.2019.03.006", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Apr 2019"}
