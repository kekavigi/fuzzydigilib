{"Nomor": 33809, "Judul": "Validation of the NSCAT-5 Geophysical Model Function for Scatsat-1 Wind Scatterometer", "Abstrak": "Recent developments on the wind geophysical model function (GMF) of Ku-band scatterometers include a sea surface temperature (SST) dependent term. It has been found that the SST effects on the radar backscatter are wind speed dependent and more pronounced in vertical polarization (VV) than in horizontal polarisation (HH) at higher incidence angles, and are mainly relevant at radar wavelengths smaller than C-band. The new Ku-band GMF, NSCAT-5, is developed based on a physical model and RapidScat radar backscatter measurements, which are only available at two incidence angles, i.e., 48.8\u00b0 and 55.2\u00b0, for HH and VV beams, respectively. The objective of this paper is to verify the NSCAT-5 GMF at similar incidence angles, using data from the scatterometer onboard Indian SCATSat-1 satellite, which operates at 49.1\u00b0 (HH) and 57.9\u00b0 (VV) incidence angles. First, the SCATSat-l backscatter sensitivity to sea surface wind and SST is assessed using the C-band Advance Scatterometer (ASCAT) winds as reference. Second, the approach used to derive the NSCAT-5 GMF for RapidScat is adapted to derive a SST-dependent GMF for SCATSat-l. The new GMF will be used to consolidate the current NSCAT-5 model, and then evaluated for SCATSat-l wind retrieval", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Wenming Lin [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Marcos Portabella, Ad Stoffelen, Anton Verhoef, Zhixiong Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Wind speed , Radar measurements , Backscatter , Spaceborne radar , Oceans", "Sumber": "IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, DOI: 10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8517739", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Jan 2019"}
