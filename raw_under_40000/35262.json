{"Nomor": 35262, "Judul": "Effects of crystalline nanocellulose on wastewater-cultivated microalgal separation and biomass composition", "Abstrak": "Microalgae are renewable and promising feedstock rich in biochemicals for biofuel and bioenergy production.\nThe viability of this technology relies on the energy- and cost-efficient cultivation (culture medium used) and\nharvesting (coagulant applied) processes. The natural coagulant of crystalline nanocellulose modified with 1-(3-\naminopropyl) imidazole (CNC-APIm) was demonstrated as a green and recyclable coagulant for microalgal\nharvesting. However, optimisation is still needed to ensure its applicability to microalgae cultivated on wastewaters, no effect on biomass composition, as well as cost-effective harvesting. In this study, microalgal growth\nand nutrient removal capacity of Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris) were first investigated on two types of municipal\nwastewaters. C. vulgaris grew well on both primary and 30% (v/v) diluted centrate wastewaters with biomass\nproductivities of 0.071 \u00b1 0.005 and 0.062 \u00b1 0.006 g/(L\u00b7d), respectively. High nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies (91.1\u2013100%) were obtained. Subsequently, the wastewater-cultivated C. vulgaris was harvested using a novel natural coagulant of crystalline nanocellulose modified with 1-(3-aminopropyl) imidazole\n(CNC-APIm). Based on the optimization results of the Design of Experiments driven response surface methodology approach, the optimal conditions for maximum HEs (86.5%) and RCs (38.5 g-algae/g-CNC) responses\nwere determined for C. vulgaris under the following conditions: 0.02 g-CNC-APIm/g-algae of mass ratio, 5 s of\nCO2 sparging time, 8 min of air sparging time, and 50 ml/min of air flow rate. Moreover, no statistically significant differences were observed in the contents of carbohydrate, protein, lipid and fatty acids in the biomass\nharvested by centrifugation and CNC-APIm, respectively, suggesting that CNC-APIm would not impact the\ndownstream microalgal application. According to the rough technical and economical estimation, CNC-APIm\nwill be an alternative to conventional coagulants for commercial microalgal harvesting application.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Shuang Qiu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Lingfeng Wang.,Pascale Champagne.,Guihua Cao.,Zhipeng Chen.,Shuying Wang., Shijian Ge"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Biofuel Bioenergy Microalgae Lipid Harvesting Wastewater", "Sumber": "Applied Energy 239 (2019) 207\u2013217", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Feb 2019"}
