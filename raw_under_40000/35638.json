{"Nomor": 35638, "Judul": "Exhibitions of Power: Participatory Visual Practices in Contemporary Museums", "Abstrak": "This chapter is about participatory visual practices and public museums,\nincluding public art galleries. This may sound somewhat paradoxical, as the\nimage that comes most frequently to mind when one says \u201cmuseum\u201d is a pas-\nsive audience, standing motionless in hushed contemplation of artworks by\nlong-dead \u201cmasters,\u201d or installations and artifacts distanced from the messiness\nand contradictions of the world. Within this shrine-like atmosphere, adults\nare expected to accept the wisdom of the curators and educators, and neither\nquestion, interrupt, disobey, relate, nor reimagine. These images of the mu-\nseum, formed through actual experience as well as simply pervasive stereo-\ntypes, stand in marked contrast to what adult educators commonly think of as\nparticipatory visual practices, characterized as active, engaging, and empow-\nering. To participate is to take part, to be involved, to collaborate, to create, or\nto have agency.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Darlene E.
