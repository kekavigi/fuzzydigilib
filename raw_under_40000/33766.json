The images beamed back to Earth also show the first plant ever to sprout on the Moon, a cotton seed in a mini-biosphere experiment on Chang\u2019e-4. The mission was the first to make a soft landing on the far side of the Moon, on 3 January. On 14 January, the China National Space Administration announced plans for at least three further lunar missions. The first of those, Chang\u2019e-5, will launch before the end of this year, aiming to collect a sample of lunar material and return it to Earth.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "NATURE  EDITOR [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Astronomi", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Space", "Sumber": "NATURE | VOL 565 | 17 JANUARY 2019", "Staf Input/Edit": "pustaka bosscha", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Jan 2019"}
