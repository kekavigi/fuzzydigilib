{"Nomor": 35005, "Judul": "Structural study using 2D modeling of the potential field data and GIS technique in Sohag Governorate and its surroundings, Upper Egypt", "Abstrak": "The main purpose of the present study is to identify the surface and subsurface structural features and configuration of the basement in the area around Sohag Governorate using Geographic Information System (GIS) and\npotential field data (gravity and aeromagnetic). The hill shade was found as the most suitable image for surface\nlineament delineation and to produce a fault potential prediction map using the overlay model technique. The\nsubsurface faults and contacts were detected and traced out from the reduced to the pole (RTP) magnetic,\nBouguer gravity anomaly, and tilt derivative maps. The basement structural map of study area has been created\nbased on tilt derivative technique. The structural tectonic maps show that the E-W, NNW-SSE, and NNE-SSW\ndirections are the main trends affecting the study area. The subsurface configuration of the basement was detected using two dimensional (2D) gravity and magnetic forward modeling along preselected six long profiles\ncrossing the study area. The 2D models suggest a depth range to the basement of 400 to 4000 m", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hosni H. Ghazala [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ismael M.
