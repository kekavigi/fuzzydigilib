{"Nomor": 33239, "Judul": "Effects of the total borehole length and of the heat pump inverter on the performance of a ground-coupled heat pump system", "Abstrak": "Ground-Coupled Heat Pumps (GCHPs) are an efficient technology for building heating, cooling and DHW\nproduction, which reached a considerable development in the last decade. Accurate simulation tools are\nbecoming important for the optimization of this technology. In this paper, a code for the hourly simulation\nof GCHP systems is presented, which allows the simulation of multifunction heat pumps for heating,\ncooling-dehumidifying and DHW production, considers the presence of storage tanks, and applies both to\non\u2013off and inverter-driven heat pumps. The energy needs of a residential building in Bologna (Italy) are\nselected as case study to analyze the effects on the system performance of unbalanced seasonal loads, of\nthe total length of the borehole field and of the heat-pump inverter during a period of 80 years. The\nobtained results show that the long-term temperature decrease of the ground is small and does not cause\nrelevant decrease of the seasonal COP or increase of the seasonal EER over the years. Increasing the total\nborehole length can yield an enhancement of the seasonal performance up to 20% for heating, 8% for cooling and 5% for DHW. Using an inverter-driven heat pump instead of an on\u2013off one can improve the system efficiency up to 30% for heating, 40% for cooling and 10% for DHW.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Claudia Naldi  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Enzo Zanchini"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Ground-coupled heat pump, Dynamic simulation, Heating, Cooling, Domestic hot water, Seasonal performance.", "Sumber": "Science Direct", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Jan 2019"}
