{"Nomor": 39040, "Judul": "Iridium Oxide?Polymer Nanocomposite Electrode Materials for Water Oxidation", "Abstrak": "Nanocomposite anode materials for water oxidation\nhave been readily synthesized by electrodeposition of iridium oxide\nnanoparticles into poly(pyrrole-alkylammonium) films, previously\ndeposited onto carbon electrodes by oxidative electropolymerization of a pyrrole-alkylammonium monomer. The nanocomposite\nfilms were characterized by electrochemistry, transmission electron\nmicroscopy, and atomic force microscopy. They showed an efficient\nelectrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction. Data\nfrom Tafel plots have demonstrated that the catalytic activity of the\niridium oxide nanoparticles is maintained following their inclusion\nin the polymer matrix. Bulk electrolysis of water at carbon foam\nmodified electrodes have shown that the iridium oxide?polymer\ncomposite presents a higher catalytic activity and a better operational stability than regular oxide films", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Youssef Lattach 1.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170889"}, "Penulis": "Youssef Lattach [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Juan Francisco Rivera,Tahya Bamine,Alain Deronzier,Jean-Claude Moutet"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "iridium oxide, nanocomposites, electrode materials, electrocatalysis, oxygen evolution reaction", "Sumber": "www.acsami.org   dx.doi.org/10.1021/am5027852 | ACS Appl.
