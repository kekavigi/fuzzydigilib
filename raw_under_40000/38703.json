{"Nomor": 38703, "Judul": "A Novel Smart Microsphere with Magnetic Core and IonRecognizable Shell for Pb2+ Adsorption and Separation", "Abstrak": "Smart core?shell microspheres for selective Pb2+ adsorption and\nseparation have been developed. Each microsphere is composed of a Pb2+\nrecognizable poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-benzo-18-crown-6-acrylamide)\n(PNB) shell and a magnetic Fe3O4 core. The magnetic PNB core?shell\nmicrospheres show excellent Pb2+ adsorption selectivity among the coexisting\nCd2+, Co2+, Cr3+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, K+\n, and Ca2+ ions by forming stable\nB18C6Am/Pb2+ host?guest complexes and exhibit an interesting temperaturedependent Pb2+ adsorption. The inner independent magnetic Fe3O4 cores enable\nthe Pb2+-adsorbed microspheres with a magnetically guided aggregation to be\nseparated from the treated solution using a remotely controlled manner. The\nisothermal Pb2+ adsorption result fits well with the Freundlich isotherm. The\nmagnetic PNB core?shell microspheres show very fast adsorption of Pb2+, and\nthe adsorption process of Pb2+ onto magnetic PNB core?shell microspheres fits\nwell with the pseudo-second-order model. Moreover, Pb2+-adsorbed microspheres\ncan be regenerated by simply increasing the operation temperature and washing with deionized water. The proposed magnetic\nPNB core?shell microspheres provide a promising candidate for Pb2+ adsorbents with selectively separable and efficiently\nreusable abilities.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Ying-Mei Liu 1.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170182"}, "Penulis": "Ying-Mei Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ying-Mei Liu, Xiao-Jie Ju, Yan Xin, Wei-Chao Zheng, Wei Wang, Jie Wei, Rui Xie, Zhuang Liu,  Liang-Yin Chu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "polymer materials, magnetic microspheres, Pb2+ adsorption, host?guest chemistry, template synthesis", "Sumber": "www.acsami.org", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Jun 2019"}
