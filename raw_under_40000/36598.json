{"Nomor": 36598, "Judul": "A Techno-economic Model for Heating of a Greenhouse Site Using Waste Heat", "Abstrak": "Considering a greenhouse site, a waste-to-heat\ngreenhouse heating techno-economic model is presented in\nthis study. The contribution of the parameters affecting the\nheating costs in the total expenses has been put forward.\nThe economic model can be used for different types of heat\nsources and allows making a comparison easily. According\nto the results, the main operating cost is the heating cost.\nAccording to the parametric study, the effect of the cover\nmaterial on the heat losses is very little but the effects of the\nnight temperature set points have an important effect on the\nheat losses.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mehmet Z.
