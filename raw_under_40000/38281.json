{"Nomor": 38281, "Judul": "Enhancing the Therapy Experience Using Principles of Video Game Design", "Abstrak": "Purpose: This article considers the potential benefits that applying design principles from contemporary video games may have on enhancing therapy experiences.\nMethod: Six principles of video game design are presented, and their relevance for enriching clinical experiences isdiscussed.\nResults: The motivational and learning benefits of each design principle have been discussed in the education literature as having positive impacts on student motivationand learning and are related here to aspects of clinical practice. The essential experience principle suggests connecting all aspects of the experience around a central emotion or cognitive connection. The discovery principle promotes indirect learning in focused environments. The risk-taking principle addresses the uncertainties clients face when attempting newly learned skills in novel situations. \nThe generalization principle encourages multiple opportunities for skill transfer. The reward system principle directly relates to the scaffolding of frequent and varied feedback in treatment.\nLast, the identity principle can assist clients in using their newly learned communication skills to redefine self-perceptions.\nConclusion: These principles highlight areas for research and interventions that may be used to reinforce or advance current practice.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "John Wm.
