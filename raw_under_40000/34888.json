We studied two scenarios: 1) a right-lateral, strike-slip faulting earthquake event\nwith surface wave magnitude (Ms) 7.4 occurred on the north to northeast (NNE) oriented\nTan-Lu fault zone (TLFZ) with a location about 100 km away from BSST (the far field);\nand 2) a left-lateral strike-slip event with magnitude Ms4.1 occurred in the direct vicinity\nto BSST (the near field) on the northwest to west (NWW) Zhangjiakou-Penglai fault\nzone (Zhang-Peng Fault Zone, or ZPFZ). Selections of these two scenario events are\nbased on the characterization of the actual seismo-tectonic settings and representation of\nearthquake history in the Bohai region. We studied the impacts of these two scenario\nevents on BSST in terms of longitudinal compression, bending, and tunnel crosssection\u2019s\novaling deformation. As a preliminary study, we excluded the analysis of\nformation-structure interaction and focused on the ground motion parameters expressed\nas the maximum displacement, the peak ground velocity (PGV) and peak ground\nacceleration (PGA) of the free seismic wave field surrounding the tunnel walls. This\nsimplification is acceptable for the fact that BSST is planned to be constructed in the\ngranite bedrock formation in which the inertial contrast between the formation and the\nstructure is minimal. Seismic hazard assessment for tunnels is completely different from\nthe assessment for above-ground buildings. It is also substantially different from\nassessment for tunnels built in soil formations, for which the formation (soil)-structure\ninteraction evaluation is critical. We use semi-analytical approach for assessing the\nseismic impact of the far field, large event to BSST; whereas use the two-dimensional (2D) finite difference time domain (FDTD) numerical simulation technique for assessing\nthe response of BSST to the seismic load of the near field, smaller event. The preliminary\nresults suggest that 1) the impact of the low frequency, far field event has very subtle\nimpact to BSST in terms of longitudinal compression, bending, and cross-section ovaling;\nand 2) the impact of the high-frequency, near field event has little impact to BSST in\nterms of longitudinal compression and bending; while has a measurable impact to crosssection\novaling. However, this kind of deformation is within the limit of tolerance under\nearthquake-resistant design. Over all, the seismic risk posed by regional large\nearthquakes and local small events to BSST is within allowable risk threshold and\nmanageable with the enforcement of earthquake resistant code.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lanbo Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yuan Gao, Bin Liu, Shucai Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Seismic hazard, strong ground motion, Bohai Strait subsea tunnel (BSST), scenario earthquakes, longitudinal compression, bending, ovaling deformation", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics, S0926-9851(18)30904-2 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2019.02.005", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Feb 2019"}
