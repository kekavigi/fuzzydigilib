{"Nomor": 36901, "Judul": "Study of the development and performance of centralized wastewater treatment plants in Chinese industrial parks", "Abstrak": "The centralized wastewater treatment plant (CWWTP) was requested as an indispensable and mandatory\ninfrastructure in Chinese national industrial parks (NIPs) since 2015, which plays an important role\nin tackling with industrial water contamination associated with intensive manufacturing activities in\nindustrial parks. In this study, the development trajectory and status of 347 CWWTPs in 157 NIPs were\nanalyzed, with the elaboration of the vintage year, capacity, energy consumption, operating cost,\ntreatment technology, pollutants removal efficiency, and other operating parameters. The key findings\nare as follows: The construction time lag between CWWTPs and NIPs is generally 12e22 years, and the\ntime lag is shorter for younger NIPs. In 2016, the total actual treatment capacity the CWWTPs was over\n4.4 billion tons, accounting for 22.6% of all industrial wastewater discharged in China. The total annual\noperating cost and energy consumption were 5.5 billion Chinese Yuan (CNY) and 1.7 billion kWh. The\nCWWTPs with capacity load rate ranging from 90% to 110% usually had relatively low operating cost and\nenergy consumption per ton wastewater. The removal rates of 17 pollutant indicators listed in the\ndischarge standards were generally higher than 60%, except the total nitrogen (TN). Meanwhile, over 92%\nof the CWWTPs have met the requested discharge standards. Aerobic biological process was the most\npopular technology applied in the CWWTPs, accounting for 86% of total capacity. Against the features of\nthe CWWTPs in NIPs, eight key measures were proposed to improve the performance of CWWTPs", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Wanqiu Hu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jinping Tian.,Na Zang.,Yang Gao.,Lujun Chen"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Industrial park Wastewater treatment plant Industrial pollution prevention Water environmental protection Pollutant removal performance China", "Sumber": "Journal of Cleaner Production 214 (2019) 939e951", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Mar 2019"}
