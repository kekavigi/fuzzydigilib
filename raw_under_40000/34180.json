Chlorophyll a content of both microalgae\nin the first cycle was significantly higher than the second cycle. S. quadricauda removed 92.15% of total nitrogen,\n100% of phosphate, 100% of sulfate and 76.77% of total organic carbon, after two cycles of cultivation. The\ndominant fatty acids during the first and second cycle of S. quadricauda and T. suecica cultivation were C18:1 and\nC18:3n-3, respectively. The results suggest that by reusing DWW in two consecutive cycles of microalgal cultivation, higher pollutants removal efficiency and microalgal biomass production can be achieved.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ehsan Daneshvar [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mohammad Javad Zarrinmehr.,Eleni Koutra.,, Michael Kornaros.,Omidvar Farhadian., Amit Bhatnagar"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Microalgae Dairy wastewater (DWW) Wastewater treatment Mixotrophic cultivation Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) Wastewater reuse", "Sumber": "Bioresource Technology 273 (2019) 556\u2013564", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Feb 2019"}
