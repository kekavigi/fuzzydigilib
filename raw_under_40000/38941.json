{"Nomor": 38941, "Judul": "Operando Direct Observation of Charge Accumulation and the Correlation with Performance Deterioration in PTB7 Polymer Solar Cells", "Abstrak": "Polymer solar cells are one of the promising energy sources because\nof the easy solution-processable production with large area at a low cost without\ntoxicity. Among the polymer materials, a donor?acceptor conjugated copolymer\nPTB7 has been extensively studied because of the typical high-performance\npolymer solar cells. Here, we show operando direct observation of charge\naccumulation in PTB7:PC71BM blend solar cells from a microscopic viewpoint\nusing electron spin resonance spectroscopy. The accumulation of ambipolar\ncharges in the PTB7-based cells is directly observed for the first time, which shows\na clear correlation with the performance deterioration during device operation. The\nsites of the ambipolar charge accumulation are elucidated at the molecular level,\nwhose information would be useful for improving the cell durability in addition to\nthe performance improvement.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Takaya Kubodera 1.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170670"}, "Penulis": "Takaya Kubodera [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Masaki Yabusaki, Vanadian Astari Suci Atina Rachmat, Yujin Cho,Toshihiro Yamanari, Yuji Yoshida, Nobuhiko Kobayashi,? and Kazuhiro Marumoto"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": ": polymer solar cells, PTB7, electron spin resonance spectroscopy, charge accumulation, performance deterioration", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
