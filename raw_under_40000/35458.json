{"Nomor": 35458, "Judul": "Aesthetics as an Aspect of Good in Enderby Novels by Anthony Burgess", "Abstrak": "This article considers the interaction of ethics and aesthetics in A. Burgess's worldview. It is based on an analysis  of  the  novels  about  the  minor  poet  Enderby,  who  is  interpreted  as  the  writer's  alter  ego.  The  material  for  the  article  is  represented  by  the  novels  \"Inside  Mr.  Enderby\",  \"Enderby  outside\",  \"The  Clockwork  Testament,  or  Enderby's  End\",  \"Enderby's  Dark  Lady\",  or  \"No  End  of  Enderby\".  Particular  attention is paid to the personality of the protagonist and his worldview. In the course of the analysis, the superficial  interpretations  of  Enderby's  image  and  the  system  of  his  relationships  with  the  outside  world  are  rejected  in  favor  of  deeper  ones,  arising  from  the  system  of  the  author's  outlooks  on  creativity.  The  material  of  other  writer's  novels  is also  attracted  to  the  study  (\"A  Clockwork  Orange\",  \"The  Wanting  Seed\", \"Little Wilson and Big God\", etc), where his religious and ethical views are most clearly manifested. \nThe  analysis  of  Burgess's  search  for  faith,  his  path  from  congenital  Catholicism  through  Manichaeism  to  the development of his own religious and ethical picture of the world has been performed in this paper. It has shown that according to Burgess the Beauty is of primary value and the writer is seen as the creator of  such a world view where the original duality of reality can be overcome through the language.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "E.
