The  quintessential  French  movement  was  born  not  on  the  banks  of  the  Seine  but  on  the  banks  of  the  Thames.  In  September  1870,  Monet  moved  to  London  to  escape  conscription  during  the  Franco Prussian War, which had broken out in July. He  was  not  alone  and  joined  a  burgeoning  French  diaspora,  and  he  was  adopted  by  the landscapist Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Daubigny.
