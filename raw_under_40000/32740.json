{"Nomor": 32740, "Judul": "A highly efficient implicit finite difference scheme for acoustic wave propagation", "Abstrak": "The accuracy of a numerical derivative has a significant effect on any numerical simulation. Long\nstencils can provide high accuracy as well as reduce the numerical anisotropy error. However,\nsuch a long stencil demands extensive computational resources and with their growing size, such\nderivatives may become physically non-realistic since contributions from very far offset whereas\nthe derivative is local in nature. Further, the application of such long stencils at boundary points\nmay introduce errors. In this paper, we present a very efficient, accurate and compact size\nnumerical scheme for acoustic wave propagation using implicit finite difference operator, which\nutilizes a lesser number of points to estimate derivatives in comparison to the conventional central\ndifference derivative operator. The implicit derivative operator, despite its several advantages, is\ngenerally avoided due to its high computational cost. Therefore in this paper, we discuss a method\nwhich can dramatically reduce the computational cost of this scheme to almost half. This strategy\nis useful particularly for 2D and 3D case. Spectral characteristics of the derivative operator and the\nnumerical scheme are compared with several other central difference schemes. We have also\ndemonstrated an application of this scheme for seismic wave propagation in 2D and 3D acoustic\nmedia.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ajay Malkoti [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Nimisha Vedanti, Ram Krishan Tiwari"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Seismic, Acoustic, Wave propagation, Finite difference, 2D/3D modeling", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics, S0926-9851(18)30361-6  DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.12.017", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "03 Jan 2019"}
