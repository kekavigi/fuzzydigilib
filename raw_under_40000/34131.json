{"Nomor": 34131, "Judul": "Geography, Art Theory, and New Perspectives for an Inclusive Art History", "Abstrak": "For a long time now, many have considered art history to be\nin a state of crisis. In the last decade, numerous publications\nhave attempted to reimagine the discipline, addressing its\nfuture or even its supposed death.1 At the beginning of the\ntwentieth century, as art history was affirming itself as an\nestablished, autonomous field within the humanities, art\nitself was going through its own crisis. A profound dissatisfaction\nwith art and art institutions was prevalent, and many\nartists who looked for fresh ideas turned to non-European\ntraditions for inspiration. African masks, Japanese art, and\nindigenous artifacts all aroused the interest of Fauvists, Cubists,\nDadaists, and Surrealists. However, it is clear now that\nthese non-European traditions were not perceived in their\nown terms to produce what could have been a genuine artistic\nexchange. On the contrary, they were evoked in strictly\nEuropean terms, as a \u201cradical other,\u201d which, as opposed to\nWestern art, was imagined as innocent, strong, and connected\nto real life. Taking the frequent parallels between the\ndevelopments of art and art history evidenced by history, in\nmy opinion, we should be very cautious in the way we deal\nwith the present crisis of the discipline.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Claudia Mattos [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "art theory, art history, geography, perspektive", "Sumber": "Instituto de Artes, Departamento de Artes Plasticas, Rua Elis Regina 50, Cidade Universitaria Zeferino Vaz, 13083-854, Campinas, SP, Brazil", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Feb 2019"}
