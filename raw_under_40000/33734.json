{"Nomor": 33734, "Judul": "ORTHOGONAL LIQUID-JET IMPINGEMENT ON WETTABILITY-PATTERNED IMPERMEABLE SUBSTRATES", "Abstrak": "Liquid-jet impingement on flat impermeable substrates is important for a multitude of\napplications ranging from electronic-equipment cooling to fuel atomization and erosion\nof solid surfaces. On a wettable horizontal surface, where a sufficient downstream liquid\ndepth can be sustained after axisymmetric impingement, the jet forms a thin film on\nthe substrate up to a radial distance where the film height suddenly increases, forming\na hydraulic jump. On a superhydrophobic surface, where a downstream liquid depth is\nnot naturally sustained, the thin film expands and breaks up into droplets, which are\nsubsequently ejected in a random fashion outward, as carried by their radial momentum.\nIn the present work, a facile, scalable, wettability-patterning approach is presented for\ndelaying or even eliminating droplet breakup in the case of jet impingement on horizontal\nsuperhydrophobic surfaces. Analytical expressions for predicting the hydraulic jump and\ndroplet breakup locations are developed to designate the proper wettability patterns that\nfacilitate alteration and control of the postimpingement liquid behavior. The axisymmetric\nmodel is extended to evaluate the radial variation of the competing forces responsible for\nfilm breakup, and a design criterion for the effective wettability patterns is proposed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "UDDALOK SEN [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["SOUVICK CHATTERJEE,", "JULIE CROCKETT,", "RANJAN GANGULY,", "LISHA YU,", "AND CONSTANTINE M.
