As Matthew Heins\u2019 (2015)\npaper suggests, both New and Landscape Urbanists have imagined this as a\nterritorial battle over urban design, and one with enormous consequences.\nHowever, in reality this is not an either-or proposition; no hero from either side\nwill emerge victorious, because both movements have effectively played\nthemselves out. New paradigms for city-making are already supplanting them.\nThese new directions are where the field of urban design should set its sights, but\nto get there some tidying up is required. Much can still be learnt from the\nsuccesses and failures of the latest urbanisms so that what emerges is a paradigm\nthat supports both human and natural systems.
