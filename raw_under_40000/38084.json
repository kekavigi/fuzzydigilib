{"Nomor": 38084, "Judul": "Drop Coating Deposition Raman (DCDR) Spectroscopy  untuk Karakterisasi Senyawa Turunan Porfirin", "Abstrak": "Porphyrin is a heterocyclic macromolecules which has an important role in biological processes  of  living  things,  such  as  photosynthesis,  electron  transfer,  and  activation  of oxygen. Porphyrin has many applications such as photocatalyst, photodynamic therapy for cancer  treatment,  photosensitizer  in  solar  cells,  and  other  applications.  Due  to  many important  roles  of  porphyrin,  a  good  characterization  method  is  needed  to  identify  its structure   and   properties,   for   example   Raman   spectroscopy.   However,   in   Raman spectroscopy, fluoresence signal of porphyrin can interfere Raman signal. There are some techniques to increase the intensity of  Raman signals, such as Surface-Enhanced Resonance Raman Scattering (SERRS) and Drop Coating Deposition Raman (DCDR) spectroscopy. In this study, DCDR technique  was performed on a gold metal surface in tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) characterization. Here, optimum conditions was obtained by varying temperature, heating time, concentration, and type of substrate. We found that 40 minutes heating at\n100\u00b0C of substrate and 1\u00d710-4 M analyte give the highest signal. This optimum condition of\nmeasurement was applied to characterize tetra(3-methylphenyl)porphyrin, tetra(4- methylphenyl)porphyrin, tetra(3-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin,    and tetra(4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin. Then substrate effect on Raman signal analysis was carried out using TPP. We found that gold give the highest Raman intensity among the four studied substrate i.e. aluminium foil, tantalum plate, Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) glass, and gold.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Tika Pebriani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/167632", "PUSTAKA Tika Pebriani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/167639"}, "Penulis": "Tika Pebriani [10510052]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Veinardi Suendo, S.Si., M.Eng.", "Dr. Ciptati, MS, M.Sc."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "DCDR, gold, pophyrin, Raman Spectroscopy, SERRS.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "8 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Mei 2019"}
