The IGZO thin-film semiconductor was fabricated using a solution-based process ona doped-silicon wafer covered with silicon dioxide. In order to optimize the IPL irradiationcondition for the annealing process, theflash white light irradiation energy was varied from70 to 130 J/cm2. Drying by NIR and DUV irradiation was employed and optimized toimprove the performance of the TFT during IPL annealing. A TFT with a bottom-gate andtop-contact structure was formed by depositing an aluminum electrode on the source anddrain on the IPL-annealed IGZO. The electrical transfer characteristic of the TFT wasmeasured using a parameter analyzer. Thefield effect mobility of the saturation regime andon/offcurrent ratio were evaluated. Changes of the metal?oxide bonds in the IGZO thinfilm were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to verify the effect of NIR andDUV drying and IPL annealing. Also, the distributions of the carrier concentration on theIPL-annealed IGZO were measured through a hall-effect system to deeply investigate the transition of the electricalcharacteristic of the TFT. From the results, it was found that the bond between oxygen and the gallium compound was activatedvia DUV irradiation. The NIR- and DUV-assisted IPL-annealed IGZO-based TFT showed highly enhanced electricalperformance with a 7.7 cm2/V\u00b7s mobility and a 3\u00d7106on/offratio.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Chang-Jin_Moon_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164942"}, "Penulis": "Chang-Jin Moon [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hak-Sung Kim"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "IGZO semiconductor, intense pulsed light annealing, near-infrared, deep-UV, gallium oxide, mobility, on/offratio,thin-film transisto", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
