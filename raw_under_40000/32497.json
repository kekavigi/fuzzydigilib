{"Nomor": 32497, "Judul": "Experimental Study on the Blasting Performance of Water-Soil Composite Stemming in Underground Mines", "Abstrak": "Top stemming is necessary to stop the explosive energy from escaping through the upper part of blast-holes in cutting blasts of\nlarge-diameter deep-hole blasting in underground mines. -e often-used single soil stemming frequently leads to material\nclogging which results in reduction of blasting efficiency. In this paper, a new water-soil composite stemming is proposed to solve\nthe problem. A series of small-scale tests were conducted on solid concrete masonry blocks to investigate the effect of top\nstemming material and stemming length on blasting performance. -e experimental results indicated that water stemming was\nworse at improving the utilization rate of the explosion energy compared with single soil stemming of the same length. Further,\nthe mean fragment size decreased with the increase of stemming length for single water stemming. -ree schemes of water-soil\ncomposite stemming were designed and the scheme with soil in the lower part and water filled in bags in the higher part had the\nbest fragmentation. -e water-soil composite stemming was applied in underground stopes, and field results indicated that the\nnewly proposed stemming led to similar rock fragmentation with traditional single soil stemming, but greatly reduced the clogged\nblast hole ratio, thus effectively improving blasting and mining efficiency.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "XIANYANG QIU [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiuzhi Shi", "Shu Zhang", "Bo Liu", "and Jian Zhou"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Blasting", "Sumber": "Advances in Materials Science and Engineering Volume 2018, Article ID 3523509, 11 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/3523509", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
