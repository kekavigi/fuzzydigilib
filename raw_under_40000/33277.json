{"Nomor": 33277, "Judul": "Estimation of Resilient Modulus of Subgrade Soils Using Falling Weight Deflectometer", "Abstrak": "Field and laboratory testing programs were conducted to develop models that predict the resilient modulus (Mr) of subgrade soils from the falling weight deflectometer (FWD) test results. Mr is used in the design and evaluation of pavement structures. The field testing program included testing various sections in 10 pavement projects within Louisiana. The tested sections covered the common subgrade soil types found in Lousiana. Three backcalculation software packages were iused to interpret th FWD data: ELMOD 5.1.69, MODULUS 6.0, and EVERCALC 5.0. In addition, the AASHTO and Florida backcalculation equations were used for comparison. The laboratory testing program consisted of conducting repeated load triaxial Mr tests, physical properties, and compaction tests on soil samples obtained from tested sections. Statistical models were developed that can relate the laboratory measured Mr to FWD moduli backcalculated (EFWD) using each of the methods considered. The results of this study showed that the EFWD/Mr ratio ranged from 0.51 to 8.1 for the tested subgrade soils. Furthermore, this ratio was higher at lower Mr values and hence weaker subgrade soils. The EFWD/Mr ratio was also found to be significantly affected by the backcalculatio method. The results of the regression analysis showed that among all backcalculated FWD moduli, those backcalculated using ELMOD 5.1.69 software had the best correlation with Mr. Furthermore, for the results showed that the Mr prediction was significantly enhanced when soil properties were included as variables within the regression model", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Munir D.
