{"Nomor": 38983, "Judul": "Platelet Janus Particles with Hairy Polymer Shells for Multifunctional Materials", "Abstrak": "A novel approach is developed for the large-scale synthesis of Janus\nparticles with platelet geometry and dense polymer shells by employing simultaneous\n\u201cgrafting from\u201d of hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymers using surface-induced ATRP\nin emulsion. The method is based on the fabrication of an emulsion consisting of a\nwater solution of a hydrophilic monomer and a solution of a hydrophobic monomer in\nan organic solvent, which is stabilized by initiator-modified kaolinite particles. Two\npolymers are grafted simultaneously on the opposite faces of the kaolinite particle\nduring polymerization. The synthesized particles have a clear Janus character and are\nhighly efficient for the stabilization of emulsions. Because of its simplicity, the method\ncan readily be upscaled for the synthesis of large amounts of Janus particles, up to\nseveral grams", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Alina Kirillova 1.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170737"}, "Penulis": "Alina Kirillova [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Georgi Stoychev, Leonid Ionov, Klaus-Jochen Eichhorn, Mikhail Malanin, Alla Synytska"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "Janus particles, kaolinite, polymer shells, hybrid hairy particles, large-scale synthesis, emulsions, anti-icing coatings", "Sumber": "www.acsami.org  dx.doi.org/10.1021/am502973y | ACS Appl.
