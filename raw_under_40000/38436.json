{"Nomor": 38436, "Judul": "Fabrication of Metal Nanostructures on DNA Templates", "Abstrak": "Metal nanoarchitectures fabrication based on DNA\nassembly has attracted a good deal of attention. DNA nanotechnology\nenables precise organization of nanoscale objects with extraordinary\nstructural programmability. The spatial addressability of DNA\nnanostructures and sequence-dependent recognition allow functional\nelements to be precisely positioned; thus, novel functional materials\nthat are difficult to produce using conventional methods could be\nfabricated. This review focuses on the recent development of the\nfabrication strategies toward manipulating the shape and morphology\nof metal nanoparticles and nanoassemblies based on the rational\ndesign of DNA structures. DNA-mediated metallization, including\nDNA-templated conductive nanowire fabrication and sequenceselective metal deposition, etc., is briefly introduced. The modifications of metal nanoparticles (NPs) with DNA and\nsubsequent construction of heterogeneous metal nanoarchitectures are highlighted. Importantly, DNA-assembled dynamic\nmetal nanostructures that are responsive to different stimuli are also discussed as they allow the design of smart and dynamic\nmaterials. Meanwhile, the prospects and challenges of these shape-and morphology-controlled strategies are summarized.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Na Li 1.pdf\niu": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/169715"}, "Penulis": "Na Li [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yingxu", "ShangZihong", "HanTing", "WangZhen-Gang", "Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "DNA nanotechnology, metal nanostructures, self-assembly, nanofabrication, surface plasmonics", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
