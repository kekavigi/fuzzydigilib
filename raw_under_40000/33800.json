{"Nomor": 33800, "Judul": "Nanopore Structure Comparison Between Shale Oil And Shale Gas: Examples From The Bakken And Longmaxi Formations", "Abstrak": "In order to analyze and compare the differences in pore structures between shale gas and shale oil formations, a few\nsamples from the Longmaxi and Bakken Formations were collected and studied using X-ray diffraction, LECO TOC\nmeasurement, gas adsorption and field-emission scanning electron microscope. The results show that samples from the\nBakken Formation have a higher TOC than those from the Longmaxi Formation. The Longmaxi Formation has higher\nmicropore volume and larger micropore surface area and exhibited a smaller average distribution of microsize pores\ncompared to the Bakken Formation. Both formations have similar meso-macropore volume. The Longmaxi Formation has\na much larger meso-macropore surface area, which is corresponding to a smaller average meso-macropore size. CO2\nadsorption data processing shows that the pore size of the majority of the micropores in the samples from the Longmaxi\nFormation is less than 1 nm, while the pore size of the most of the micropores in the samples from the Bakken Formation is\nlarger than 1 nm. Both formations have the same number of pore clusters in the 2\u201320 nm range, but the Bakken Formation\nhas two additional pore size groups with mean pore size diameters larger than 20 nm. Multifractal analysis of pore size\ndistribution curves that was derived from gas adsorption indicates that the samples from the Longmaxi Formation have\nmore significant micropore heterogeneity and less meso-macropore heterogeneity. Abundant micropores as well as mesomacropores exist in the organic matter in the Longmaxi Formation, while the organic matter of the Bakken Formation hosts\nmainly micropores.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "KOUQI LIU  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Liang Wang", "Mehdi Ostadhassan", "Jie Zou", "Bailey Bubach", "Reza Rezaee"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Shale gas, Shale oil, Pore structure, Gas adsorption, Pore family, Multifractal analysis", "Sumber": "Petroleum Science (2019) 16:77\u201393 https://doi.org/10.1007/s12182-018-0277-3", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Jan 2019"}
