{"Nomor": 32388, "Judul": "Study of hydraulic fracture growth behavior in heterogeneous tight sandstone formations using CT scanning and acoustic emission monitoring", "Abstrak": "Tortuous hydraulic fractures (HFs) are likely to be created in heterogeneous formations such as conglomerates, which may\ncause sand plugging, ultimately resulting in poor stimulation efficiency. This study aims to explore HF growth behavior in\nconglomerate through laboratory fracturing experiments under true tri-axial stresses combined with computed tomography\nscanning and acoustic emission (AE) monitoring. The effects of gravel size, horizontal differential stress, and AE focal\nmechanisms were examined. Especially, the injection pressure and the AE response features during HF initiation and\npropagation in conglomerate were analyzed. Simple HFs with narrow microfractures are created in conglomerate when the\ngravels are considerably smaller than the specimen, whereas complex fractures are created when the gravels are similar in\nsize to the specimen, even under high horizontal differential stresses. Breakdown pressure and AE rates are high when a HF\nis initiated from the high-strength gravel. A large pressure decline after the breakdown may indicate the creation of a planar\nand wide HF. Analyzing the focal mechanism indicates that the shear mechanism generally dominates with an increase in\nthe HF complexity. Tensile events are likely to occur during HF initiation and are located around the wellbore. Shear\nevents occur mainly around the nonplanar and complex matrix/gravel interfaces.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Nai-Zhen Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yu-Shi Zou", "Xin-Fang Ma", "Ning Li", "Shan Wu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Conglomerate, Gravel, Hydraulic fracturing, Propagation mechanism, Computed tomography (CT), Acoustic emission (AE)", "Sumber": "Petroleum Science https://doi.org/10.1007/s12182-018-0290-6(0123456789().,-volV)(0123456789().,-volV)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
