{"Nomor": 37870, "Judul": "Exotic nuclear decay detected", "Abstrak": "For half a century, our view of the world has been based on the standard model of\nparticle physics. However, this view has been challenged by theories1\n that can overcome some of the limitations of the standard model. These theories allow neutrinos to be Majorana particles (that is, they are indistinguishable\nfrom their own antiparticles) and predict the existence of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) as the constituents of invisible \u2018dark matter\u2019 in the Universe. Majorana neutrinos mediate a type of nuclear decay called neutrinoless double-? decay, an example of which is neutrinoless double electron capture.\nA crucial step towards observing this decay is to detect its standard-model equivalent: two-neutrino double electron capture. On page 532, the XENON Collaboration2\n reports the first direct observation of this process in xenon-124 nuclei, using a detector that was built to detect WIMPs", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "JOUNI SUHONEN [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Astronomi", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Particle Physics", "Sumber": "462 | NATURE | VOL 568 | 25 APRIL 2019 NEWS & VIEWS \u00a9 2 0 1 9", "Staf Input/Edit": "pustaka bosscha", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Apr 2019"}
