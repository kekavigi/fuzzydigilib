{"Nomor": 32737, "Judul": "Does early training improve driving skills of young novice Frenchdrivers?", "Abstrak": "tThe aim of this research was to study drivers\u2019 performances and divided attention depending on their ini-tial training. The performances of young novice drivers who received early training, traditionally traineddrivers and more experienced drivers were compared during a dual task consisting of a simulated car-following task and a number\u2019 parity judgment task. It was expected that, due to their limited drivingexperience, the young novice drivers would have more difficulty in adequately distributing their attentionbetween the two tasks. Poorer performances by novice drivers than experienced drivers were thereforeexpected. The results indicate that traditionally trained drivers had more difficulties in speed regulationand maintaining their position in the lane than drivers with early training and experienced drivers. Perfor-mance impairment linked to driving inexperience was also found in the secondary task. The results wereinterpreted regarding the attentional resources involved in driving with a secondary task and supportedthe positive effects of French early training.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Chloe Freydier [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Catherine Berthelon, Mireille Bastien-Toniazzo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Divided, attention, Distraction, Novice,driver , Simulation, Driver training", "Sumber": "Science Direct", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "03 Jan 2019"}
