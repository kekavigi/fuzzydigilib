{"Nomor": 36909, "Judul": "A Comprehensive Review On Proppant Technologies", "Abstrak": "The main function of traditional proppants is to provide and maintain conductive fractures during\nwell production where proppants should meet closure stress requirement and show resistance to\ndiagenesis under downhole conditions. Many different proppants have been developed in the oil &\ngas industry, with various types, sizes, shapes, and applications. While most proppants are simply\nmade of silica or ceramics, advanced proppants like ultra-lightweight proppant is also desirable\nsince it reduces proppant settling and requires low viscosity fluids to transport. Additionally,\nmultifunctional proppants may be used as a crude way to detect hydraulic fracture geometry or as\nmatrices to slowly release downhole chemical additives, besides their basic function of maintaining\nconductive hydraulic fractures. Different from the conventional approach where proppant is\npumped downhole in frac fluids, a revolutionary way to generate in-situ spherical proppants has\nbeen reported recently. This paper presents a comprehensive review of over 100 papers published\nin the past several decades on the subject. The objectives of this review study are to provide an\noverview of current proppant technologies, including different types, compositions, and shapes of\nproppants, new technologies to pump and organize proppants downhole such as channel fracturing, and also in-situ proppant generation. Finally, the paper sheds light on the current challenges\nand emphasizes needs for new proppant development for unconventional resources.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Feng Liang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mohammed Sayed", "Ghaithan A.
