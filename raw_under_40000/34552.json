{"Nomor": 34552, "Judul": "Micro-Distribution And Mechanical Characteristics Analysis Of Remaining Oil", "Abstrak": "As the water drive reservoir enters extra high water cut stage (greater than 80%), remaining oil\ndistribution becomes increasingly dispersed. Research on micro residual oil in pore appears\nparticularly important for reservoir development at extra high water cut stage. Oil occurrence\ncharacteristics recognition helps to understand the distribution of remaining oil and the mechanical characteristics of oil is the guide for tapping the remaining oil. On the basis of pore scale oil\newater two phase flow experiments, micro distribution of remaining oil is divided into four\noccurrence states in accordance with oil features at different stage of water flooding, the flake of\nremaining oil, oil column, oil droplet and oil film. A quantitative characterization method of\nremaining oil occurrence states is established. By using micro numerical simulation method,\nchange rules of four occurrence states of remaining oil during the process of water displacement\nand the mechanical characteristics of different occurrence state of remaining oil are analyzed.\nResults show that the continuous oil phase gradually transforms to discontinuous phase and even\nto dispersed phases during the water flooding process. At extra high water cut stage, most of\nremaining oil are dispersed oil columns, oil droplets and oil films, which are the main target of\nremaining oil to be tapped. By changing water flow direction or increasing the displacement\npressure gradient, the surface adsorption force acting on oil columns are overcome, and then the oil\ncolumns begin to move and finally to be produced out. Oil droplets in pore-throat center are\nscoured and carried out by water as the increase of the injection volume, while the oil droplets in\nblind ends and the oil films are extracted out by adding chemicals to reduce the interfacial tension,\nso as to enhance oil recovery. For water flooding reservoir, the corresponding tapping measures for\nfour types of oil occurrence states brought forward have great meanings of improving reservoir\nrecovery at high water cut stage", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hongxia Sun [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yujie Zhao", "Jun Yao"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Pore scale, Remaining oil, Occurrence characteristics, Mechanical characteristics, Extra high water cut stage", "Sumber": "Petroleum, Volume 3, Issue 4, Pages 483-488 (December 2017)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Feb 2019"}
