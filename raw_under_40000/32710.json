{"Nomor": 32710, "Judul": "The height of fractured zones caused by strip Wongawilli mining in a shallow buried coal seam underlying a hard roof", "Abstrak": "The exact determination of the height of fractured\nzones in overlying sedimentary strata is important in\ncoal mining performed underneath water bodies and\nfor a safe production. To prevent the inrush of water\nand sand during strip Wongawilli mining, we studied\nthe height of fractured zones in shallow coal seams\nunderlying a hard roof. Based on the geological setting\nand mining conditions at the Zhaowu coal mine, the\nheight of the fractured zones in overlying strata was\nmeasured using the loss of drilling fluid method and\nby numerical simulation. The height of the fractured\nzones and its development characteristics during strip\nWongawilli mining in shallow buried coal seam underlying a hard roof were obtained. The results demonstrate that the disturbance of the overlying strata\nduring strip Wongawilli mining is reduced and the\nheight of the fractured zones is smaller relative to that\noccurring during critical mining. The height of fractured zones increases with mining width in a steppedfinger line, and it manifests stable in each stage, but\nturns into the next stage by sudden increase. The\nexisting method of calculation and the traditional\nempirical formula to obtain the height of the fractured\nzones are not suitable for strip Wongawilli mining.\nThe calculation should be based on the size of mining.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yi Tan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wenbing Guo", "Erhu Bai", "and Daming Yang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Fractured zone, hard roof, loses of drilling fluid, strip Wongawilli mining, subcritical mining", "Sumber": "CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 115, NO. 7", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Jan 2019"}
