{"Nomor": 34447, "Judul": "Firing up craft capital: the renaissance of craft and craft policy in the United Kingdom", "Abstrak": "Crafts have recently been experiencing a renaissance. This revitalization sees\ncraft increasingly recognised as a growing industrial sector with benefits linked\nto educational, cultural and economic development policy agendas. This paper\nengages with policy debates around the place of craft in the United Kingdom\nfrom 2010. Drawing on craft sector perspectives and UK government policy ini-\ntiatives it situates the disciplines and practices of craft within their institutional\nsupport networks, organizational contexts and draws attention to the role of\nindividuals in driving agendas. The paper focuses on the national facing crafts\ndevelopment organizations, the UK Crafts Council and the UK Heritage Crafts\nAssociation, alongside recent policy discussion emerging from the UK Depart-\nment for Business, Innovation and Skills. Recognizing that the legacies of past\npractice often inform contemporary agendas, the paper explores how the advo-\ncacy of craft in the recent past has shaped the place and positioning of craft in\ncontemporary UK politics.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Doreen Jakob  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Nicola J.
