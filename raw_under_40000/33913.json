{"Nomor": 33913, "Judul": "One-Pot Synthesis of Cross-Linked Polymer Networks as a Hydrophilic Super-Adsorbent for Efficient Recovery of Heparin", "Abstrak": "Heparin is a naturally occurring sulfated glycosaminoglycan polysaccharide often used as an anticoagulant agent.\nIn this work, a series of water swellable cross-linked polymer networks consisting of acrylamide (AAm) as a support, N,N?-\nmethylene bis(acrylamide) (BisAAm) as a cross-linker, and (3-acrylamidopropyl)-trimethylammonium chloride) (APTMAC)\nas a heparin adsorbent was synthesized in water at different ratios of AAm to APTMAC in one-pot. A two-step polymerization\nprocess was used to incorporate APTMAC as an adsorbent primarily on the surface of the preformed but still growing crosslinked AAm support (X-AAm). Heparin adsorption results showed that the sample with 15 mol % APTMAC incorporated into\nthe X-AAm core demonstrated efficiency as high as the 100% APTMAC resin, with a high adsorption capacity of 223.36 mg g?1\n,\nwhich makes it the sample of choice for industrial application and cost-effectiveness. The adsorption efficiency of the optimized\nsample, X-AAm-APTMAC-(85?15) (that contains 15 mol % APTMAC), was evaluated versus some of the operational\nvariables, including adsorbent dosage, initial heparin concentration, temperature, pH, and time as well as the stability and\nreusability of the resin, which showed satisfying performance in a wide range of operational parameters with suitable stability\nand reusability. Heparin was efficiently adsorbed by the X-AAm-APTMAC-(85?15) from a biological sample containing\nenzymatically digested heparin. The calculated bioactivity of heparin eluted from X-AAm-APTMAC-(85?15) beads and\nAmberlite FPA98 Cl, an industrially available adsorbent for heparin recovery, was 3430 and 2623 units, respectively. Therefore,\nthe eluted heparin that adsorbed from the biological mixture using synthesized resin complies with the requirement of the United States Pharmacopeia.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mojtaba Enayati [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hamed Eskandarloo.,and Alireza Abbaspourrad"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "heparin recovery, hydrophilic adsorbent, supported polymer network, porcine intestinal mucosa, anticoagulant potency", "Sumber": "ACS Applied Polymer Materials", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Jan 2019"}
