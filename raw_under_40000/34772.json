{"Nomor": 34772, "Judul": "Identification of proteinaceous binders in paintings:Atargeted proteomic approach for cultural heritage", "Abstrak": "Identification of proteins in paintings and polychrome objects is a challenge, which requires the development of tailored analytical approaches. In the present study, a targeted proteomics approach was developed for discriminating among the three most common proteinaceous materials used as paint binders, i.e. milk, egg, and animal glue. In this study a specific database of peptides was created based on tandem MS analyses of tryptic digests of several paint samples collected from a variety of art objects of different ages and conservation conditions. Specific peptide markers of each protein were then selected and monitored by LC-MSMS in Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) ion mode, together with their specific precursor ion-product ion transitions, as defined by their unique amino acid sequence. The developed method enabled a sensitive and reliable detection of the target peptides in a selection of case studies, leading to the unambiguous identification of the proteins used as paint binders. The method showed greatly increased sensitivity compared to currently available strategies.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Roberto Vinciguerra  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["AnnaIlliano, Addolorata De Chiaro, Andrea Carpentieri , AnnaLluveras-Tenorio  ,IlariaBonaduce ,Gennaro Marino,PieroPucci,Angela Amoresano , LeilaBirolo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) Proteomics Ancient proteins Cultural heritage Paintings LC-MSMS", "Sumber": "Microchemical Journal Volume 144 January 2019, Pages 319-328", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Feb 2019"}
