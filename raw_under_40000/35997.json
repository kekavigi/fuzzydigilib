{"Nomor": 35997, "Judul": "Improved characterisation and modelling of measurement errors in electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) surveys", "Abstrak": "Measurement errors can play a pivotal role in geophysical inversion. Most inverse models require users to prescribe\nor assume a statistical model of data errors before inversion. Wrongly prescribed errors can lead to\nover- or under-fitting of data; however, the derivation of models of data errors is often neglected. With the\nheightening interest in uncertainty estimation within hydrogeophysics, better characterisation and treatment\nof measurement errors is needed to provide improved image appraisal. Here we focus on the role of measurement\nerrors in electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). We have analysed two time-lapse ERT datasets: one contains\n96 sets of direct and reciprocal data collected from a surface ERT linewithin a 24 h timeframe; the other is a\ntwo-year-long cross-borehole survey at a UK nuclear site with 246 sets of over 50,000 measurements. Our study\nincludes the characterisation of the spatial and temporal behaviour of measurement errors using autocorrelation\nand correlation coefficient analysis.Wefind that, in addition to well-known proportionality effects, ERT measurements\ncan also be sensitive to the combination of electrodes used, i.e. errors may not be uncorrelated as often assumed.\nBased on these findings, we develop a newerror model that allows grouping based on electrode number\nin addition to fitting a linear model to transfer resistance. The new model explains the observed measurement\nerrors better and shows superior inversion results and uncertainty estimates in synthetic examples. It is robust,\nbecause it groups errors together based on the electrodes used to make the measurements. The new model can\nbe readily applied to the diagonal data weightingmatrixwidely used in common inversion methods, aswell as to\nthe data covariance matrix in a Bayesian inversion framework. We demonstrate its application using extensive\nERT monitoring datasets from the two aforementioned sites.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Chak-Hau Michael Tso [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Oliver Kuras, Paul B.Wilkinson, Sebastian Uhlemann, Jonathan E.
