Interaction between the sialoglycoparticulates and the EIV was investigated by real-time reversetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of theEIV genome captured on the particulates. The number ofEIV-specific genes detected by rRT-PCR on a nasal swab obtained from infected horses clearly increased when the sample wastreated with sialoglyco particulates. Our results show these novel sialoglyco particulates can be used as a highly sensitive tool fordetecting low levels of EIV that were previously undetectable in the early or late stage of infection.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Makoto_Ogata_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/161635"}, "Penulis": "Makoto Ogata, [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Takashi Yamanaka,Ami Koizumi,Mao Sakamoto,Rena Aita,Hiroyuki Endo,Takehiro Yachi,Noriko Yamauchi,Tadamune Otsubo,Kiyoshi Ikeda,Tatsuya Kato,Enoch Y.
