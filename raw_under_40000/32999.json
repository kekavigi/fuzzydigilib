{"Nomor": 32999, "Judul": "Combined interpretation of NMR, MICP, and SIP measurements on mud-dominated and grain-dominated carbonate rocks", "Abstrak": "Carbonate formations still present a challenging target with regard to reservoir characterization as they possess a\nwide range of pore types and sizes aswell as interconnected and isolated pore space. In this study a set of micritic\nand oomoldic carbonate samples was investigated with three measurement techniques (magnetic resonance\n(NMR), mercury intrusion (MICP), and spectral induced polarization (SIP, in a frequency range from 5mHz to\n100 Hz)) which provide information about a rock's pore space indirectly based on different physical principles.\nThe aims of the study were to combine these pieces of information to characterize the pore space of mud-dominated\nand grain-dominated carbonate rocks and to investigate potential correlations between pore space properties\nand SIP-derived parameters.\nPore body and pore throat size distributionswere derived fromNMR and MICP data, respectively, and interpreted\nin terms of dominant pore throat (rt) radius, pore body (rb) radius and the rb/rt ratio. For validation of the NMRderivedrb\ndistributions, scanning electron microscope images were used for the computation of image-derived\npore size distributions. The SIP datawere interpreted in terms of characteristic features for oomoldic and micritic\nsamples. Phase shift, real (??) and imaginary part (???) of complex conductivity, respectively, were fitted with\nCole-Cole models and the characteristic parameters relaxation time ?, chargeability m, and frequency dependence\nc were derived for each sample. Subsequently, these parameters were interpreted with regard to correlations\nwith rb,rt, and rb/rt and specific surface Spor.\nThe results indicate that grain-dominated carbonates possess comparatively large radii rb and rt and low Spor,\nwhich seems to go along with sharp phase peaks (i.e. high c values) and a lowabsolute phase level (and therefore\nlowchargeabilitym). The mud-dominated carbonates, in contrast, possess relatively small radii rb and rt and high\nSporwhich is obviously associatedwith broad phase peaks (i.e. lowc values) and a comparatively high phase level\nresulting in highmvalues. ?, in contrast,was found to decreasewith increasing ratio rb/rt and may therefore have\nsimilar values in both micritic and oomoldic samples. Consequently, the results of this study contribute to a better\nunderstanding of the petrophysical properties of carbonate rocks as a function of their pore space characteristics.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Edith M\u00fcller-Huber  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Frank B\u00f6rner, Jana H.
