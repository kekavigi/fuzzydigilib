{"Nomor": 38167, "Judul": "Affordable housing design with application of vernacular architecture in Kish Island, Iran", "Abstrak": "Purpose \u2013 Kish Island is one of the most attractive tourism destinations in Iran and it is becoming an\nincreasingly popular destination for tourism investment. Many people have recently migrated to the\nisland. Thus, one of the housing policies for the island is to maximize the efficiency of residential lands,\nparticularly in providing affordable housing for low-income people. The purpose of this study is to\ndevelop social, economical and architectural solutions for affordable housing design and overcome\nrelated problems using adapted vernacular solutions.\nDesign/methodology/approach \u2013 The methodology of this study involved identifying the\nresearch problem, followed by formatting the research framework, reviewing the comprehensive\nliterature and documenting the concepts of affordable housing and vernacular architecture. Therefore,\nan affordable house design methodology was used to develop vernacular architecture to minimize cost\nand environmental impacts, while maximizing the social acceptability in housing projects for\nlow-income earners in Kish Island. Section A in Mir Mohanna, which is the most important residential\ncentre for the low-income people, was used as the study area in this research.\nFindings \u2013 The results of this study clarified that the houses in Section A in Mir Mohanna did not\nmeet the criteria of affordable housing and people\u2019s needs. Hence, some suggestions for affordable\nhousing would certainly contribute towards formulating all these, including housing policy to be\nimplemented on Kish Island.\nOriginality/value \u2013 The current paper was an attempt to find strategies for guiding the appropriate\nprocess of developing affordable housing on the basis of vernacular architecture for the country and\nother similar places. It is hoped that the recommendations might increase more regulated housing\ndevelopment and housing policies on Kish Island.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ali Afshar [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wa\u2019el Alaghbari", "Elias Salleh and Azizah Salim"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Iran, Housing, Design, Architecture, Government policy, Affordable housing, Housing policy, Low-income, Vernacular architecture", "Sumber": "https://search.proquest.com/docview/923393645/fulltextPDF/994BF92E01CE4738PQ/16?accountid=31562", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Mei 2019"}
