{"Nomor": 38184, "Judul": "A SCiForest based semi-supervised learning method for the seismic interpretation of channel sand-body", "Abstrak": "Machine learning technology has been widely applied in the field of seismic interpretation. In most\ncases, machine learning assisted seismic interpretation is calibrated or constrained by wells.\nHowever, due to the limitation of drilling cost, sometimes there are only a few samples can be\nobtained from the well-points for a specific layer, which is insufficient to guarantee the\ngeneralization ability of supervised learning. In this article, we propose a novelty semi-supervised\nmethod by combining the unsupervised isolation forest with split-selection criterion (SCiForest)\nalgorithm and the supervised feature selection process together. The key of the proposed method is\nto be able to make full use of both the self-contained distribution information of multiple seismic\nattributes and the calibration information of limited well-points at the same time. To highlight the\nadvantages of the proposed method referred to conventional supervised and unsupervised\nmethods, we take the channel identification practice in the western Bohai Sea as a case study for\ncomparison. Further discussion confirms that the proposed method can improve the visibility of\nchannel effectively by fusing the relevant information in amplitude, frequency, and morphologica l\nattributes with limited calibration, which may provide a reliable alternative way for further\nmachine learning assisted seismic interpretation", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yile Ao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hongqi Li, Liping Zhu, Zhongguo Yang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "machine learning, semi-supervised learning, pattern recognition, isolation forest, seismic interpretation", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics, S0926-9851(18)30730-4, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2019.04.019", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Mei 2019"}
