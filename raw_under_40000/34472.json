{"Nomor": 34472, "Judul": "Unemployment insurance benefits and income smoothing", "Abstrak": "Labor unemployment insurance reduces unemployment concerns.

Using exogenous variations in unemployment insurance benefits,\nwe find evidence consistent with this argument. We also find that the link between unemployment\ninsurance benefits and income smoothing is stronger when there is higher\nunemployment risk and when the firm is likely to employ more low-wage workers, who\nfind unemployment insurance benefits especially useful.
