The project is conducted in the interdisciplinary research center\u201c Individual Development and Adaptive Education of Children at Risk\u201d(IDeA [http://www.idea-frankfurt.eu; accessed 7 June 2013]). Combining a socio-constructivist approachof mathematics education with a psychoanalytic theory of attachment, two foci of analysisare examined: the interactional reconstruction of working processes of creative children while they are confronted with mathematical problems in a cooperative learning situation\nand a psychoanalytically oriented reconstruction of the psychodynamic background of a\nmathematically creative child in its family. In this article, one case study is presented.\nTheoretical considerations that combine the psychoanalytic findings with the results of the\nsocio-constructivist analyses are presented. This combination offers an innovative and unique perspective on the mathematical creativity of young children in preschool, kinder-garten and primary school age", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "G\u00f6tz Krummheuer  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Marianne Leuzinger-Bohleber & Marion M\u00fcller-Kirchof & Melanie M\u00fcnz & Rose Vogel"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Mathematical creativity .
