{"Nomor": 35104, "Judul": "Efficiency and economic feasibility of forward osmosis in textile wastewater treatment", "Abstrak": "Implementing forward osmosis (FO) into textile wastewater treatment process can provide high value to\nan industry segment which is a large consumer of fresh water and one of the biggest polluters. In this\nstudy real textile wastewater was used as feed solution with 1M NaCl, 1M MgCl2, blue dye mixture, and\ngreen dye mixture as draw solution in FO. Pre-determined concentrations of green and blue dye mixtures\nbased on final desired concentrations (for further use in dyeing process), gave comparable water flux\nwith 1M NaCl and 1M MgCl2, however, slightly higher reverse salt flux values were obtained with dyes\ncompared to the inorganic salts. Long-term filtration followed by chemical cleaning of the FO membranes\ntested resulted in 100% flux recovery with negligible irreversible fouling. Membrane surface characterisation (zeta potential, contact angle, SEM and ATR-FTIR) confirmed efficient FO membrane cleaning and\ncomplete flux recovery. Rejection performance of the FO membranes for COD rejection was >94% with up\nto 55% water recovery. The rejection of TDS, TSS, Zn2\u00fe, and SO4\n2 were all >99%. Using the obtained\nresults an OPEX/CAPEX analysis demonstrated the economic feasibility of using the FO process in textile\nwastewater treatment system.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jasmina Korenak [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Claus Helix-Nielsen.,Hermina Buksek.,Irena Petrini"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Forward osmosis Biomimetic membranes Textile wastewater Draw solution", "Sumber": "Journal of Cleaner Production 210 (2019) 1483-1495", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Feb 2019"}
