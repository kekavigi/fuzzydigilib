The primary aim of this study was to investigate the relationships among the inconveniences that pedestrians perceive in city tra?c, the tra?c safety climate and pedestrian behavior. A total of 311 participants voluntarily and validly completed a survey that included the Pedestrian Inconvenience Questionnaire (PIQ), the Tra?c Climate Scale (TCS) and the Pedestrian Behavior Scale (PBS). We discovered that pedestrians\u2019 perceived inconvenience was positively correlated with transgression and positive behavior by pedestrians and it also positively correlated with the external a?ective demands (emotional engagement facet of TCS) while negatively correlated with the functionality (functional tra?c system facet of TCS). We determined that the external a?ective demands were positively correlated with pedestrian risk behaviors (i.e., transgression, aggressive behaviors and lapses), internal requirements (tra?c participants\u2019 skills facet of TCS) were positively correlated with positive behaviors, and functionality was negatively correlated with transgression and lapses. Moreover, the results indicate that the relationship between the inconveniences pedestrians perceive in city tra?c and pedestrians\u2019 transgressive behavior was fully mediated by the functionality dimension of the tra?c safety climate. Pedestrians\u2019 perceived inconvenience is an important factor that a?ects pedestrian behavior, and the in?uence of pedestrians\u2019 perceptions of the tra?c safety climate cannot be disregarded.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "JING XU [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yan Gea.", "Weina Qua.", "Xianghong Suna.", "Kan Zhanga"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Traffic safety climate, Pedestrian behavior, Pedestrian inconvenience", "Sumber": "Accident Analysis and Prevention 119 (2018) 155\u2013161", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yoninur Almira \u00a0\n                                     Yoninur Almira", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
