{"Nomor": 37511, "Judul": "Deuteron charge radius from the Lamb-shift measurement in muonic deuterium", "Abstrak": "The deuteron charge radius is calculated from the measurement of the Lamb shift in muonic deuterium,\ntaking into account the electron vacuum polarization correction to the nuclear-structure effects. This correction is unexpectedly large and gives a mean-square charge-radii difference r2 d ? r2p = 3.81747(346) fm2, which is now consistent with that obtained from the ordinary H-D isotope shift in the 1S-2S transition. This suggests that the long-standing discrepancy in the proton charge radius obtained from electronic and muonic systems is due to an underestimated uncertainty in ordinary hydrogen spectroscopy.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Marcin Kalinowski [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW A 99, 030501(R) (2019); \u00a92019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Mar 2019"}
