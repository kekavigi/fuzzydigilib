{"Nomor": 35733, "Judul": "Assessment of spatial distrilbution of porosity and aquifer geohydraulic parameters in parts of the Tertiary \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd Quaternary hydrogeoresource of south-eastern Nigeria", "Abstrak": "An integrated attempt exploring information deduced from extensive surface resistivity study in three\nLocal Government Areas of Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria and data from hydrogeological sources obtained\nfrom water boreholes have been explored to economically estimate porosity and coefficient of permeability/\nhydraulic conductivity in parts of the clastic Tertiary \u2013 Quaternary sediments of the Niger Delta\nregion. Generally, these parameters are predominantly estimated from empirical analysis of core samples\nand pumping test data generated from boreholes in the laboratory. However, this analysis is not only\ncostly and time consuming, but also limited in areal coverage. The chosen technique employs surface\nresistivity data, core samples and pumping test data in order to estimate porosity and aquifer hydraulic\nparameters (transverse resistance, hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity). In correlating the two sets\nof results, Porosity and hydraulic conductivity were observed to be more elevated near the riverbanks.\nEmpirical models utilising Archie\u2019s, Waxman-Smits and Kozeny-Carman Bear relations were employed\ncharacterising the formation parameters with wonderfully deduced good fits. The effect of surface conduction\noccasioned by clay usually disregarded or ignored in Archie\u2019s model was estimated to be 2.58\n 105 Siemens. This conductance can be used as a corrective factor to the conduction values obtained\nfrom Archie\u2019s equation. Interpretation aided measures such as graphs, mathematical models and maps\nwhich geared towards realistic conclusions and interrelationship between the porosity and other aquifer\nparameters were generated. The values of the hydraulic conductivity estimated from Waxman-Smits\nmodel was approximately 9.6  105m/s everywhere. This revelation indicates that there is no pronounced\nchange in the quality of the saturating fluid and the geological formations that serve as aquifers\neven though the porosities were varying. The deciphered parameter relations can be used to estimate\ngeohydraulic parameters in other locations with little or no borehole data.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "N.J.
