{"Nomor": 33014, "Judul": "A Methodology To Improve Nanosilica Based Cements Used In CO2 Sequestration Sites", "Abstrak": "Attempts to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in recent years have\nled to the development of Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) technology. However, there have been\nmany studies reporting leakages form CO2 storage sites as a result of cement degradation induced by\ngeneration of an acidic environment in the storage site. Although there are a number of approaches\nproposed to enhance the efficiency of the cement, the degradation issue has not been totally resolved yet\nperhaps due to the excessive corrosives nature of carbonic acid and supercritical CO2. The aim of this\nstudy is to propose a methodology to improve the physical and mechanical characteristics of the cement\nby nanomodification such that a consistent rheology, constant density and a good strength development\ncan be achieved. A new dispersion technique was proposed to ensure that the cement formulation gives\na consistent result. The results obtained indicated that unlike the literature mixing, cement slurries\nprepared by the new mixing technique are very consistent in their rheology, regardless of the sonication\nparameters chosen. The measurements of the compressive strength performed at the reservoir condition\nrevealed that nanosilica contributes in the strength development up to a certain point. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) conducted at the last stage indicated that the amount of Portlandite left in the\ncement by adding nanosilica is decreased due to the pozzolanic reaction, which would help the cement\nto have a higher chance of survival in a storage site. However, cautions must be taken to maintain a\ncertain amount of Portlandite in the cement for slowing down the carbonation rate, as otherwise the\nmatrix of the cement is attacked directly and the cement will be degraded very fast", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "KHIZAR ABID [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Raoof Gholami, Henry Elochukwu, Masood Mostofi, Chua Han Bing, Golam Muktadir"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Nanosilica, Dispersion method, Class G cement, Rheology, Compressive strength", "Sumber": "Petroleum 4 (2018) 198-208 - KeAi, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2017.10.005", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Jan 2019"}
