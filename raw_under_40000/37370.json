{"Nomor": 37370, "Judul": "Synthesis and Preliminary Evaluations of a Triazole-Cored Antagonist as a PET Imaging Probe ([18F]N2B-0518) for GluN2B Subunit in the Brain", "Abstrak": "GluN2B is the most studied subunit of Nmethyl-\nD-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and implicated in\nthe pathologies of various central nervous system disorders\nand neurodegenerative diseases. As pan NMDAR antagonists\noften produce debilitating side effects, new approaches in drug\ndiscovery have shifted to subtype-selective NMDAR modulators,\nespecially GluN2B-selective antagonists. While positron\nemission tomography (PET) studies of GluN2B-selective\nNMDARs in the living brain would enable target engagement\nin drug development and improve our understanding in the...", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hualong Fu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Weiting Tang, Zhen Chen, Vasily V.
