{"Nomor": 34267, "Judul": "Effects Of Inhibitor KCL On Shale Expansibility And Mechanical Properties", "Abstrak": "The expansibility and mechanical properties of shale are significantly influenced by water-based muds (WBMs);\nthus, it is necessary to mitigate this effect to avoid borehole instabilities in drilling operation. Potassium chloride\n(KCl) is usually used as inhibitor to reduce hydration of shales. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory\nefficiency of KCl on shale through a series of experiments, including dynamic linear swelling (DLS) tests and\nuniaxial compressive strength (UCS) tests, to provide reference for the design of WBMs. These tests were conducted on shale samples soaked in KCl solution for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h with saline concentrations of 0%, 2%,\n4%, 6%, and 8%. Experimental results show that samples with microcracks and bedding fissures have the highest\nswelling increase and the largest strength reduction after immersion in solution. The swelling potential decreased with increasing KCl concentration. In addition, KCl exhibited a certain inhibitory effect on the weakening of the mechanical properties of samples. An increase in the KCl concentration increases the compressive\nstrength and elastic modulus, and decreases the Poisson's ratio. However, in terms of homogeneous samples, the\nUCS test results show that exposure to water is weakly related to weakening of the mechanical properties of shale\nsamples. We found that immersing the shale in KCl solution for a longer time decreases the compressive strength,\nincreases the Poisson's ratio, and decreases the elastic modulus.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "XIANGCHAO SHI  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Lei Wang", "Jianhua Guo", "Qiang Su", "Xiao Zhuo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "KCl, Inhibitor, Expansibility, Mechanical properties, Bedding fissures", "Sumber": "Petroleum - KeAi, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.12.005", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Feb 2019"}
