{"Nomor": 33007, "Judul": "Identification of personal traits in adaptive learning environment: Systematic literature review", "Abstrak": "An adaptive learning environment provides personalised information to the learner through selfdirected study. An adaptive learning environment model can be subdivided into a learner model,\ndomain model, instructional model and adaptive engine. Personal traits comprise part of the\ncomponents in a learner model and can be identified either explicitly or implicitly in an adaptive\nlearning environment. In such an environment, the e-learning system should adapt to a learner's\nneeds. However, even though academic research on adaptive learning environments has increased, the field lacks a comprehensive literature analysis of learners' personal traits in these\nenvironments. This study conducts a systematic literature review to identify the most commonly\nused personal traits in modelling the learner and the existing techniques suitable for identifying\npersonal traits in an adaptive learning environment. A total of 140 articles spanning the years\n2010\u20132017 are initially reviewed, from which 78 are selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria relevant to this study. This study provides an overview of learners' personal traits\nand the techniques used to identify them to provide a basis for improving adaptive learning\nenvironments. The findings indicate that most of the previous works used a learning style from\nthe cognition learning domain category to model individual personal traits, while the computerbased detection technique was commonly applied to identify a learner's personal traits in\nadaptive learning environments. This study reveals the common learner characteristics used to\ndevelop learner models and the techniques for implementing such models. The findings of this\npaper can guide other researchers to recognise various personal traits and the identification\ntechnique for further studies, as well as assist developers in the development of the adaptive learning system.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Nur Baiti Afini Normadhi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Liyana Shuib.,, Hairul Nizam Md Nasir.,Andrew Bimba.,Norisma Idris.,Vimala Balakrishnan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Cooperative/collaborative learning Intelligent tutoring systems Interactive learning environments Navigation", "Sumber": "Computers & Education 130 (2019) 168\u2013190", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Jan 2019"}
