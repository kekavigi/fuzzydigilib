{"Nomor": 32824, "Judul": "A thermal model for predicting the drilling temperature in deep lunar regolith exploration", "Abstrak": "Lunar drilling will work in an extreme environment and may lead to a high drilling temperature due to\nthe poor heat dissipation approaches, with potentially devastating effects on the drill tool. This paper presents\na mathematical thermal model for predicting the drilling temperature in lunar regolith exploration.\nThe proposed model combines a unique heat balance equation for the system of the drill tool and the\ndrilled cuttings. Modeling of the drill tool-cuttings system assumes an axial temperature distribution\nalong the drill tool and one-dimensional transient heat transfer problem in a semi-infinite plane is\nemployed to calculate the temperature. Geometric features of the drill tool, thermal and mechanical\nproperties of the drill tool and lunar regolith, drilling parameters, and penetration force are taken into\nconsideration in the model. The theoretical investigation addresses the significance of heat generation\nby the penetration force and heat dissipation by the drilled cuttings. Convolution is utilized to establish\nthe heat transfer processes along the drill tool. Using the presented thermal model, a thermal property\ntest bed was employed to simulate drilling in an evacuated lunar environment, and experimental and\ncomputational temperatures were compared in penetrating a lunar regolith simulant with different drilling\nparameters. Experimental results indicated that the theoretical model was effective in predicting the\ndrilling temperature in sampling the lunar regolith simulant.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Tao Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xilun Ding"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Lunar exploration, Drill bit, Temperature prediction, Heat transfer, Lunar soil simulant", "Sumber": "Science Direct", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Jan 2019"}
