{"Nomor": 35409, "Judul": "A new cavability assessment for Longwall Top Coal Caving from discontinuum numerical analysis", "Abstrak": "This paper presents a new criterion for assessing top coal cavability in Longwall Top Coal Caving mining\ntechnology. Top coal Cavability Index (TCI) criterion was developed through a parametric study, statistical\nanalysis and validation against field monitoring data. A discontinuum modelling technique with plastic rock\nmaterial was used to quantify the impact of parameters on top coal cavability in a more realistic manner. The\nstudy demonstrated that an increase in the value of parameters such as immediate rock strength, coal strength,\ncoal elastic modulus, coal vertical joint spacing, coal discontinuity friction angle and top coal thickness causes a\ndecrease in top coal cavability, whereas an increase in the value of cover depth leads to an increase in the\ncavability. Coal elastic modulus was found to have a minor impact, while coal vertical joint spacing has the most\nsignificant impact on the cavability. The TCI criterion successfully incorporates the impacts of coal strength, rock\nstrength and discontinuity friction angle into the evaluation of top coal cavability. The proposed criterion can\nthus be utilised to explicitly assess top coal cavability taking into account coal seam characteristics, surrounding\nrock mass properties and the nature of discontinuities, which contributes to improving reliability of the criterion.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Tien Dung Le [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Chengguo Zhang, Joung Oh, Rudrajit Mitra, Bruce Hebblewhite"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Longwall Top Coal Caving, Cavability assessment, Discontinuum modelling, Top Coal Cavability Index", "Sumber": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrmms.2019.01.006", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Feb 2019"}
