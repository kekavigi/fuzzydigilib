{"Nomor": 32433, "Judul": "Exploring factors that improve mathematics achievement in Brunei", "Abstrak": "The low pass rate in Brunei Year 13 mathematics is a source of concern for many stakeholders. Success in\nmathematics is required for students wishing to attend university and pursue courses in the sciences and\ntechnology. Many different factors contribute to success and failure in mathematics. This field survey (N=330\nrandomly selected Year 13 students representing 179 females and 151 males) determined the extent to which\ncoping mechanisms, study strategies, learning styles, and self-efficacy were related to academic achievement in\nmathematics. Stepwise multiple regression analysis with backward elimination identified six statistically significant\nmain effect variables with links to mathematics achievement (task-oriented coping, textbook reading,\nconcentration, self-efficacy, time management, and activist learning style). Two-way interactions of the male\nand female genders with deep processing and reflector learning styles were also significantly associated with\nmathematics achievement. Other significant interaction variables were beneficial to both genders.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lawrence Mundia [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Halimaturradiah Metussin"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Matematika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Natural sciences & mathematics", "Kata Kunci": "Coping mechanisms, Study strategies, Learning styles, Self-efficacy, Mathematics achievement, Brunei", "Sumber": "Studies in Educational Evaluation xxx (xxxx) xxx\u2013xxx", "Staf Input/Edit": "Dwi Ary Fuziastuti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
