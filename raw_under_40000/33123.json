{"Nomor": 33123, "Judul": "The improved residual node density based gravity forward method and its application", "Abstrak": "Gravity forward modeling of the geological model is a necessary part in the investigation of subsurface density\nstructures, and is extremely valuable in developing and testing gravity data processing and inversion algorithms.\nIn dealingwith practical problems, the traditional block model based gravity forward procedure is time consuming,\nand cannot accurately forward the semi-infinite extended model. To deal with these problems, we proposed\nan improved residual node densitymodel based gravity forwardmethod. In this method,we firstly transform the\ndensity model into a residual node density model with a specific boundary condition; and then remove all the\nzero residual node density points; and then calculate the gravity anomalywith these non-zero residual node density\npoints.We implement the proposedmethod in both 2Dand 3D caseswith Fortran language, and then applied\nit to Marmousi2 (2D) and SEG/EAGE saltmodel (3D) gravity forwardmodeling. The result demonstrates that this\nmethod is efficient and has advantage in forward semi-infinite extended modelwith absolute density by providing\na specific boundary condition.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zhang Sheng  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Meng Xiaohong, Zhang Minghua, Chen Zhaoxi, Xiu Chunxiao, Liu Yajie"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Residual node density Gravity Gravity gradient Forward modeling Fortran", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 159 (2018) 765\u2013772, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.10.020", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Jan 2019"}
