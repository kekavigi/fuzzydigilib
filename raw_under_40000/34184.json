{"Nomor": 34184, "Judul": "Coupling of electrocoagulation and ozone treatment for textile wastewater reuse", "Abstrak": "Industrial textile wastewater is usually characterized by high pH, intense color and extremely high salinity,\nespecially in case of wastewater generated after dyeing. Due to the complex matrix of textile wastewater, the\nselection of an appropriate treatment method can be a challenge. This paper presents the advantages of coupling\nelectrocoagulation (EC) and ozonation (O3) as one-step (EC + O3) and two-step (EC ? O3) operations. The\ncombination of EC and O3, which both worked well in salty environment, gave very good results in the case of\naqueous solutions and real industrial wastewater containing Reactive Black 5 (RB5). Very high color removal,\nmore than 95%, was achieved in a very short treatment time (less than 18 min, while ca. 60 min was required in\nthe case of individual O3). At the same time the applied ozone dose was reduced from 1.69 g/L, when using O3\nonly, to less than 0.3 g/L for EC ? O3. The results of color removal and mineralization analysis indicated the\nhigh efficiency of both the EC + O3 and EC ? O3 processes; however, the cost evaluation revealed that the EC ?\nO3 treatment was more advantageous. EC preformed as a single treatment resulted in an increase in toxicity, but\ncoupling EC with O3 reduced this undesirable effect. Very promising results were obtained in recycling trials.\nThe color difference (DEcmc, according to ISO 105-J03) of textiles dyed with purified wastewater (brine) were\nbetween 0.28 and 0.98 (below the limiting value of 1.5).", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lucyna Bili?ska [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Kazimierz Blus.,Marta Gmurek.,Stanis?aw Ledakowicz"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Textile wastewater Electrocoagulation Ozonation Brine recycling Toxicity", "Sumber": "Chemical Engineering Journal 358 (2019) 992\u20131001", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Feb 2019"}
