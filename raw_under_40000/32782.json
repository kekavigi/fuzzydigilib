A questionnaire presented with a\nscenario that pedestrians crossed the road violating the pedestrian lights at an intersection was designed,\nand the survey was conducted in Dalian, China. Based on the 260 complete and valid responses, reliability\nand validity of the data for each question was evaluated. The data were then analyzed by using the\nstructural equation modeling (SEM). The results showed that people had a negative attitude toward the\nbehavior of violating road-crossing rules; they perceived social influences from their family and friends;\nand they believed that this kind of risky behavior would potentially harm them in a traffic accident. The\nresults also showed that instrumental attitude and subjective norm were significant in the basic TPB\nmodel. After adding descriptive norm, subjective norm was no more significant. Other models showed\nthat conformity tendency was a strong predictor, indicating that the presence of other pedestrians would\ninfluence behavioral intention. The findings could help to design more effective interventions and safety\ncampaigns, such as changing people\u2019s attitude toward this violation behavior, correcting the social norms,\nincreasing their safety awareness, etc. in order to reduce pedestrians\u2019 road crossing violations.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hongmei Zhou [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Stephanie Ballon Romero, Xiao Qin"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Pedestrian, Violating road-crossing behavior, Theory of planned behavior, Traffic safety", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "03 Jan 2019"}
