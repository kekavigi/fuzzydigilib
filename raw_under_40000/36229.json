{"Nomor": 36229, "Judul": "Self-Steerable Propulsion of Disk-Like Micro-Craft with Dual Off-Center Nanoengines", "Abstrak": "This paper reports a novel disk-like micro-craft with dual off-centernozzle nanoengines, consisting of three different metals: gold, nickel, and platinum. Abubble propulsion mechanism originating from momentum change induced by thedetachment of oxygen bubbles is proposed to elaborate the self-steerable propulsionof the disk-like gold?nickel?platinum micro-craft. The as-proposed micro-craft isfabricated by a layer-by-layer deposition method based on the micro-electro-mechanical systems technology. Herein, the self-steerable propulsion of thefabricated micro-craft dispersed in deionized water with different hydrogen peroxideconcentrations is characterized. As a consequence, the speed of the micro-craft isincreased with the increment of hydrogen peroxide concentration. In addition, themicro-craft can always move forward linearly.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Liangxing_Hu_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/161829"}, "Penulis": "Liangxing Hu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Kai Tao,Yu Dian Lim,Jianmin Miao,Young Jin Kim"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "self-steerable propulsion, disk-like micro-craft, dual off-center nanoengines, layer-by-layer, oxygen bubbles,hydrogen peroxide", "Sumber": "ACSAppl.EnergyMater.XXXX, XXX, XXX?XXX", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Mar 2019"}
