{"Nomor": 37372, "Judul": "Anticancer Drug Tamoxifen Affects Catecholamine Transmitter Release and Storage from Single Cells", "Abstrak": "Electrochemical measurements of exocytosis\ncombined with intracellular vesicle impact electrochemical\ncytometry have been used to evaluate the effect of an\nanticancer drug, tamoxifen, on catecholamine release at the\nsingle-cell level. Tamoxifen has been used for over 40 years to\ntreat estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers during both\nearly stages of the disease and in the adjuvant setting.\nTamoxifen causes memory and cognitive dysfunction, but the\nreasons for the cognitive impairment and memory problems\ninduced by this anticancer drug are not well-known....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zahra Taleat [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Anna Larsson, and Andrew G.
