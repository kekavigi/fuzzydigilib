{"Nomor": 36465, "Judul": "Structural, electronic, and optical properties of ?-Te tubular nanostructures: A first-principles study", "Abstrak": "We employed density functional theory to investigate the structural, electronic, and optical properties of ?-Te tubular nanostructures. These ?-Te tube-like structures, which are similar to carbon nanotubes in terms of their armchair and zigzag structures, are semiconductors with moderate bandgaps. The nanotubes in armchair configurations have an indirect-to-direct bandgap transition as tube diameter is decreased to a specific critical tube size, while those in zigzag configurations are always semiconductors with a direct gap independent of tube diameter. The calculated projected density of states reveals that such an indirect-to-direct bandgap transition found in armchair nanotubes can be attributed to the contributions of the different p-orbitals near the valence band maximum edges. The optical absorption spectra of ?-Te nanotubes are found to be anisotropic and vary with the tube diameters. These findings are not only helpful for better understanding the physical characteristics of ?-Te nanotubes but also opening up new possibilities for use in device applications.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yanrong Guo, [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Songyou Wang,", "Yu Jia,", "and Wan-Sheng Su"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "APL Mater. 7, 031105 (2019); doi: 10.1063/1.5087441", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari \u00a0\n                                     Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Mar 2019"}
