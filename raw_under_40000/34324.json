{"Nomor": 34324, "Judul": "Putting Disability Studies  to Work in Art Education", "Abstrak": "Putting disability studies to work in art education suggests a form of action or industry, a crea\ntive  opportunity  for  something  to  be  done,  recognising the relationship between theory \nand practice. Drawing on discourse analysis, this article offers an initial theoretical discussion \nof  some  of  the  ways  in  which  disability  is  revealed and created through discourses about \nart education in articles published over the last 30 years in iJADE. This article proposes that the \nlens of critical social pedagogies applied to work relating to gender, race and class should be \nextended to disability in order to promote critical engagement through art education rather than \ncritical avoidance. Drawing on Elliot Eisner\u2019s six lessons in what can be learnt from the arts, the \narticle concludes by recognising the importance of art education as a means of epistemic valida\ntion, where different ways of being in the world are valued. Art education and arts practice offer \na means of valuing and expressing the \u2018dynamic difference of what it means to be human\u2019. The \narticle argues that the combination of disability studies and art education can, therefore, be a \nforce to be reckoned with", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Claire Penketh [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "disability, disability arts, Eisner, art education,  disability studies", "Sumber": "THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION, 2014", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Feb 2019"}
