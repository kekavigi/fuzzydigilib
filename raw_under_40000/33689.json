{"Nomor": 33689, "Judul": "Geochemistry and origin of Ordovician oils in the Rewapu Block of the Halahatang Oilfield (NW China)", "Abstrak": "The oils in the Rewapu Block of the Halahatang Oilfield in the Tarim Basin (northwestern China) were geochemically\nanalyzed by gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry to investigate their origin and possible secondary alteration. The\nphysical properties and chemical compositions of these Ordovician oils vary greatly, ranging from light to extremely heavy\noils. All these oils belong to one single population and were derived from same source kitchen/bed. The differences in their\nchemical compositions and physical properties mainly result from secondary alteration of oils that were charged during the\nearly phase of trap formation. The thickness of Upper Ordovician and Silurian caprocks of oil reservoirs in the Rewapu\nBlock is higher than that in the north part of the Halahatang region, and therefore, significant biodegradation process is\nprevented. Compared to heavy oils in the north part, the Rewapu oils are dominated by light oils with no 25-norhopanes\nand no GC\u2013MS \u2018\u2018hump\u2019\u2019 (UCM: unresolved complex mixture) on the chromatographic baselines. The heavy oils in Wells\nRP7 and RP101C were primarily influenced by water washing since apparent reduction of alkylated dibenzothiophenes was\nobserved. The local geological background favored the water washing alteration. The reservoir geochemical study has\npractical application in hydrocarbon exploration and predicts the nature of oils in this oilfield.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "YOU-JUN TANG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mei-Jun Li", "Rong-Hui Fang", "Bao-Shou Zhang", "Zhe Yang", "Da-Xiang He", "Meng-Ru Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Biodegradation, Water washing, Oil charging process, Ordovician, Tarim Basin", "Sumber": "Petroleum Science (2019) 16:1\u201313 https://doi.org/10.1007/s12182-018-0284-4", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Jan 2019"}
