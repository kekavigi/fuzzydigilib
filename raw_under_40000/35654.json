{"Nomor": 35654, "Judul": "Forecasting the peak of the present solar activity cycle 24", "Abstrak": "Solar forecasting of the level of sun Activity is very important subject for all space programs. Most predictions\nare based on the physical conditions prevailing at or before the solar cycle minimum preceding the maximum in\nquestion. Our aim is to predict the maximum peak of cycle 24 using precursor techniques in particular those\nusing spotless event, geomagnetic aamin. index and solar flux F10.7. Also prediction of exact date of the maximum\n(Tr) is taken in consideration. A study of variation over previous spotless event for cycles 7\u201323 and that for\neven cycles (8\u201322) are carried out for the prediction. Linear correlation between maximum of solar cycles (RM)\nand spotless event around the preceding minimum gives R24t=88.4 with rise time Tr=4.6 years. For the even\ncycles R24E=77.9 with rise time Tr=4.5 y\u2019s. Based on the average aamin. index for cycles (12\u201323), we estimate\nthe expected amplitude for cycle 24 to be Raamin=99.4 and 98.1 with time rise of Traamin=4.04 & 4.3 years for\nboth the total and even cycles in consecutive. The application of the data of solar flux F10.7 which cover only\ncycles (19\u201323) was taken in consideration and gives predicted maximum amplitude R24 10.7=126 with rise time\nTr107=3.7 years, which are over estimation. Our result indicating to somewhat weaker of cycle 24 as compared\nto cycles 21\u201323.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "R.H.
