{"Nomor": 34106, "Judul": "THE REALITY OF DESIGNING APPROPRIATE \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdLOW COST\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd MEDICAL PRODUCTS FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND THEIR UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES", "Abstrak": "There are many organisations currently engaged in the\ndevelopment of \u2018low cost\u2019 medical equipment \u2018designed\u2019 for\ndeveloping countries. These organisations include NGOs,\nacademic institutions, not for profit organisations, charities,\nfoundations and spinout companies using funds from the not\nfor profit, charity sector to pump prime commercial\ncompanies. This paper will discuss the implications from the\nethical, safety and cost effective perspectives of these\nactivities.\nThe paper is intended to be provocative, not to pass\njudgement on these activities but because the authors believe\nthat important issues are being overlooked. However, it\nappears that there are a number of misleading activities under\nthis heading that are resulting in the less than optimal use of\navailable funding and in the displacement of existing relevant\ncommercial activities. This has led to a situation where\ninappropriate medical devices are being sent to resource poor\nareas of the world.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "R Neighbour [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["R Eltringham"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Low-cost, medical devices, low-income countries", "Sumber": "Managing Director, Diamedica UK Ltd, United Kingdom.
