{"Nomor": 37490, "Judul": "Is landscape architecture?", "Abstrak": "By virtue of their multiple and reciprocal temporalities, these projects allow us to see beyond\nthe idea that the city as something \u2018for us\u2019 and the natural world is something \u2018in itself\u2019. Presented\ninstead is an ensemble of situations or institutions that give shape, schedule and orientation to the\npatterns of everyday life, constituting a world that is so successfully urban that it is taken to be\nnatural, despite the contradiction this usage implies. I would like to describe this condition as cultural ecology, a topography in which human affairs are synchronised with natural processes:\nbusiness over a breakfast table brightened by morning light, musical performance in the quiet of a cool evening, waterfront leisure on warm weekends, retaining walls resisting erosion while supporting a viewing terrace. Because the situations of urban life are enmeshed in both the histories of a culture and the processes of the natural world, cities are not the result of several architectural projects alone but also the legible face of the social practices they accommodate, when scheduled according to ecological processes, in acknowledgement of their several claims, anticipated and unforeseen. Plato\u2019s last dialogue, Laws begins with three old thinkers climbing Mount Ida toward Zeus\u2019 birthplace. Both their pace and that of the dialogue\nfollow the slow course of the sun on the day before the summer solstice. Four well-worn paths cross\n(and cross out their separateness) as they move toward the cave of beginnings: the philosopher\u2019s\npath; the dialogue\u2019s; the sun\u2019s and the year\u2019s. In this myth, as in the stories proposed by the better\nprojects of our time, a new urbanity is to be synchronised with the cycles that both structure its \nrhythms and transcend them. Whether we call this architecture or landscape is a minor issue, as long\nas the topography we have in mind sustains the kind of culture we unthinkingly assume is natural.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "David Leatherbarrow [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Landscape architecture", "Sumber": "https://search.proquest.com/results/97B666DDA1C64049PQ/1?accountid=31562", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Mar 2019"}
