{"Nomor": 35792, "Judul": "Wastewater microbial community structure and functional traits change over short timescales", "Abstrak": "Wastewater contains microorganisms coming from various sources, e.g. feces discharges, soil infiltrations and sewer\nbiofilms and sediments. The primary objective of this work was to determine if end-of-pipe wastewater microbial\ncommunity structures exhibits short-timescale variation, and assess possible microbial origins. To this end, we measured hourly physicochemical characteristics of wastewater influent for 2 days and analyzed the microbial community at 4-h intervals using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Results showed large variations in the microbial\ncommunity composition at phylum and genus levels, i.e. Proteobacteria ranged from 44 to 63% of the total relative\nabundance and Arcobacter ranged from 11 to 22%. Diurnal patterns were observed in the alpha-diversity, betadiversity and the prevalence of several taxa. Wastewater physicochemical characteristics explained 61% of the\ntotal microbial community variance by Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA), with flow rate being the main explanatory variable exhibiting a clear diurnal profile. Comparison with public databases using closed reference OTUs\nrevealed that only 7.3% of the sequences were shared with human gut microbiota and 21.7% with soil microbiota, the\nmajority being from the sewer biofilms and sediments. The functional trait, weighted average ribosomal RNA operon\n(rrn) copy number per genome, was found to be relatively high in the wastewater microbiota (average 3.6, soil 2.1,\nand human gut 2.6) and significantly correlated with flow, inferring active microbial enrichments in the sewer. The\nprevalence of Methylophilaceae, methanol oxidation genes and denitrification genes were related to high influent\nmethanol and NO3\n? concentration in the influent wastewater. These functional organisms and genes indicate important carbon and nutrient removal related functions in the sewer. Together, the observed temporal patterns of the\nmicrobial community and functional traits suggest that high wastewater flow causes greater transport of active\nsewer microorganisms which are functionally important.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Bing Guo [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Chenxiao Liu.,Claire Gibson.,Dominic Frigon"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Wastewater microbial community Diurnal variation Sewer microbiome Functional traits rrn copy number", "Sumber": "Science of the Total Environment 662 (2019) 779\u2013785", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Mar 2019"}
