From the Maxwell's equations, the curl-curl equation\nin terms of the electric vector potential and the magnetic scalar potential is obtained by decomposing the magnetic\nfield into the incident field and the resultant field. For this method, the only unknown variable in the air is\nthe magnetic scalar potential. Galerkin weighted residual method is adopted to generate the variational equations.\nThenwe made a comparisonwith the edge-based FE method which is in terms of electric fields to validate\nthe accuracy of this method. Later, two types of anisotropic models are studied and the results are analyzed in\ndetail. Finally, based on these analyses, two main meaningful conclusions are obtained.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Tiaojie Xiao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiangyu Huang, Yun Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Magnetotelluric Anisotropy Three-dimensional Modeling Finite element method", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 160 (2019) 171\u2013182, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.11.012", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Jan 2019"}
