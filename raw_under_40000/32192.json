{"Nomor": 32192, "Judul": "STRAIN ANALYSIS IN BANDA SEA USING GRID STRAIN BASED ON GPS OBSERVATION FROM 1993-2016", "Abstrak": "Located in the junction between Australian Plate, Eurasian Plate, and Phillippines\nPlate and Pacific Plate, causing Indonesia has high tectonic activity. In eastern\nIndonesia some block and active fault are generated because convergence between\nplates in there. Tectonic block as one of deformation phenomenom due to the\ninteraction of between plates can be understood by using strain analysis. Strain\nanalysis shows the change of position, shape and dimension from an object. This\nresearch use 80 GPS from previous study by Koulali et al, (2016) and some\nadditional data in this research to calculate strain rates to find relation between\ntectonic activity and strain rate in Banda Sea, and to identify block boundary. The\nGPS data are processed using GAMIT/GLOBK software to obtain time series in each\nstation. Strain rates are calculated using softwae package named grid strain which\ncalculate strain based on interpolation using discretized geodetic measurement\nresulting strain rates in grid system. The data distribution and algorithm in grid strain\ninfluence the result of strain rates from grid strain. The result from strain calculation\nis in ranges -16,421x10-8 to -0,194x10-8 for shortening parameter and 1,653x10-8 to\n18,92x10-8 for extension parameter. From strain analysis conclude that strain rates\ncan identify tectonic activity but not accurately for block boundary. Banda Block,\nTimor Block, and Bird\u2019s Head Block has different strain pattern especially in their\nboundary. Timor and western part of Banda Block dominated by shortening\naccording to the back arc located in there. Banda sea have low strain rates both in\nshortening and extension due to collision effect between Australia aand Eurasia\nPlate, meanwhile in the western Bird\u2019s Head have higher shortening and in the\neastern Bird\u2019s Head has higher extension. For further analysis in determine block\nboundary need some additional data such as density of GPS sites, earthquake, and\ngravity data.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yola Asis Herawati [15112070]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Irwan Meilano, S.T., M.Sc.", "Dr. Ir.
