{"Nomor": 37980, "Judul": "Experimental Investigation Of Wettability Alteration On Residual Oil Saturation Using Nonionic Surfactants: Capillary Pressure Measurement", "Abstrak": "Introducing the novel technique for enhancing oil recovery from available petroleum reservoirs is\none of the important issues in future energy demands. Among of all operative factors, wettability\nmay be the foremost parameter affecting residual oil saturation in all stage of oil recovery. Although\nwettability alteration is one of the methods which enhance oil recovery from the petroleum\nreservoir. Recently, the studies which focused on this subject were more than the past and many\ncontributions have been made on this area. The main objective of the current study is experimentally investigation of the two nonionic surfactants effects on altering wettability of reservoir\nrocks. Purpose of this work is to change the wettability to preferentially the water-wet condition.\nAlso reducing the residual oil saturation (Sor) is the other purpose of this work. The wettability\nalteration of reservoir rock is measured by two main quantitative methods namely contact angle\nand the USBM methods. Results of this study showed that surfactant flooding is more effective in\noil-wet rocks to change their wettability and consequently reducing Sor to a low value. Cedar\n(Zizyphus Spina Christi) is low priced, absolutely natural, and abundantly accessible in the Middle\nEast and Central Asia. Based on the results, this material can be used as a chemical surfactant in\nfield for enhancing oil recovery", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MASOUD AMIRPOUR [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Seyed Reza Shadizadeh", "Hamid Esfandyari", "Saeid Ahmadi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Wettability alteration, Residual oil saturation, Nonionic surfactant, USBM method, Contact angle", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 4, Pages 289-299 (December  2015)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Mei 2019"}
