{"Nomor": 37835, "Judul": "Normal Form for Renormalization Groups", "Abstrak": "The results of the renormalization group are commonly advertised as the existence of power-law\nsingularities near critical points. The classic predictions are often violated and logarithmic and exponential\ncorrections are treated on a case-by-case basis. We use the mathematics of normal form theory to\nsystematically group these into universality families of seemingly unrelated systems united by common\nscaling variables.We recover and explain the existing literature and predict the nonlinear generalization for\nthe universal homogeneous scaling functions. We show that this procedure leads to a better handling of the\nsingularity even in classic cases and elaborate our framework using several examples.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Archishman Raju [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Colin B.
