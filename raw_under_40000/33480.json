{"Nomor": 33480, "Judul": "Distribution and morphometry of buried inlet channels along a microtidal paraglacial coast: Indispensable role of GPR", "Abstrak": "Breaching of coastal barriers, leading to the formation of ephemeral or permanent inlets, is an\nessential element of coastal evolution in many parts of the world. With time, some inlets migrate\nor close, leaving no surface signature of their existence. The challenge of locating these channels\nthrough coring is exacerbated by high gravel content and widespread anthropogenic\ndevelopment. Subsurface imaging using ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is often the only viable\ntechnique to overcome this limitation. GPR surveys carried out across microtidal baymouth\nbarriers fronting salt ponds on Cape Cod, Massachusetts reveal a series of paleo-channels that\nlack any geomorphic expression. In some areas, channel fill comprises 50-80% of the barrier\nlithosome. The pre-closure dimensions of historic channels identified on charts and photographs\nspanning the past 170 years were measured in these subsurface records. In addition, records\nrevealed eight previously unknown relict channel structures with widths (W) ranging between\n25-100 m and depths (D) of 1-4 m. Based on minimum cross-sectional dimensions in GPR\nimages, a W/D ratio of ~40 is characteristic of the natural (unstabilized) paleo-channels. This\nstudy demonstrates that the distribution and morphometry of buried channels based on highresolution\ngeophysical images can be used to reconstruct past equilibrium hydrodynamic\nconditions, with implications for locating important alongshore anomalies and assessing coastal\nvulnerability to breaching.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ilya V.
