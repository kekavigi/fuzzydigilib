{"Nomor": 32459, "Judul": "The use and evolution of design methods in professional design practice", "Abstrak": "Through interviews, observation and document reviews, we investigated how\ndesign methods are applied and developed in a Norwegian design company with\na focus on safety-critical systems. Our analysis revealed that design methods are\nused and developed through pragmatic, cyclic evolutions which vary across\nprojects. Particular methods are adapted to fit situational demands, designers\u2019\nskillsets and the organisation of design activities. We introduce the\npragmatic\nevaluation model\n, a framework to cyclically evaluate and evolve design methods\nin professional design practice. The proposed model can provide opportunities\nfor research aimed at understanding how design methods can be adapted and\nevolved to support professional design practice.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jan Fredrik Sch\u00f8nheyder [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Kjetil Nordby"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "design methods, design practice, evaluation, human factors, pragmatism", "Sumber": "Design Studies 58 (2018) 36-62", "Staf Input/Edit": "Erlin Marliana Effendi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
