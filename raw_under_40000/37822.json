{"Nomor": 37822, "Judul": "SURFACE STRESS PROPERTIES OF DNA-MICROCANTILEVER SYSTEMS", "Abstrak": "For the first time, the connection between surface stress and nanoscopic interactions\nof DNA adsorbed on microcantilever is established by combining Strey\u2019s mesoscopic liquid\ncrystal theory and Stoney\u2019s formula. It is shown that surface stress depends not only on biomolecular\ninteractions of DNA biofilm but also on mechanical properties of cantilever. Considering the\ncorrelativity between grafting density and chain length of DNA chain, we discuss the differences\nbetween DNA-microcantilever system and DNA solution system. The major theoretical achievement\nof this model is to identify the main contributions to surface stress under different detection\nconditions. This provides guidelines for designing new biosensors with high sensitivity and improved\nreliability.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zouqing Tan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Nenghui Zhang, Jingjing Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "surface stress, DNAhybridization,microcantilever biosensor, energymethod, biomolecular interaction", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect : Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 27, No. 2, April, 2014", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Apr 2019"}
