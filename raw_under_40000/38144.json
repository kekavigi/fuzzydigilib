The\nprobability of five year survival of the senior citizens studied increased in accordance with the space\nfor taking a stroll near the residence (p<0.01), parks and tree lined streets near the residence (p<0.05),\nand their preference to continue to live in their current community (p<0.01). The principal component\nanalysis from the baseline residential environment characteristics identified two environment related\nfactors: the factor of walkable green streets and spaces near the residence and the factor of a positive\nattitude to a person\u2019s own community. After controlling the effects of the residents\u2019 age, sex, marital status, and socioeconomic status, the factor of walkable green streets and spaces near the residence\nshowed significant predictive value for the survival of the urban senior citizens over the following five\nyears (p<0.01).\nConclusions: Living in areas with walkable green spaces positively influenced the longevity of urban\nsenior citizens independent of their age, sex, marital status, baseline functional status, and socioeconomic status. Greenery filled public areas that are nearby and easy to walk in should be further\nemphasised in urban planning for the development and re-development of densely populated areas in\na megacity. Close collaboration should be undertaken among the health, construction, civil engineering, planning, and other concerned sectors in the context of the healthy urban policy, so as to promote\nthe health of senior citizens", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "T Takano [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["K Nakamura, M Watanabe"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "the association between greenery filled public areas that are nearby a residence", "Sumber": "https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779935958/fulltextPDF/25BD81E6B2904723PQ/8?accountid=31562", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Mei 2019"}
