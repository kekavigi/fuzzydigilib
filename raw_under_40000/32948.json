{"Nomor": 32948, "Judul": "Study On The Fluid Flow Rule Of Five-Cylinder Plunger Pump Hydraulic End", "Abstrak": "The change of velocity and pressure of flow field in suction and discharge chamber of five-cylinder\nplunger pump obtained by CFD under maximum and minimum stroke, the results show that: when\nthe stroke is 79 rpm, the internal of pump head will produce pressure holding, and the internal organization of pump head body will be in a fatigue state of high pressure for a long time. When the rotate\nangle is small, the peak velocity at the gap of valve disc and valve seat reaches 9.60 m/s, which is the\norifice jet phenomenon. When the stroke is 299 rpm, the overall velocity curve is relatively stable, but the\nvelocity of fluid flow through the pump head body is larger, and the maximum velocity reaches 18.72 m/s\nat the bottom corner of valve, it will produce the circumfluence and vortex discharge chamber at the\nsame time, which will cause the increase of vibration of pump head body. So it should use proper\npunching gear in order to conducive to overall working life of pump.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ZHANGHUA LIAN [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yang Liu, Tiejun Lin , Li Li, Zhongqing Lei , Chuanjun Han"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Five-cylinder plunger pump, Pressure holding, Orifice jet Vibration", "Sumber": "Petroleum 4 (2018) 457-465 - KeAi, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2017.11.001", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Jan 2019"}
