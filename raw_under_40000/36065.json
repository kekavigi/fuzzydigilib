Physicochemical char-acteristics of the prepared Van@GO composites were studiedusing UV?vis and FTIR spectroscopy techniques. Character-ization results confirm the attachment of Vancomycin to thegraphene oxide. A significant inhibition of VRSA growth isachieved by Vancomycin when presented as Van@GO. Thepolyvalent inhibition activity of Van@GO was characterizedby performing bacteriological experiments along withscanning electron microscopy. Results clearly exhibit theenhanced inhibition activity of Van@GO compared toVancomycin alone against VRSA. The high surface area of GO facilitates high loading and multivalent interaction ofconjugated Vancomycin leading to polyvalent inhibition. Further, we found that Van@GO significantly reduces the motility ofVRSA via inducing oxidative stress compared with untreated samples. Ourfindings highlight the importance of Van@GO as aneffective polyvalent inhibition recipe for VRSA", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Vimal_Singh_11.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/161504"}, "Penulis": "Vimal Singh [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Vinod Kumar,Sunayana Kashyap,Ajay Vikram Singh,Vimal Kishore,Metin Sitti,Preeti S.
