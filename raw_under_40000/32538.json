{"Nomor": 32538, "Judul": "A New Formulation of Model Predictive Direct Torque Control for a Sensorless IM Drive", "Abstrak": "This paper is concerned with developing an applicable model predictive direct torque control (MP DTC) for an induction motor (IM) drive. The novelty in this paper is viewed through regulating the reactive power (measured) instead of stator flux (estimated), which gives a more compact control structure. The robustness of the system is enhanced through a sensorless drive operation that is achieved by exploiting the predictive nature of proposed strategy. The paper is organized as follows; firstly, it introduces the theoretical analysis for the proposed control approach. Then the implementation steps are presented. For testing the dynamic performance of the IM drive, experimental tests are carried out by the help of fast control prototyping dSpace1104 board. Obtained results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed control procedure, obtaining fast and precise dynamic response over the required speed range without involving switching tables similar to that used in classic DTC configurations.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mahmoud A.Mossa, Silverio Bolognani [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Induction motor drive; Reactive power; Torque control; Motor drives; Predictive control; Sensorless control, Linear extrapolation.", "Sumber": "IEEE/IET Electronic Library", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
