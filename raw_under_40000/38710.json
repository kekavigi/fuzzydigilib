{"Nomor": 38710, "Judul": "Fabrication of Monolayer of Polymer/Nanospheres Hybrid at a Water-Air Interface", "Abstrak": "A new type of polymer-assisted self-assembly of\nnanospheres at a water-air interface was uncovered. By adding\nmerely 1-3 ppm of polyethylene oxide in the water, the\npolystyrene nanospheres, applicable to diameters ranging\nfrom 100 nm to 1 ?m, were found to gradually move closer\nto each other and eventually form a close-packed structure\nconfirmed from its diffraction pattern. As it turns out, polyethylene oxides are adsorbed onto the surface of polystyrene\nnanospheres, giving rise to the effective screening of coulomb\nrepulsive force between nanospheres followed by the onset of polymer-bridging effect as demonstrated from the strong\nsuppression of Brownian motion. The resulting monolayer of close-packed polymer/nanospheres hybrid at the water-air\ninterface with area size more than 1 cm2 are robust and can be transferred to a substrate of any kind without serious breaking\ndue to surface tension tearing. Our finding may provide a further extension to the scope of nanosphere lithography\ntechnique.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Chi-Chih Ho 1.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170188"}, "Penulis": "Chi-Chih Ho [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Po-Yuan Chen, \u2020 Keng-Hui Lin, Wen-Tau Juan,Wei-Li Lee"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "colloids, polymer materials, self-assembly, hybrid and composite materials, nanosphere lithography, water-air interface", "Sumber": "www.acsami.org", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Jun 2019"}
