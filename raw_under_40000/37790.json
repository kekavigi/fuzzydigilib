{"Nomor": 37790, "Judul": "Low-Scaling Algorithm for Nudged Elastic Band Calculations Using a Surrogate Machine Learning Model", "Abstrak": "We present the incorporation of a surrogate Gaussian process regression (GPR) atomistic model to\ngreatly accelerate the rate of convergence of classical nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations. In our\nsurrogate model approach, the cost of converging the elastic band no longer scales with the number of\nmoving images on the path. This provides a far more efficient and robust transition state search. In contrast\nto a conventional NEB calculation, the algorithm presented here eliminates any need for manipulating the\nnumber of images to obtain a converged result. This is achieved by inventing a new convergence criteria\nthat exploits the probabilistic nature of the GPR to use uncertainty estimates of all images in combination\nwith the force in the saddle point in the target model potential. Our method is an order of magnitude faster\nin terms of function evaluations than the conventional NEB method with no accuracy loss for the converged\nenergy barrier values.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jose A.
