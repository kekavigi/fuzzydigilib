{"Nomor": 32488, "Judul": "Applying the self-explanation principle to multimedia learning in a computer-based game-like environment", "Abstrak": "What is the most effective way to incorporate self-explanation into an educational game? In Experiment\n1, students who played a 10-level computer game about electrical circuits performed better on an\nembedded transfer test (i.e., level 10) if they were required to select the reason for each move from a list\non levels 1\u20139 (selection self-explanation) than if they were not required to engage in self-explanation\n(d = 1.20). In Experiment 2, the same pattern of results was replicated (d = 0.71), but students who were\nrequired to type in their reason for each move on levels 1\u20139 (generation self-explanation) did not perform\nany better than those who were not required to engage in self-explanation (d = 0.06). Overall, asking\nstudents to select a reason from a list fosters some degree of reflection while not overly disrupting the\nflow of the game.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Cheryl I.
