{"Nomor": 32422, "Judul": "Ensemble Forecasts of Tropical Cyclone Track with Orthogonal Conditional Nonlinear Optimal Perturbations", "Abstrak": "ABSTRACT\nThis paper preliminarily investigates the application of the orthogonal conditional nonlinear optimal perturbations\n(CNOPs)\u2013based ensemble forecast technique in MM5 (Fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University\u2013National Center for\nAtmospheric Research Mesoscale Model). The results show that the ensemble forecast members generated by the orthogonal\nCNOPs present large spreads but tend to be located on the two sides of real tropical cyclone (TC) tracks and have good agreements\nbetween ensemble spreads and ensemble-mean forecast errors for TC tracks. Subsequently, these members reflect\nmore reasonable forecast uncertainties and enhance the orthogonal CNOPs\u2013based ensemble-mean forecasts to obtain higher\nskill for TC tracks than the orthogonal SVs (singular vectors)\u2013, BVs (bred vectors)\u2013 and RPs (random perturbations)\u2013based\nones. The results indicate that orthogonal CNOPs of smaller magnitudes should be adopted to construct the initial ensemble\nperturbations for short lead\u2013time forecasts, but those of larger magnitudes should be used for longer lead\u2013time forecasts due\nto the effects of nonlinearities. The performance of the orthogonal CNOPs\u2013based ensemble-mean forecasts is case-dependent,\nwhich encourages evaluating statistically the forecast skill with more TC cases. Finally, the results show that the ensemble\nforecasts with only initial perturbations in this work do not increase the forecast skill of TC intensity, which may be related\nwith both the coarse model horizontal resolution and the model error.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ZHENHUA HUO [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wansuo DUAN", "Feifan ZHOU"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "ensemble forecast, initial perturbation, conditional nonlinear optimal perturbation, tropical cyclone", "Sumber": "ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, VOL. 36, FEBRUARY 2019, 231\u2013247", "Staf Input/Edit": "SYSTEM \u00a0\n                                     Rita Nurainni, S.I.Pus", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
