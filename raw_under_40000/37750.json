{"Nomor": 37750, "Judul": "EFFECT OF ATTRIBUTE COMPLEMENTARITY ON  CONSUMERS\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd WILLINGNESS TO PAY FOR  BUNDLED PRODUCTS", "Abstrak": "In  a  sales  context,  a  common  promotional  tactic  is  to  supplement  a  required  purchase  (i.e.,  \nthe focal product) by offering a free product (i.e., the supplementary product). We examined \nthe underlying mechanism driving consumers\u2019 evaluation of the supplementary product after \nsuch a promotion, with 120 undergraduate student participants at a large public university in \nTaiwan.  Results  showed  that  consumers  demonstrated  higher  (lower)  willingness  to  pay  for  \na  supplementary  product  that  had  higher  (lower)  levels  of  attribute  complementarity  with  \nthe  focal  product.  However,  this  effect  occurred  only  when  the  price  of  the  focal  product  \nwas  much  higher  than  consumer\u2019s  internal  reference  price  for  the  supplementary  product.  \nOur  findings  contribute  to  the  literature  on  bundled  products,  reference  price  theory,  and  \nconsumers\u2019  postpromotion  perception  of  supplementary  products\u2019  price.  Theoretical  and  \nmanagerial implications are discussed", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "C HIEN-HUANG  LIN  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["MING  CHEN"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "attribute  complementarity,  willingness  to  pay,  internal  reference  price,  external   reference price, product promotion, bundled products, conditional promotions.", "Sumber": "SOCIAL BEHAVIOR AND PERSONALITY, 2018,  46 (10), 1637\u20131646", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Apr 2019"}
