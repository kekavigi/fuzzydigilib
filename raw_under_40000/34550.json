{"Nomor": 34550, "Judul": "Shale Hydration Inhibition Characteristics And Mechanism Of a New Amine-Based Additive in Water-Based Drilling Fluids", "Abstrak": "In this work, shale hydration Inhibition performance of tallow amine ethoxylate as a shale stabilizer\nin water based drilling fluid, was investigated through these tests: bentonite hydration inhibition\ntest, bentonite sedimentation test, drill cutting recovery test, dynamic linear swelling test, wettability test, isothermal water adsorption test, and zeta potential test. The results showed that\nbentonite particles are not capable of being hydrated or dispersed in the mediums containing\ntallow amine ethoxylate; tallow amine ethoxylate had shown a comparable and competitive inhibition performance with potassium chloride as a common shale stabilizer in drilling industry.\nSome amine functional groups exist in tallow amine ethoxylate structure which are capable of\nforming hydrogen bonding with surfaces of bentonite particles. This phenomenon decreased the\nwater adsorption on bentonite particles' surfaces which results in reduction of swelling. Tallow\namine ethoxylate is also compatible with other common drilling fluid additives.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Pezhman Barati [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Khalil Shahbazi", "Mosayyeb Kamari", "Amir Aghajafari"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Drilling fluids, Dynamic linear swelling, Hydrogen bond, Mechanism, Shale stabilizer, Tallow amine ethoxylate, Wettability, Zeta potential, Amine-based additive", "Sumber": "Petroleum, Volume 3, Issue 4, Pages 476-482 (December 2017)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Feb 2019"}
