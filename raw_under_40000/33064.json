{"Nomor": 33064, "Judul": "Efficiency of water spraying on a heat exchanger: Local characterization with the impacted surface", "Abstrak": "Due to climate change, worldwide power consumption for air conditioning is forecasted to increase by\n33 times its current level by 2100. To face this trend, the efficiency of air conditioning and refrigeration\nsystems must increase. Water spraying on the condenser of a refrigeration unit is one solution to reach\nthis aim. Indeed, spraying water on a heat exchanger improves heat transfer by adiabatic cooling or direct\nimpact on the heat-exchanger surface.\nIn the present paper, water spraying is designed for an embedded air conditioning application. A pilot\ndesigned for air conditioning conditions was built and equipped with a set of atomizer. The results\nobtained with this pilot show that heat transfer enhancement is higher at low heat exchanger surface\ntemperature. Moreover, a thermal image analysis has highlighted that the surface impacted by the spray\nexcluding the clogged parts is appropriate to express the local efficiency of the spray. Indeed, this surface\nreaches a steady-state approximately after the same time than heat transfer enhancement. This surface\ndepends on heat-exchanger surface temperature, and not on the air flow. Finally, the efficiency of water\nspraying on a heat exchanger is correlated with the impacted surface.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "P.E. Vende [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["F.
