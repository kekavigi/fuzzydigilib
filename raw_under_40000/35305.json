The confining pressures are 5.0 MPa, 7.5 MPa,\n10.0 MPa, 12.5 MPa and 15.0 MPa, and the strain rates varied from approximately 40 s?1 to 160 s?1. The results\nshow that the cohesion is a linear positive correlation with the logarithm of strain rate, and the internal friction\nangle is a linear negative correlation with the logarithm of strain rate. The change of cohesion is more obvious\nthan that of the internal friction angle. The rock parameter m also exhibits a linear positive correlation with the\nlogarithm of strain rate. Furthermore, the relationships between cohesion, internal friction angle and rock\nparameter m and strain rate were obtained. On this basis, the unified dynamic Mohr-Coulomb and Hoek-Brown\nstrength criteria at high strain rates were established. According to the established dynamic strength criteria, the\nstrength of sandstone under high strain rates and low confining pressures can be estimated theoretically. By\ncomparing the theoretical curve and test data, it can be concluded that established dynamic Mohr-Coulomb and\nHoek-Brown strength criteria of sandstone are appropriate for both high strain rates and low confining pressures.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xuefeng Si [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Fengqiang Gong, Xibing Li, Shanyong Wang, Song Luo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Rock, Mohr\u2013Coulomb strength criterion, Hoek\u2013Brown strength criterion, Split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB), Triaxial SHPB, High strain rates", "Sumber": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrmms.2018.12.013", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Feb 2019"}
