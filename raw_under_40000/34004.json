{"Nomor": 34004, "Judul": "SPECTRAL CONTENT OF A SINGLE NON-BROWNIAN TRAJECTORY", "Abstrak": "Time-dependent processes are often analyzed using the power spectral density (PSD) calculated by\ntaking an appropriate Fourier transform of individual trajectories and finding the associated ensemble\naverage. Frequently, the available experimental datasets are too small for such ensemble averages, and\nhence, it is of a great conceptual and practical importance to understand to which extent relevant\ninformation can be gained from S\u00f0f; T\u00de, the PSD of a single trajectory. Here we focus on the behavior of\nthis random, realization-dependent variable parametrized by frequency f and observation time T, for a\nbroad family of anomalous diffusions\u2014fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index H\u2014and derive\nexactly its probability density function. We show that S\u00f0f; T\u00de is proportional\u2014up to a random numerical\nfactor whose universal distribution we determine\u2014to the ensemble-averaged PSD. For subdiffusion\n(H < 1=2), we find that S\u00f0f; T\u00de ? A=f2H\u00fe1 with random amplitude A. In sharp contrast, for superdiffusion\n\u00f0H > 1=2\u00de S\u00f0f; T\u00de ? BT2H?1=f2 with random amplitude B. Remarkably, for H > 1=2 the PSD exhibits\nthe same frequency dependence as Brownian motion, a deceptive property that may lead to false\nconclusions when interpreting experimental data. Notably, forH > 1=2 the PSD is ageing and is dependent\non T. Our predictions for both sub- and superdiffusion are confirmed by experiments in live cells and in\nagarose hydrogels and by extensive simulations.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "DIEGO KRAPF [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["NILS LUKAT,", "ENZO MARINARI,", "RALF METZLER,6 GLEB OSHANIN,", "CHRISTINE SELHUBER-UNKEL,", "ALESSIO SQUARCINI,", "LORENZ STADLER,,", "MATTHIAS WEISS,", "AND XINRAN XU"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW X 9, 011019 (2019); Published by the American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Feb 2019"}
