{"Nomor": 35487, "Judul": "Wastewater treatment in amine-based carbon capture", "Abstrak": "Amine-based CO2 capture (ACC) has become one cost-effective method for reducing carbon emissions in\norder to mitigate climate changes. The amine-rich wastewater (ARWW) generated from ACC may contain\na series of degradation products of amine-based solvents (ABSs). These products are harmful for\necological environment and human health. Effective and reliable ARWW treatment methods are highly\nrequired for mitigating the harmfulness. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive review of the\nexisting limited methods that can guide ARWW-related technological advancements and treatment\npractices. To fill this gap, the review is achieved in this study. All available technologies for treating the\nARWW from washwater, condenser, and reclaimer units in ACC are examined based on clarification of\ndegradation mechanisms and ARWW compounds. A series of significant findings and recommendations\nare revealed through this review. For instance, ARWW treatment methods should be selected according\nto degradation conditions and pollution concentrations. UV light can be only used for treating wastewater from washwater and condenser units in ACC. Biological activated carbon is feasible for removing\nnitrosamines from washwater and condenser units. Sequence batch reactors, microbial fuel cells, and the\nother techniques for removing amines and similar degradation products are applicable for treating\nARWW. This review provides scientific support for the selection and improvement of ARWW treatment\ntechniques, the mitigation of ACC's consequences in environment, health and other aspects, and the\nextensive development and applications of ACC systems.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Cong Dong  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Gordon Huang.,Guanhui Cheng., Chunjiang An.,Yao Yao.,Xiujuan Chen.,, Jiapei Chen"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Carbon capture and storage Amine-based carbon capture Amine-rich wastewater Treatment techniques Review", "Sumber": "Chemosphere 222 (2019) 742-756", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Feb 2019"}
