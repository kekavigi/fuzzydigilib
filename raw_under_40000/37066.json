{"Nomor": 37066, "Judul": "Ambient Surface Stability of Thin Film Nanocrystalline Cu3SbSe4andStructure?Property Relationships", "Abstrak": "Nanocrystalline materials have a high surface areaand hence may be significantly more reactive than their bulkcounterparts under ambient conditions. This may affect devicefunction in unexpected ways. Here, high-quality crystallineCu3SbSe4nanocrystals are synthesized through a hot injectionroute, and thinfilms are deposited through a ligand exchangeprocedure. The electronic conductivity of thefilms increasessignificantly upon exposure to air, up to 80??1cm?1. Thisincrease in conductivity is correlated to a surface oxidation asobserved by XPS. The observed changes in thefilm uponexposure to ambient conditions are suggested to be critical forunderstanding the properties of these materials as they areincorporated into devices", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Daniel_B__Agocs_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/163526"}, "Penulis": "Daniel B.
