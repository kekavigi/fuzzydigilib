{"Nomor": 34240, "Judul": "Algorithm/Architecture Codesign of Low Power and High Performance Linear Algebra Compute Fabrics", "Abstrak": "We show the design of specialized compute fabrics\nthat  maintain  the  efficiency  of  full  custom  hardware  while\nproviding enough flexibility to execute a whole class of coarse-\ngrain linear algebra operations. The broad vision of this project\nis  to  develop  integrated  and  specialized  hardware/software\nsolutions that are co-optimized and co-designed across all layers\nranging  from  the  basic  hardware  foundations  all  the  way  to\nthe  application  through  standard  linear  algebra  packages.\nWe   have   designed   a   specialized   linear   algebra   proces-\nsor  (LAP)  that  can  perform  level-3  BLAS  and  more  complex\nLAPACK   level   operations   like   Cholesky,   LU   (with   partial\npivoting),  and  QR  factorizations.  We  present  a  power  per-\nformance  model  that  compares  state  of  the  art  CPUs  and\nGPUs   with   our   design.   Our   power   model   reveals   sources\nof  inefficiencies  in  CPUs  and  GPUs,  and  our  LAP  design\ndemonstrates how to overcome them. When compared to other\nconventional architectures for linear algebra applications, LAP\nis over orders of magnitude more power efficient. Based on our\nestimations  up  to  55  and  25  GFLOPS/W  single-  and  double-\nprecision efficiencies are achievable on a single chip in standard\n45nm  technology.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_ARDVAN_PEDRAM_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/155350"}, "Penulis": "Ardavan Pedram [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Matematika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Algebra", "Kata Kunci": "Linear Algebra; Power efficient; Accelerator;", "Sumber": "2013 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing, Workshops and Phd Forum Year: 2013  Page s: 2214 - 2217", "Staf Input/Edit": "Dwi Ary Fuziastuti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Feb 2019"}
