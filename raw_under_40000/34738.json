{"Nomor": 34738, "Judul": "Highly Efficient Benzo-Furan-Based Electron Acceptor Derived from One-Pot Synthesis for High-Performance Bulk Heterojunction Solar Cells", "Abstrak": "A new benzofuran-derived fulleropyrrolidine derivative\ndenoted as FB-C60 is synthesized by Prato single step synthetic protocol\nand successfully utilized as an electron acceptor in the bulk\nheterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs). The molecule possesses\nsignificant optoelectronic and redox properties, which are compatible\nwith popular polymer donors. The OSCs constructed from PTB7/FBC60\nblends yielded a highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.1%.\nThe champion device that was fabricated from PTB7-Th/FB-C60 bulkcomposite\nfilm demonstrated a PCE of 9.6%, open circuit voltage of 0.83\nV, series resistance of 3.3 ?\u00b7cm?2 and 75.1% of external quantum\nefficiency at 640 nm wavelength. A promising electron mobility of 1.2 \u00d7\n10?3 cm2 V?1 s?1 of FB-C60 is observed in the fabricated device. FB-C60\nshows the potential to positively replace the conventional PCBM to\nfabricate \u201ccost-effective\u201d high-performance OSCs.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "P.
