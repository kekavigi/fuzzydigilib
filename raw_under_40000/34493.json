{"Nomor": 34493, "Judul": "Design, product development, innovation: all the same in the end? A short discussion on terminology", "Abstrak": "The spectrum of terminology to describe the professional and academic field \u201cdesign\u201d is manifold.\nTerms  like  design,  engineering  design,  product  development,  and  innovation  are  widely  accepted\nand used. Whereas some of these terms are common in the business area, others are rather used in\nthe engineering field. Based on the terminologies from exponents of the design science as well as\nother communities, the paper tries to broaden the view on what \u201cdesign\u201d means. Additionally, the\npaper highlights the accordance and differences between the terms design, product development and\ninnovation, and attempts to derive implications for organising research practice in such a broader\ncontext. The paper should be seen as starting point for a wider discussion.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "CHRISTIAN MARXT [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["FREDRIK HACKLIN"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Design    research    and    methodology;    Design;    Product    development;    Innovation; Terminology; Convergence; Multidisciplinary; Interdisciplinary", "Sumber": "Journal of Engineering Design.
