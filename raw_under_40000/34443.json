{"Nomor": 34443, "Judul": "Prediction Of Oil Flow Rate Through An Orifice Flow Meter: Artificial Intelligence Alternatives Compared", "Abstrak": "Fluid-flow measurements of petroleum can be performed using a variety of equipment such as orifice meters and\nwellhead chokes. It is useful to understand the relationship between flow rate through orifice meters (Qv) and\nthe five fluid-flow influencing input variables: pressure (P), temperature (T), viscosity (?), square root of differential pressure (?P\u02c60.5), and oil specific gravity (SG). Here we evaluate these relationships using a range of\nmachine-learning algorithms applied to orifice meter data from a pipeline flowing from the Cheshmeh Khosh\nIranian oil field. Correlation coefficients indicate that (Qv) has weak to moderate positive correlations with T, P,\nand ?, a strong positive correlation with the ?P\u02c60.5, and a weak negative correlation with oil specific gravity. In\norder to predict the flow rate with reliable accuracy, five machine-learning algorithms are applied to a dataset of\n1037 data records (830 used for algorithm training; 207 used for testing) with the full input variable values for\nthe data set provided. The algorithms evaluated are: Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Least\nSquares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM), Radial Basis Function (RBF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Gene\nexpression programming (GEP). The prediction performance analysis reveals that all of the applied methods\nprovide predictions at acceptable levels of accuracy. The MLP algorithm achieves the most accurate predictions\nof orifice meter flow rates for the dataset studied. GEP and RBF also achieve high levels of accuracy. ANFIS and\nLSSVM perform less well, particularly in the lower flow rate range (i.e., < 40,000 stb/day). Some machine\nlearning algorithms have the potential to overcome the limitations of idealized streamline analysis applying the\nBernoulli equation when predicting flow rate across an orifice meter, particularly at low flow rates and in\nturbulent flow conditions. Further studies on additional datasets are required to confirm this.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "HAMZEH GHORBANI  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["David A.
