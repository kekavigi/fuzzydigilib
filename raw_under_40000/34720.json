{"Nomor": 34720, "Judul": "Study On Gas-Liquid Relative Permeability Experiments Of Fractured-Porous Reservoirs", "Abstrak": "For carbonate reservoirs, gas-water and oil-gas relative permeability curve are of importance for\nparameters calculation in oil-field development, dynamic analysis and numerical reservoir simulation. The oil-gas/gas-water relative permeability curves were measured with unstable method\nunder normal temperature and low pressure, using fifteen artificial fractured cores. The shape and\nchange characteristics of gas/water and oil/gas relative permeability curve were mainly analyzed.\nThe results showed that for the relative permeability curve of water driving gas. The saturation of\nequal permeability point, the saturation range of two-phase flow region and the displacement\nefficiency has a good power-function relation with core permeability. In addition, the saturation of\nequal permeability point, the saturation range of two-phase flow region and the displacement\nefficiency will decrease with the increasing of core permeability. However, for oil-gas relative\npermeability curves, the saturation of equal permeability point, the saturation range of two-phase\nflow region and the displacement efficiency will increase with the increasing of core permeability.\nIt should be noted that the gas relative permeability presents a straight line in the normalized\nrelative permeability curve, which indicates that the main flow is dominated by fracture with low\ndisplacement efficiency.
