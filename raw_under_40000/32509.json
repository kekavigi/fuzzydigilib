{"Nomor": 32509, "Judul": "Critical review Addressing issues in the use of Google tools for assessing pedestrian built environments", "Abstrak": "Numerous techniques for collecting data are available to assess pedestrian built environment features. Recently,\nseveral studies favoured Google tools over conventional data collection techniques because they are more costand\ntime-effective. The use of Google tools to assess pedestrian built environments remains in its early stages.\nVarious challenges are encountered in assessing certain types of features and the intervals between the time of\nimage/video capture and assessment. Thus, an in-depth study on the challenges of employing the Google tools is\nnecessary. This study discusses the issues associated with the use of Google tools to assess pedestrian built\nenvironments and attempts to introduce new objectives for further tools and studies in this field to eliminate the\naforementioned shortcomings of the existing tools.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mahdi Aghaabbasi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mehdi Moeinaddini., Muahammad Zaly Shah.,Zohreh Asadi-Shekari"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Google tools Pedestrian environment assessment Walkability Built environment features", "Sumber": "Journal of Transport Geography 73 (2018) 185\u2013198", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
