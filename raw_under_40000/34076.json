{"Nomor": 34076, "Judul": "MULTIDIMENSIONAL ATOM OPTICS AND INTERFEROMETRY", "Abstrak": "We propose new multidimensional atom optics that can create coherent superpositions of atomic wave\npackets along three spatial directions. These tools can be used to generate light-pulse atom interferometers that are simultaneously sensitive to the three components of acceleration and rotation, and we discuss how to isolate these inertial components in a single experimental shot. We also present a new type of atomic gyroscope that is insensitive to parasitic accelerations and initial velocities. The ability to measure the full acceleration and rotation vectors with a compact, high-precision, low-bias inertial sensor could strongly impact the fields of inertial navigation, gravity gradiometry, and gyroscopy.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "B.
