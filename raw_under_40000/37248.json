{"Nomor": 37248, "Judul": "Experimental Study On Hydration Damage Mechanism Of Shale From The Longmaxi Formation In Southern Sichuan Basin, China", "Abstrak": "As a serious problem in drilling operation, wellbore instability restricts efficient development of\nshale gas. The interaction between the drilling fluid and shale with hydration swelling property\nwould have impact on the generation and propagation mechanism of cracks in shale formation,\nleading to wellbore instability. In order to investigate the influence of the hydration swelling on the\ncrack propagation, mineral components and physicochemical properties of shale from the Lower\nSilurian Longmaxi Formation (LF) were investigated by using the XRD analysis, cation exchange\ncapabilities (CEC) analysis, and SEM observation, and we researched the hydration mechanism of LF\nshale. Results show that quartz and clay mineral are dominated in mineral composition, and illite\ncontent averaged 67% in clay mineral. Meanwhile, CEC of the LF shale are 94.4 mmol/kg. The\nprocess of water intruding inside shale along microcracks was able to be observed through high\npower microscope, meanwhile, the hydration swelling stress would concentrate at the crack tip.\nThe microcracks would propagate, bifurcate and connect with each other, with increase of water\nimmersing time, and it would ultimately develop into macro-fracture. Moreover, the macrocracks\nextend and coalesce along the bedding, resulting in the rock failure into blocks. Hydration swelling\nis one of the major causes that lead to wellbore instability of the LF shale, and therefore improving\nsealing capacity and inhibition of drilling fluid system is an effective measure to stabilize a\nborehole", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xiangjun Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wei Zeng", "Lixi Liang", "Jian Xiong"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Longmaxi, Formation shale, Hydration, Rock failure, Physical and chemical properties, Micro structure", "Sumber": "Petroleum,Volume 2, Issue 1, Page 54-60 (March 2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Mar 2019"}
