{"Nomor": 37565, "Judul": "Science for all: Boosting the science motivation of elementary school students with utility value intervention", "Abstrak": "The need for students to learn science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) has increased steadily, while student motivation in this area continues to fall behind. We investigated the effects of science utility value intervention in increasing the science motivation (i.e., interest in science, appreciation of the role of science in future careers, and intention to engage in science-related activities) of Korean 5th and 6th graders. The usefulness of science for attaining the personal and communal goals inherent to various non-STEM careers was emphasized and internalized through classroom activities including postcard writing. At the end of the semester, students in the experimental group (n=219) perceived greater personal and communal utility in science than those from the control group (n=197). This enhanced perception of science utility led to greater interest, a higher likelihood of cognitively connecting science to future careers, and the willingness to engage in scientific\nactivities.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Dajung Diane Shina [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Minhye Leea, Jung Eun Haa, Jin Hyun Parka, Hyun Seon Ahna, Elena Sonb, Yoonkyung Chungc, Mimi Bong"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Motivation, Science, Classroom intervention, Utility value, Elementary school", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Apr 2019"}
