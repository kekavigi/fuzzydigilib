{"Nomor": 35279, "Judul": "Efficient ROM Method for Calculating Blade Aerodynamic Forces to Upstream and Downstream Perturbations", "Abstrak": "High-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation is now of growing importance to predict the aerodynamic forces of turbine engine blades involving stator-rotor interaction. However, CFD simulation is time-consuming. An efficient Volterra reduced-order modeling (ROM) method is presented to reduce the CFD simulation costs for accurately predicting the aerodynamic forces caused by upstream wake and downstream blocking in stator-rotor interaction problems. The ROM method calculates the aerodynamic forces by first-order multi-input\u2013multioutput (MIMO) Volterra series. The upstream wake (or downstream blocking) is represented by the total pressure waves (or backpressure waves) of a point at the inlet (or outlet) using the traveling wave method. The ROM kernels corresponding to inlet and outlet perturbations are identified by the step method. The accuracy of the proposed method is discussed by two-dimensional (2D) blade examples. The results show that the proposed method is feasible.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP LIZHOU LI 1": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/159388"}, "Penulis": "Lizhou Li [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xinyan Zhang,  Jun Zhang,  Meini Yuan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Volterra, Aerodynamic reduced-order modeling (ROM),  Stator-rotor interaction,  Blade,  Wake,  Blocking", "Sumber": "Journal of Aerospace Engineering ISSN (print): 0893-1321 | ISSN (online): 1943-5525 Frequency: Bimonthly | Sponsored by the Aerospace Division", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos \u00a0\n                                     Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Feb 2019"}
