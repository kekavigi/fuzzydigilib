{"Nomor": 35183, "Judul": "Painting", "Abstrak": "The article explores the meaning of the term painting, as described by the Russian State Academy of Artistic Sciences. It discusses how painting creates an artistic sensory-contemplative unity of spatial relations. It further discusses several characteristics of painting including symbolic expressiveness; and flatness as it gives form to an isolated fragment of material surface. It reports quality of painting being inscribed, because this mode of giving form is realized with the help of inscriptive signs. It suggests that a painting should be distinguished from other forms of non-autonomous inscription in spatial arts.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "N.M.
