{"Nomor": 37595, "Judul": "Van der Waals contacts between three-dimensional metals and two-dimensional semiconductors", "Abstrak": "As the dimensions of the semiconducting channels in fieldeffect\ntransistors decrease, the contact resistance of the metal\u2013\nsemiconductor interface at the source and drain electrodes increases,\ndominating the performance of devices1\u20133. Two-dimensional (2D)\ntransition-metal dichalcogenides such as molybdenum disulfide\n(MoS2) have been demonstrated to be excellent semiconductors\nfor ultrathin field-effect transistors4,5. However, unusually high\ncontact resistance has been observed across the interface between\nthe metal and the 2D transition-metal dichalcogenide3,5\u20139.\nRecent studies have shown that van der Waals contacts formed by\ntransferred graphene10,11 and metals12 on few-layered transitionmetal\ndichalcogenides produce good contact properties. However,\nvan der Waals contacts between a three-dimensional metal and\na monolayer 2D transition-metal dichalcogenide have yet to be\ndemonstrated. Here we report the realization of ultraclean van der\nWaals contacts between 10-nanometre-thick indium metal capped\nwith 100-nanometre-thick gold electrodes and monolayer MoS2.\nUsing scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging, we\nshow that the indium and gold layers form a solid solution after\nannealing at 200 degrees Celsius and that the interface between\nthe gold-capped indium and the MoS2 is atomically sharp with\nno detectable chemical interaction between the metal and the 2D\ntransition-metal dichalcogenide, suggesting van-der-Waals-type\nbonding between the gold-capped indium and monolayer MoS2. The\ncontact resistance of the indium/gold electrodes is 3,000 \u00b1 300 ohm\nmicrometres for monolayer MoS2 and 800 \u00b1 200 ohm micrometres\nfor few-layered MoS2. These values are among the lowest observed\nfor three-dimensional metal electrodes evaporated onto MoS2,\nenabling high-performance field-effect transistors with a mobility\nof 167 \u00b1 20 square centimetres per volt per second. We also\ndemonstrate a low contact resistance of 220 \u00b1 50 ohm micrometres\non ultrathin niobium disulfide (NbS2) and near-ideal band offsets,\nindicative of defect-free interfaces, in tungsten disulfide (WS2)\nand tungsten diselenide (WSe2) contacted with indium alloy. Our\nwork provides a simple method of making ultraclean van der Waals\ncontacts using standard laboratory technology on monolayer 2D\nsemiconductors.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yan Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jong Chan Kim, Ryan J.
