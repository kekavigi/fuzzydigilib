{"Nomor": 38717, "Judul": "College-Mentored Polymer/Materials Science Modules for Middle and High School Students", "Abstrak": "Polymers are materials with vast environmental and economic ramifications, yet are generally not discussed in\nsecondary education science curricula. We describe a program in which college mentors develop and implement hands-on, polymerrelated experiments to supplement a standard, state regents-prescribed high school chemistry course, as well as a middle school\nelective course on polymers. Interactive experimentation and feedback-oriented design are highlighted as critical elements to the\nsuccess of the program. The experiments have been executed in two vastly different institutions: a New York City magnet high\nschool for underprivileged females, and a private middle school for privileged male and female students; the similarities and\ndifferences are juxtaposed", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Robert G.
