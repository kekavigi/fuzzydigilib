A  novel  two-dimensional  (2D)Co(II)-MOF{[Co5(HL)4(dpp)2(H2O)2(?-OH)2]\u00b721H2O}nhas been designed and synthesized byadopting a mixed-ligand strategy, using 1,3-di(4-pyridyl)propane (dpp) colinker with aflexible spacer H3L(H3L: 5-(2 carboxybenzyloxy)isophthalic acid).Co(II)-MOFfeaturesa 2D network, which is further interpenetrated among the equivalent sets and thereforeresults in a 3D supramolecular network. Topologically, the entire network can be viewedas a (3,4,8)-connected three-nodal net with the extended point symbol of {4.5.7}4-{412.52.710.94}{52.8.92.10}2, duly assigned to the novel topological typesmm2. Thefunctional utility ofCo(II)-MOFis demonstrated by employing it toward oxygenevolution reaction (OER) in a photoelectrochemical cell, exhibiting appreciablephotocurrents of up to 5.89 mA/cm2when used as an anode in a photoelectrochemicalcell, while also displaying encouraging electrocatalytic currents of 9.32 mA/cm2(at 2.01 Vvs RHE) for the OER. Moreover, detailed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies confirm enhanced charge-transferkinetics and improved conductivity under illumination with minimal effect of interfacial phenomena. This work provides areference for the expandingfield of research into applications of MOF materials and establishes MOF materials as favorablecandidates for sustainable and efficient design of electrodes for water splitting", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Kaushik_Natarajan_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164891"}, "Penulis": "Kaushik Natarajan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["ShagufiNaz Ansari,Anoop K.
