{"Nomor": 34073, "Judul": "Impact of symbolic product design on brand evaluations", "Abstrak": "Purpose \u2013 The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of symbolic product information (symbolic product design) on consumers\u2019 perceived\nbrand evaluations. In an experimental setting, the authors consider as key factors the congruence between symbolic product design and product\ncategory, the level of product involvement as well as brand strength.\nDesign/methodology/approach \u2013 In an experiment of 490 participants, consumers are confronted to different symbolic product designs\nconnotations. Based on the cognitive process model \u201cSARA\u201d (selective activation, reconstruction and anchoring), the authors examined how\nsymbolic product design associations are used as heuristics in the working memory when making brand judgement.\nFindings \u2013 The results show that product design associations are used in consumers\u2019 information processing as anchor for brand evaluations. This\neffect is stronger if symbolic design associations are incongruent to the product category because of consumers\u2019 deeper elaboration process.\nFurthermore, the impact of symbolic product design is higher for weak compared to strong brands.\nResearch limitations/implications \u2013 This research supports the cognitive process model \u201cSARA\u201d being an appropriate foundation explaining the\neffects of symbolic product design. Further research should extend this experiment, using a field study in a more realistic setting and/or a choice\nsituation between different alternative product designs at the point of sale. Furthermore, the consumers\u2019 elaboration process should be manipulated\ndifferently, e.g. in a mental load condition.\nPractical implications \u2013 Symbolic product design is important to enhance brand association networks in the consumers\u2019 mind, particularly if the\nbrand is weak. Marketers should use incongruent symbolic product information to differentiate from competitors who use \u201cstereotype\u201d product\ndesigns.\nOriginality/value \u2013 Research about product design in the marketing discipline is still limited. The authors analyse the impact of symbolic product\ndesign on brand evaluations in an experimental setting of 490 respondents in four product categories. The findings support that consumers use\nproduct design as heuristics to evaluate brands", "Daftar File": {"2018_EJRNL_PP_CHRISTIAN_BORIS_BRUNNER_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/154555"}, "Penulis": "Christian Boris Brunner [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sebastian Ullrich, Patrik Jungen, Franz-Rudolf Esch"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Brand strength, Product design, SARA model, Symbolic design", "Sumber": "Agri-Food Economics and Social Sciences Division, University of Reading, Reading, UK", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Feb 2019"}
