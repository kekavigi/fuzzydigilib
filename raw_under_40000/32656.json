{"Nomor": 32656, "Judul": "Design-based research: is this a suitable methodology for short-term projects?", "Abstrak": "This article reports on a design-based methodology of a thesis in which\na fully face-to-face contact module was converted into a blended\nlearning course. The purpose of the article is to report on how designbased\nphases, in the form of micro-, meso- and macro-cycles were\napplied to improve practice and to generate design principles. Designbased\nresearch traditionally is associated with multiple iterations of\ndesign, development and revision over a long period of time. This\nchallenges the idea of design-based research being an appropriate\nmethodology for a short-term thesis or dissertation. We argue that\ngraduate students who are limited by time constraints can also\nconduct educational design-based research as long as the relevant\nphases are followed, which can produce significant, appropriate and\neffective design principles. This article suggests that the scope of\ndesign-based research should not be limited to long-term projects\nonly, which restricts the value of implementing this methodology to\nimprove practice.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jessica Pool [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dorothy Laubscher"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "design-research, methodology, project", "Sumber": "North-West University, Faculty of Education Sciences, Self-Directed Learning Research Focus Area, Potchefstroom, South Africa", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Des 2018"}
