{"Nomor": 34881, "Judul": "Prediction Of Sand Production Onset In Petroleum Reservoirs Using A Reliable Classification Approach", "Abstrak": "Controlling sand production in the petroleum industry has been a long-standing problem for more\nthan 70 years. To provide technical support for sand control strategy, it is necessary to predict the\nconditions at which sanding occurs. To this end, for the first time, least square support machine\n(LSSVM) classification approach, as a novel technique, is applied to identify the conditions under\nwhich sand production occurs. The model presented in this communication takes into account\ndifferent parameters that may play a role in sanding. The performance of proposed LSSVM model is\nexamined using field data reported in open literature.\nIt is shown that the developed model can accurately predict the sand production in a real field.\nThe results of this study indicates that implementation of LSSVM modeling can effectively help\ncompletion designers to make an on time sand control plan with least deterioration of production", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Farhad Gharagheizi  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Amir H.
