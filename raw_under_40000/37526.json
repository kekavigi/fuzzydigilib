In this work, a novel antifouling electrochemicalimmunosensor was explored based on the self-assembly of twokinds of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) microgels on the surfaceof graphene oxide for sensitive detection of streptomycin (STR).The microgels modified with glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) andzwitterionic  liquid  1-propyl-3-vinylimidazole  sulfonate(PVIS) were prepared. The microgels with GMA were used bycombining specific recognition of anti-STR. The rapid specificbinding of antigen and anti-STR resulted in a decrease of currentdensity to generate electrochemical responsive signals. Zwitter-ionic liquid-modified microgels were used for antifouling, which can form stronger hydration and show excellent antifoulingability. As a result, we achieved efficient and sensitive detection of STR in the complex sample with evidently resistednonspecific adsorption effect, the wide linear range toward STR was from 0.05 to 100 ng mL?1, with a detection limit down to1.7 pg mL?1. The immunosensor based on the surface functionalization of microgels showed promising applications for thedetection of antibiotics in complex media.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Xiaoyan_He_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164887"}, "Penulis": "Xiaoyan He [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Huimin Han,Liqin Liu, Wenyu Shi,Xiong Lu, Jiandi Dong, Wu Yang, Xiaoquan Lu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "immunosensor, microgels, self-assemble, antifouling, streptomycin", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
