{"Nomor": 34781, "Judul": "Integration of airborne geophysical and satellite imagery data to delineate the radioactive zones at west Safaga Area, Eastern Desert, Egypt", "Abstrak": "The main topic of this study is to use the airborne geophysical data and the satellite images to reveal the\nstructural setting that affect in the distribution of the radioactive minerals in west Safaga Area. The gamma-ray\nspectrometric maps are useful to delineate the boundaries of the rock units. The radioelement maps of K%, eU\nand eTh provide, on a single display, an overall picture of the radioelement distributions across the study area.\nThe high radiometric anomalies are concentrated over the granitic rocks and the granite dykes at the southeastern\nand northwestern parts of the study area.\nThe magnetic data reduced to the north magnetic pole (RTP) was separated to regional and residual magnetic\ncomponent maps to reveal the major deep structures in the area. The depth estimation of shallow and deep\nseated interfaces were calculated through the application of power spectral analysis of the aeromagnetic data,\ntwo main average interfaces at depths 0.2 and 0.56 Km below the measuring level.\nFrom the interpretation of false colored composite images of Landsat-5(TM) and ASTER, (bands 2, 4 & 7 for\nLandsat-5(TM) and bands 7, 3, 1 for ASTER) in RGB, it is easy to distinguish the boundaries between rock units,\naccording to color differences and photo geological characteristics of the rocks, in addition to the band ratio of,\n5/7, 5/1, 5/4 for Landsat TM and the band ratio of 4/7, 4/1, 4/3 for ASTER) in RGB, respectively.\nIntegration of the gamma-ray spectrometric, magnetic maps and the processed satellite images(Landsat-\n5(TM) and ASTER images), revealed approximately rapprochement between the high radiation zones, brakes\nbetween the high and low magnetic amplitude and the surface observed faults and the fractures in the locations\nbetween the rock types boundaries in the studied area.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Salem Barbary Ahmed [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Radioactive zones Spectrometric Aeromagnetic Central eastern desert", "Sumber": "NRIAG Journal of Astronomy and Geophysics, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrjag.2018.07.005", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Feb 2019"}
