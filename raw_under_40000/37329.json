{"Nomor": 37329, "Judul": "From urban ecology to ecological urbanism: an ambiguous trajectory", "Abstrak": "The term \u2018ecology\u2019, which first emerged in relation to the biological sciences in the 19th century, has\nsubsequently undergone a series of conceptual permutations in an urban context. Existing tensions\naround the definition of \u2018the city\u2019 as an object of analysis have become further complicated by the\nincreasing deployment of ecological metaphors in urban design and related fields. It is suggested that\nthe limitations of urban ecology, as a coherent approach for urban analysis or intervention, stem from the\ndynamic, interdependent and historically contested characteristics of urban nature and the ambiguous\ndimensions to ecology as a leitmotif for urban politics.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Matthew Gandy [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "urban sustainability, urban ecology, ecological urbanism", "Sumber": "m.gandy@ucl.ac.uk ; Area, 2015, 47.2, 150\u2013154, doi: 10.1111/area.12162", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Mar 2019"}
