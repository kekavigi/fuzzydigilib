{"Nomor": 34855, "Judul": "Discussion Of The Feasibility Of Air Injection For Enhanced Oil Recovery In Shale Oil Reservoirs", "Abstrak": "Air injection in light oil reservoirs has received considerable attention as an effective, improved oil\nrecovery process, based primarily on the success of several projects within the Williston Basin in\nthe United States. The main mechanism of air injection is the oxidation behavior between oxygen\nand crude oil in the reservoir. Air injection is a good option because of its wide availability and low\ncost. Whether air injection can be applied to shale is an interesting topic from both economic and\ntechnical perspectives. This paper initiates a comprehensive discussion on the feasibility and potential of air injection in shale oil reservoirs based on state-of-the-art literature review. Favorable\nand unfavorable effects of using air injection are discussed in an analogy analysis on geology,\nreservoir features, temperature, pressure, and petrophysical, mineral and crude oil properties of\nshale oil reservoirs. The available data comparison of the historically successful air injection projects with typical shale oil reservoirs in the U.S. is summarized in this paper. Some operation\nmethods to improve air injection performance are recommended. This paper provides an avenue\nfor us to make use of many of the favorable conditions of shale oil reservoirs for implementing air\ninjection, or air huff \u2018n\u2019 puff injection, and the low cost of air has the potential to improve oil recovery in shale oil reservoirs. This analysis may stimulate further investigation", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hu Jia  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["James J.
