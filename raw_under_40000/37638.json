{"Nomor": 37638, "Judul": "DNA-Coated Gold Nanoparticles for the Detection of mRNA in LiveHydra VulgarisAnimals", "Abstrak": "Advances in nanoparticle design have led to thedevelopment of nanoparticulate systems that can sense intra-cellular molecules, alter cellular processes, and release drugs tospecific targets in vitro. In this work, we demonstrate thatoligonucleotide-coated gold nanoparticles are suitable for thedetection of mRNA in liveHydra vulgaris, a model organism,without affecting the animal\u2019s integrity. We specifically focus onthe detection of Hymyc1 mRNA, which is responsible for theregulation of the balance between stem cell self-renewal anddifferentiation. Myc deregulation is found in more than half of human cancers, thus the ability to detect in vivo related mRNAsthrough innovativefluorescent systems is of outmost interest.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJNRL_PP_Maria_Moros_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/165142"}, "Penulis": "Maria Moros [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Maria-Eleni Kyriazi,Afaf H.
