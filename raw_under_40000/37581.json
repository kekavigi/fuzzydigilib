{"Nomor": 37581, "Judul": "STABILITY CHARACTERISTICSOF SINGLE-LAYERED ZINC OXIDENANOSHEETS UNDER UNIAXIAL LOADING", "Abstrak": "This paper is aimed to propose a three-dimensional model which would be used for\ninvestigation on the mechanical behavior of single-layered zinc oxide nanosheets. To develop this\nmodel, molecular mechanics is coupled with the density functional theory. Simulating the hexag-\nonal lattices of nanosheets as a hexagonal mechanical structure composed of structural beam\nelements, the buckling behavior of zinc oxide nanosheets is studied. Effects of different parame-\nters on the stability of armchair and zigzag nanosheets are examined. It is shown that the buckling\nforces of zigzag nanosheets are slightly greater than those of armchair ones. However, with in-\ncreasing size of nanosheets the effect of atomic structure on the stability of nanosheets diminishes.\nBy studying the effect of end conditions on the buckling behavior of nanosheets, it is shown the\nstability of nanosheets is affected significantly by boundary conditions.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "R.
