{"Nomor": 32506, "Judul": "Effects of Different Aging Methods on Chemical and Rheological Properties of Bitumen", "Abstrak": "Bitumen undergoes ageing, which leads to changes in its chemical and rheological properties, causing it to become harder and\nmore brittle with time. This study aims to compare the effects of different laboratory ageing methods on the chemistry and rheology of three\nbitumen types: a Pen 40=60, a Pen 70=100, and a polymer-modified bitumen (PmB). Four ageing protocols were applied: ageing at room\ntemperature, oven ageing, pressure ageing vessel (PAV), and rolling thin-film oven test (RTFOT) combined with PAVageing. The effects of\ntemperature, pressure, and ageing time were studied using dynamic shear tests and infrared spectroscopy. The results highlight the relationship\nbetween chemistry and rheology of bitumen. Bitumen hardening, which was revealed by an increase in complex modulus and a decrease\nin phase angle, was reflected in the growth of specific chemical functional groups. Among all materials, soft bitumen showed the greater\ntendency to oxidize. Different behavior was observed for PmB, which presented the highest resistance against oxidation among the studied\nbitumens, even though the reaction with oxygen caused the deterioration of the added polymer modifiers.
