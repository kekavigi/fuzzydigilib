{"Nomor": 37612, "Judul": "Probability of error for M-branch macroscopic selection diversity", "Abstrak": "Diversity is a well known technique to\nmitigate the deleterious effects of the radio\nchannel as it can reduce the signal variability.\nHowever, the improvement in performance\nobtainable from the use of microscopic diversity is\nrelated to the standard deviation (a) of the lognormal\ncomponent, the improvement decreasing\nas a increases. In this paper a closed-form analytical\nsolution is obtained for the performance of Mbranch\nmacroscopic selection diversity. It has\nbeen found that a composite Rayleigh plus lognormal\ndistribution can be accurately approximated\nby another log-normal distribution. The\nresults indicate that for a BER of and\nU = 9 dB, a 2-branch macroscopic diversity offers\nan improvement of 13 dB. Unlike microscopic\ndiversity, the performance improvement of an Mbranch\nmacroscopic system increases as a\nincreases. The results also show that, for the same\nnumber of branches, macroscopic outperforms\nmicroscopic diversity and the composite microscopic\nplus macroscopic systems.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "A.M.D. Turkmani, PhD, MlEE [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Mobile radio, Dioersity reception", "Sumber": "IEE PROCEEDING", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Apr 2019"}
