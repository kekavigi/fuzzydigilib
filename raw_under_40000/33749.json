{"Nomor": 33749, "Judul": "Mechanical Reinforcement of Free-Standing Polymeric Nanomembranes via Aluminosilicate Nanotube Scaffolding", "Abstrak": "Owing to their nanometer thickness, large lateral dimensions, and self-supporting properties, free-standing nanomembranes (FS-NMs) exhibit outstanding advantages. However, FS-NMs suffer from macroscopic instability, making mechanical reinforcement still a detrimental challenge for their full exploitation. In this paper, we reported a simple strategy for the mechanical enhancement of nanomembranes based on free-standing polymers with thicknesses of less than 100 nm via the incorporation of aluminosilicate nanotube (ASNT) bed scaffolds. The composite nanomembranes of ASNT/ polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) demonstrated a 4-fold increase in tensile strength and biaxial modulus over 43 times higher compared to the PDMS film. This approach could be extended to other polymers, even polymers with a less-film-forming.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Anteneh Mersha       [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Shigenori Fujikawa"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "mechanical strength, flexible, free-standing, ASNTs, polymer, nanomembrane", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Jan 2019"}
