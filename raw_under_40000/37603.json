Here, a 5,5-difluoro-1,3,7,9-tetramethyl-10-phenyl-5H-dipyrrolo-diazabor-inine-derived water-soluble polymer integrated with thiose-micarbazone units was rationally designed and synthesized forthe simultaneous detection and separation of Hg(II) ions inpure aqueous solution. The water-soluble polymer scaffoldpoly(N,N?-dimethyl acrylamide-co-5,5-difluoro-1,3,7,9-tetra-methyl-10-phenyl-5H-dipyrrolo-diazaborinine-2-carbalde-hyde) was synthesized by reversible addition?fragmentationchain transfer polymerization, followed by post-polymer-ization modification with thiosemicarbazide, leading to the formation of the target probe, P1. The nonemitting P1 exhibitedbright yellow emission upon exposure to Hg(II) ions, with a limit of detection as low as 0.37?M. This turn-on emissionbehavior triggered by Hg(II) ions might originate from the suppression of isomerization around the C?N bond of thethiosemicarbazone moiety caused by the formation of a coordination complex between P1 and Hg(II) ions. In addition, P1displayed excellent selectivity toward Hg(II) ions over other metal cations. Finally, the selective removal of Hg(II) ions from anaqueous solution containing various metal ions was achieved by precipitation, which is probably caused by the fact thatcoordination complexes whereby Hg(II) ions acted as bridgeheads between P1 molecules had formed", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Ujjal_Haldar_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/165052"}, "Penulis": "Ujjal Haldar [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hyung-il Lee"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "water-soluble copolymer, chemosensor, mercury (II), BODIPY, metal ion removal", "Sumber": "BODIPY-Derived Polymeric Chemosensor Appended withThiosemicarbazone Units for the Simultaneous Detection andSeparation of Hg(II) Ions in Pure Aqueous Media", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Apr 2019"}
