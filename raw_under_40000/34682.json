{"Nomor": 34682, "Judul": "Characteristics And Significance Of The Penecontemporaneous Karst In Lacustrine Carbonate, Da'anzhai Member, Lower Jurassic, Beibei Area, Eastern Sichuan Basin", "Abstrak": "There are few reports about the penecontemporaneous karst of the lacustrine carbonate of\nDa'anzhai Member which developed on the top of Lower Jurassic Ziliujing Formation, eastern\nSichuan Basin. Based on the analysis of the macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of Heping\nReservoir section in Beibei area, It is discovered that the penecontemporaneous karst in the\nlacustrine carbonate, Da'anzhai Member, and its characters as follows: (1) The dissolved fractures\nand karrens are common, which have been filled with vadose silts, bioclasts, terrigenous quartzes,\ncrystal and intergrown calcites; (2) The penecontemporaneous karstification mainly occurs in the\nmicrites and shell limestones of the middle and upper part of the shallowing-upward sequence,\nand the desiccation cracks occur in some shallowing-upward sequences; (3) Three meteoric-water\ndiagenetic lenses are identified in this section. By further study we also find the factures, stylolite\nand burial dissolution pores occur along the karst system (tubes, conduits and caves of the karst).\nAnd the asphalt not only fills the stylolites and fractures, but also is mixed with the vadose silt in\nthe karst system, although the pore space formed by penecontemporaneous karstification is filled\nwith vadose material and cements. Therefore it is concluded that the development and modification of the tight lacustrine carbonate reservoir of Da'anzhai Member, to some extent, are relevant\nwith the penecontemporaneous karstification, and the penecontemporaneous karst reservoir may\ndevelop in the buried Da'anzhai carbonate of the basin", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Chengpeng Su [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiucheng Tan", "Kailan Shi", "Juan Zou", "Feifan Lu", "Sicong Luo", "Hao Tang", "Xinyu Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Sichuan Basin, Da'anzhai Member, Lacustrine carbonate, Penecontemporaneous karst, Tight reservoir", "Sumber": "Petroleum, Volume 3, Issue 3, 292-300 (September 2017)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Feb 2019"}
