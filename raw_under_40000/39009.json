{"Nomor": 39009, "Judul": "Novel Functionalization of Discrete Polymeric Biomaterial Microstructures for Applications in Imaging and Three-Dimensional Manipulation", "Abstrak": "Adapting ways to functionalize polymer materials is becoming increasingly important to their implementation\nin translational biomedical sciences. By tuning the mechanical,\nchemical, and biological qualities of these materials, their\napplications can be broadened, opening the door for more\nadvanced integration into modern medical techniques. Here, we\nreport on a method to integrate chemical functionalizations\ninto discrete, microscale polymer structures, which are used for\ntissue engineering applications, for in vivo localization, and\nthree-dimensional manipulation. Iron oxide nanoparticles were\nincorporated into the polymer matrix using common photolithographic techniques to create stably functional microstructures\nwith magnetic potential. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we can promote visualization of microstructures contained in\nsmall collections, as well as facilitate the manipulation and alignment of microtopographical cues in a realistic tissue environment.\nUsing similar polymer functionalization techniques, fluorine-containing compounds were also embedded in the polymer matrix\nof photolithographically fabricated microstructures. The incorporation of fluorine-containing compounds enabled highly sensitive\nand specific detection of microstructures in physiologic settings using fluorine MRI techniques (19F MRI). These\nfunctionalization strategies will facilitate more reliable noninvasive tracking and characterization of microstructured polymer\nimplants as well as have implications for remote microstructural scaffolding alignment for three-dimensional tissue engineering\napplications.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP James R.
