{"Nomor": 36634, "Judul": "Spherical Contact Mechanical Analysis Of Roller Cone Drill Bits Journal Bearing", "Abstrak": "Fang contact model is introduced to analyze stress of the spherical fixed ring journal bearing.\nDeveloped calculation programs in the MATLAB software which are utilized to calculate the contact\ncharacteristics of roller cone drill bits spherical fixed ring journal bearing. In addition, effects of\nexternal load, radius clearance values, and material parameter on the mechanics performance were\ninvestigated. The results show that the value of external load has a direct pronounced effect on the\ncontact characteristics of journal bearing. There is a significant positive correlation between contact\npressure and external load, radius clearance value, and the Young's modulus of material. However,\nthere is an evident negative correlation between contact radius of journal bearing and radius\nclearance value, and the Young's modulus of material. The smaller radius clearance value of journal\nbearing is, the more centralized contact region will be, so the corresponding contact pressure will\nbe higher. From the perspective of reducing friction and wear, we need select the materials which\nhave high strength and good toughness. Not only might this can improve the wear resistance, it also\neffectively decreases the contact pressure. In this case, we can prolong the service life of roller cone\ndrill bits journal bearing.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Wei He  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yang Chen", "Junchao He", "Weiling Xiong", "Tong Tang", "Hao OuYang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Roller cone drill bits, Journal bearing, Spherical fixed ring, Contact characteristics", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 2, Pages 208-214 (June  2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Mar 2019"}
