{"Nomor": 33579, "Judul": "Full waveform inversion based on inequality constraint for crosshole radar", "Abstrak": "Cross-hole radar is an effective method for geophysical exploration of\nunderground geological conditions. Besides cross-hole radar, some geological\ninformation can be obtained by other methods, such as preliminary geological survey,\ngeologic drilling and long-distance geophysical prospecting. This information can\nwork as priori information to help interpret cross-hole radar detection data. Full\nwaveform inversion (FWI) is an advanced inversion method for cross-hole radar,\nhaving higher resolution than the ray tomography method. However, traditional FWI\nfor cross-hole radar takes less advantage of the prior information. Therefore, the\nintroduction of the priori information into FWI is worthy of in-depth study to improve\ninversion quality. Here we use a special penalty function to impose inequality\nconstraint on the objective function, and then calculate a new update step length value\ndifferent from the traditional FWI. We use this method to introduce the priori\ninformation and improve the accuracy and stability of FWI. The reasonable value\nrange of weight coefficients is discussed, which can control the strength of inequality\nconstraint. Several inversion examples are designed to validate the effect of this\nimproved FWI method. The inversion examples for synthetic and field data show that\nFWI based on inequality constraint for cross-hole radar has better inversion effect\nthan the traditional FWI. To a certain extent, the introduction of inequality constraint\ncan constrain inversion process, improve the inversion stability and provide higher\nprecision inversion results.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Bin Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Fengkai Zhang, Shucai Li, Lanbo Liu, Yao Li, Xinji Xu, Zhengyu Liu, Qingsong Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Cross-hole radar; Full waveform inversion; Inverse theory; Inequality constraint; Priori information", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics, S0926-9851(18)30498-1 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2019.01.004", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Jan 2019"}
