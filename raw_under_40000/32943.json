{"Nomor": 32943, "Judul": "Application Of A Hybrid Algorithm Epsosa In Well Test Parameter Estimation", "Abstrak": "Estimating the significance parameters, such as skin factor, permeability, wellbore storage coefficient, are\nthe most component of transient pressure analysis. Many optimization algorithms have been applied to\nparametric estimation and realized the minimum error of well test curve. Although a flexible heuristic\nparticle swarm optimization can hunt optimal solution rapidly, it is difficult to search further in the\nvicinity of the optimal solution. Hence, to alleviate the local optimum and premature convergence, a\nglobal hybrid algorithm referred to as particle swarm simulated annealing is proposed, and proves to\nhave better performance of convergence and accuracy than traditional methods, which are more suitable\nfor parameter estimation", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "YONG WANG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Chen Zhang, Mingjun Li."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Parametric estimation, Particle swarm simulated annealing, Particle swarm optimization, Simulated annealing, Transient pressure analysis", "Sumber": "Petroleum 4 (2018) 430-436 - KeAi, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2017.09.007", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Jan 2019"}
