Although oil shales are heavily dependent on oil prices, production forecasts remain positive\nin the North-American region. Due to the complexity of hydraulically fractured tight formations, reservoir numerical simulation has become the standard tool to assess and predict production performance\nfrom these unconventional resources. Many of these unconventional fields are immense, consisting of\nmultistage and multiwell projects, which results in impractical simulation run times. Hence, simplification of large-scale simulation models is now common both in the industry and academia.\nTypical simplified models such as the \u201csingle fracture\u201d approach do not often capture the physics of\nlarge-scale projects which results in inaccurate results. In this paper we present a simple, yet rigorous\nworkflow that generates simplified representative models in order to achieve low simulation run times\nwhile capturing physical phenomena which is fundamental for accurate calculations. The proposed\nworkflow is based on consideration of representative portions of a large-scale model followed by postprocess scaling to obtain desired full model results.\nThe simplified models that result from the application of the proposed workflow for a single well and a\nmultiwell case are compared to full-scale models and the \u201csingle fracture\u201d model. Comparison of fluid\nrates and cumulative production show that accurate results are possible for simplified models if all\nimportant components for a particular case are taken into account. Finally, application of the workflow is\nshown for a heterogeneous field case where prediction studies can be carried out", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "RAUL VELASCO [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Palash Panja, Milind Deo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Hydraulic fracture, Shale, Simulation workflow, Multiwell, Field case", "Sumber": "Petroleum 4 (2018) 134-147 - KeAi, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.01.001", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Jan 2019"}
