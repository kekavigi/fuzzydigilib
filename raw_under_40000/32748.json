{"Nomor": 32748, "Judul": "Workplace road safety risk management: An investigation intoAustralian practices", "Abstrak": "In Australia, more than 30% of the traffic volume can be attributed to work-related vehicles. Althoughwork-related driver safety has been given increasing attention in the scientific literature, it is uncertainhow well this knowledge has been translated into practice in industry. It is also unclear how currentpractice in industry can inform scientific knowledge. The aim of the research was to use a benchmarkingtool developed by the National Road Safety Partnership Program to assess industry maturity in relationto risk management practices. A total of 83 managers from a range of small, medium and large organisa-tions were recruited through the Victorian Work Authority. Semi-structured interviews aimed at elicitinginformation on current organisational practices, as well as policy and procedures around work-relateddriving were conducted and the data mapped onto the benchmarking tool. Overall, the results demon-strated varying levels of maturity of risk management practices across organisations, highlighting theneed to build accountability within organisations, improve communication practices, improve journeymanagement, reduce vehicle-related risk, improve driver competency through an effective workplaceroad safety management program and review organisational incident and infringement management.The findings of the study have important implications for industry and highlight the need to reviewcurrent risk management practices.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Amanda Warmerdam [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sharon Newnam, Dianne Sheppard, Mark Griffin, Mark Stevenson"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Work-related drivers, Benchmarking, Driver risk management, Driver safety, Fleet management, Risk management practicesa", "Sumber": "Science Direct", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "03 Jan 2019"}
