These are determined based on classification of similar logs among different\ngroups of logging data. Data classification is accomplished by different statistical analysis such as\nprincipal component analysis, cluster analysis and differential analysis. The aim of this study is to predict\n3D FZI (flow zone index) and Electrofacies (EFACT) volumes from a large volume of 3D seismic data. This\nstudy is divided into two parts. In the first part of the study, in order to make the EFACT model, nuclear\nmagnetic resonance (NMR) log parameters were employed for developing an Electrofacies diagram\nbased on pore size distribution and porosity variations. Then, a graph-based clustering method, known\nas multi resolution graph-based clustering (MRGC), was employed to classify and obtain the optimum\nnumber of Electrofacies. Seismic attribute analysis was then applied to model each relaxation group in\norder to build the initial 3D model which was used to reach the final model by applying Probabilistic\nNeural Network (PNN). In the second part of the study, the FZI 3D model was created by multi attributes\ntechnique. Then, this model was improved by three different artificial intelligence systems including\nPNN, multilayer feed-forward network (MLFN) and radial basis function network (RBFN). Finally, models\nof FZI and EFACT were compared. Results obtained from this study revealed that the two models are in\ngood agreement and PNN method is successful in modeling FZI and EFACT from 3D seismic data for\nwhich no Stoneley data or NMR log data are available. Moreover, they may be used to detect hydrocarbon-bearing zones and locate the exact place for producing wells for the future development plans.\nIn addition, the result provides a geologically realistic spatial FZI and reservoir facies distribution which\nhelps to understand the subsurface reservoirs heterogeneities in the study area", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mahdi Rastegarnia [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ali Sanati", "Dariush Javani"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Electrofacies, Nuclear magnetic resonance log, Flow zone index, Stoneley wave analysis, Seismic attribute analysis", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 3, Pages 225-235 (September  2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Mar 2019"}
