{"Nomor": 32511, "Judul": "Participatory design for sustainable social change", "Abstrak": "Tendencies in contemporary participatory design suggest a move away from\nengagement of limited stakeholders in preconfigured design processes and\npredefined technology outcomes, towards more complex and long-term\nengagement with heterogeneous communities and larger ecologies of social and\ntechnological transformation. Building on core values of participatory design,\nwe introduce three dimensions of engagement of scoping developing and scaling\nthat we argue can be essential in developing a holistic approach to\nparticipatory design as a sustainable practice of social change. The dimensions\nforeground central aspects of participatory design research that are discussed in\nrelation to a long-term project exploring design and digital fabrication\ntechnologies in Danish primary and secondary education.\n\n@2018 Elsevier Ltd.
