{"Nomor": 36160, "Judul": "Study Of Reservoir Properties And Operational Parameters Influencing In The Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage Process In Heavy Oil Reservoirs By Numerical Simulation", "Abstrak": "This study was originally aimed at suggesting a two-dimensional program for the Steam Assisted\nGravity Drainage (SAGD) process based on the correlations proposed by Heidari and Pooladi, using\nthe MATLAB software. In fact, the work presented by Chung and Butler was used as the basis for this\nstudy. Since the steam chamber development process and the SAGD production performance are\nfunctions of reservoir properties and operational parameters, the new model is capable of analyzing\nthe effects of parameters such as height variation at constant length, length variation at constant\nheight, permeability variation, thermal diffusivity coefficient variation and well location on the\nproduction rate and the oil recovery among which, the most important one is the thermal diffusivity coefficient analysis. To investigate the accuracy and authenticity of the model outcomes, they\nwere compared with the results obtained by Chung and Butler. The privilege of this method over\nthat proposed by Heidari and Pooladi lies in its ability to investigate the effect of thermal diffusivity\ncoefficient on recovery and analyzing the effect of temperature distribution changes on thickness\ndiffusivity. Based on the observations, results reveal that the proposed model gives more accurate\npredictions compared to the old model proposed by Chung & Butler", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Farshad Dianatnasab [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mohammad Nikookar", "Seyednooroldin Hosseini", "Morteza Sabeti"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Simulation ; Steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) ; Heat profile ; Thermal diffusivity coefficient ; Bitumen recovery", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 3, Pages 236-251 (September  2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Mar 2019"}
