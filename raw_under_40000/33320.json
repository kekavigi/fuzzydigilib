{"Nomor": 33320, "Judul": "3-D Scattering Characterization of Agricultural Crops at C-Band Using SAR Tomography", "Abstrak": "The aim of this paper is to interpret and characterize the changes of the 3-D polarimetric scattering signatures of agricultural crops at C-band and to relate them to temporal changes of the soil and plant parameters. For this, a time series of multibaseline (MB) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data acquired at C-band by the airborne F-SAR system of the German Aerospace Center over the Wallerfing test site in Germany was analyzed. The availability of MB SAR data enables the resolution of scattering contributions in height by means of SAR tomography. The tomographic profiles at different polarizations were analyzed regarding temporal changes for different crop types. First, it was investigated if the center of mass (CoM) of the vertical reflectivity profiles as a single parameter enables the tracking of changes in soil and vegetation. The results show that the vertical reflectivity profiles and their CoM do not allow resolving the ambiguity if a change originates from soil or vegetation dynamics as expected. Thus, the scattering contributions from ground and volume were separated in height, using a filtering approach, and used for the estimation of the ground and volume scattering powers by means of covariance matching. Comparing the outputs with coincident ground measurements showed that dielectric as well as geometric changes in the vegetation are traceable by the separated ground and volume powers. Finally, the estimated powers were analyzed with respect to orientation effects, i.e., to polarimetric anisotropic behavior. They were found to be not significant for the crops under study at C-band.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hannah Joerg [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Matteo Pardini, Irena Hajnsek, Konstantinos P.
