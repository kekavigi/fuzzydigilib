Using this strategy, hybridcarbon additives were uniformly introduced into the a-FePO4cathode to form a hierarchical 3D conductive network.Through proper distribution of these components to provideboth long- and short-range electron pathways, the reversible discharge capacity could reach 175.6 mA h g?1at 0.1 C and 139.1mA h g?1at 5 C. The composites of a-FePO4, carbon black, and carbon nanotubes (CNT) exhibited the distinct advantages oflow cost and excellent rate capacity over the composites of a-FePO4and CNT, indicating the importance of optimizing thehierarchical structure of cathode composites. The high effectiveness of this construction strategy to build a hierarchicalconductive network is also promisingly used for the development of other functional nanocomposites.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Zhongyu_Wang_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/165041"}, "Penulis": "Zhongyu Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yangcheng Lu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "lithium-ion battery, amorphous FePO4, carbon materials, cathode construction, hybrid carbon additives", "Sumber": "ite This:ACS Appl.
