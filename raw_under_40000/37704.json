{"Nomor": 37704, "Judul": "Literature review of fingerprint quality assessment and its evaluation", "Abstrak": "Fingerprint quality assessment (FQA) has been a challenging issue due to a variety of noisy information\ncontained in the samples, such as physical defect and distortions caused by sensing devices. Existing studies have made efforts to find out more suitable techniques for assessing fingerprint quality but it is difficult to achieve a common solution because of, for example, different image settings. This study is two-fold, related to FQA, including a literature review of the prior work in assessing fingerprint image quality and the associated evaluation approaches. First, the authors categorised some representative studies proposed in last few decades to show how this problem has been solved so far. Second, this study gives a brief introduction of the associated evaluation approaches, and then contributes an extended evaluation framework based on the enrolment selection, which offers repeatable and statistically convincing measures for evaluating quality metrics. Experimental results demonstrate the usability of the proposed evaluation framework via offline trials.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zhigang Yao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jean-Marie Le Bars, Christophe Charrier, Christophe Rosenberger"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Mobile Biometrics, fingerprint quality assessment", "Sumber": "IET Biometrics", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Apr 2019"}
