{"Nomor": 38707, "Judul": "WaterIons Induced Nanostructuration of Hydrophobic Polymer Surfaces", "Abstrak": "When hydrophobic surfaces are in contact with water in ambient conditions a layer\nof reduced density is present at the interface, preventing the intimate contact between the two\nphases. Reducing the extent of this layer by degassing the water can have remarkable implications\nfor the interaction between the two phases. The enhanced proximity between a hydrophobic\npolymer film and an aqueous solution can induce a self-assembled nanostructure on the solid surface\nthrough the development of an electro-hydrodynamic instability, due to the adsorption of the\nwaterions (hydronium and hydroxyl) at the interface. The self-assembled structure spontaneously\nrelaxes back to the original flat morphology after few weeks at room temperature. This instability\nand the self-assembled structure are controlled by the hydrophobic surface charge, which is\ndetermined by the pH of the aqueous phase, and by the amount of gas dissolved. This effect can be\neasily adjusted to modify different hydrophobic polymeric substrates at the submicrometer level,\nopening pathways for producing controlled patterns at the nanoscale in a single simple waterborne\nstep.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Igor Siretanu 1.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170184", "2019 EJRNL PP Igor Siretanu 1.pdf?_": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170185"}, "Penulis": "Igor Siretanu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jean Paul Chapel, Carlos Drummond."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "nanopatterning . polymer materials . thin films . water/polymer interface", "Sumber": "C 2011 American Chemical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Jun 2019"}
