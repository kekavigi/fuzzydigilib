{"Nomor": 34617, "Judul": "Effect of biochar on heavy metal accumulation in potatoes from wastewater irrigation", "Abstrak": "In many developing countries water scarcity has led to the use of wastewater, often untreated, to irrigate a range\nof crops, including tuber crops such as potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.). Untreated wastewater contains a wide\nrange of contaminants, including heavy metals, which can find their way into the edible part of the crop, thereby\nposing a risk to human health. An experiment was undertaken to elucidate the fate and transport of six waterborne heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb and Zn), applied through irrigation water to a potato (cv. Russet Burbank)\ncrop grown on sandy soil, having either received no biochar amendment or having top 0.10 m of soil amended\nwith 1% (w/w) plantain peel biochar. A non-amended control, irrigated with tap water, along with the two\ncontaminated water treatments were replicated three times in a completely randomized design carried out on\nnine outdoor PVC lysimeters of 1.0 m height and 0.45 m diameter. The potatoes were planted, irrigated at 10-day\nintervals, and leachate then collected. Soil samples collected two days after each irrigation showed that all heavy\nmetals accumulated in the surface soil; Fe, Pb and Zn were detected at 0.1 m depth, while only Fe was detected at\n0.3 m depth. Heavy metals were not detected in the leachate. Tested individually, all portions of the potato plant\n(tuber flesh, peel, leaf, stem and root) bore heavy metals. Biochar-amended soil significantly reduced only Cd\nand Zn concentrations in tuber flesh (69% and 33%, respectively) and peel compared to the non-amended\nwastewater control (p < 0.05). Heavy metal concentrations were significantly lower in the tuber flesh than in\nthe peel, suggesting that when consuming potatoes grown under wastewater irrigation, the peel poses a higher\nhealth risk than the flesh.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Christopher Nzediegwu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Shiv Prasher,.,Eman Elsayed., Jaskaran Dhiman.,Ali Mawof.,Ramanbhai Patel"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Plantain peel biochar Synthetic wastewater Contaminants Potatoes Irrigation Lysimeters", "Sumber": "Journal of Environmental Management 232 (2019) 153\u2013164", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Feb 2019"}
