{"Nomor": 33287, "Judul": "Molecular Dynamics Simulation Of Methane Gas Flow In Nanopores", "Abstrak": "The transport properties of fluids in nanopores are a fundamental scientific issue in the\ndevelopment of tight reservoirs such as shale gas. The flow of gas in nanosized pores is\naffected by a size effect, therefore, the conventional fluid mechanics theory cannot be\napplied. Based on the molecular dynamics theory, the transport process of methane in\ncarbon nanopores was studied, including simulation of the arrangement of the wall atoms,\nslip and transitional flow of methane in the supercritical state and application of different\ndriving forces. The research of this paper revealed that the configuration of the wall\ncarbon atoms, at the microscale, has a greater influence on the density distribution and\nvelocity distribution of methane molecules in the pores, while the change in the driving\nforce has a greater impact on the slippage of methane at the boundary. Particularly, the\ntheoretical model we proposed can predict the transport properties in carbon nanopores, ,\ndemonstrating the sensitivity of driving force, pore configuration and the state of flow for\nmethane gas transport, which can provide the characteristic parameters for the\nestablishment of the seepage mathematical model.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "JING ZHANG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Guihong Pei, Liyin Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Molecular dynamics; Shale gas; Transport property; Carbon nanopore; Numerical simulation.", "Sumber": "Petroleum, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.12.008", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Jan 2019"}
