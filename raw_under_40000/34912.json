{"Nomor": 34912, "Judul": "Advancement And New Perspectives Of Using Formulated Reactive Amine Blends For Post-Combustion Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Capture Technologies", "Abstrak": "Chemical absorption using amineebased solvents have proven to be the most studied, as well as\nthe most reliable and efficient technology for capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) from exhaust gas\nstreams and synthesis gas in all combustion and industrial processes. The application of single\namineebased solvents especially the very reactive monoethanolamine (MEA) is associated with a\nparasitic energy demand for solvent regeneration. Since regeneration energy accounts for up to\nthreeequarters of the plant operating cost, efforts in its reduction have prompted the idea of using\nblended amine solvents. This review paper highlights the success achieved in blending amine\nsolvents and the recent and future technologies aimed at increasing the overall volumetric mass\ntransfer coefficient, absorption rate, cyclic capacity and greatly minimizing both degradation and\nthe energy for solvent regeneration. The importance of amine biodegradability (BOD) and low\necotoxicity as well as low amine volatility is also highlighted. Costs and energy penalty indices that\ninfluences the capital and operating costs of CO2 capture process was also highlighted. A new\nexperimental method for simultaneously estimating amine cost, degradation rate, regeneration\nenergy and reclaiming energy is also proposed in this review paper", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Chikezie Nwaoha  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Teeradet Supap", "Raphael Idem", "Chintana Saiwan", "Paitoon Tontiwachwuthikul", "Mohammed J.
