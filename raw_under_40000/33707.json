{"Nomor": 33707, "Judul": "Long range correlation of preceded pixels relations and application to off-line signature verification", "Abstrak": "Lately, off-line signature verification systems have been reintroduced based on the idea of modelling the signature images with various relations among their pixels. In this paper, a modified version of the partially ordered set feature extraction procedure is presented by enabling distant range interactions between preceded relations of pixel groups. In this way, the spatial diversity of correlation that exists among signature features can be exploited. The motive behind this approach is related to our belief that the particular idiosyncratic writing style characteristics of each individual will be present over the whole length of the signature. Experiments involve the well-known Center of Excellence for Document Analysis and Recognition (CEDAR) and Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia (MCYT) datasets in two popular writer dependent training modes: ...", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hans Loka [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Elias Zois, George Economou"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "pixels relations and application to off-line signature verification", "Sumber": "IET Biom., 2017, Vol. 6 Iss. 2, pp. 70-78, The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2016", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Jan 2019"}
