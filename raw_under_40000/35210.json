{"Nomor": 35210, "Judul": "Analysis of Effect of Fashion  Design Teaching Method  Reform from a Modern Aesthetic Perspective", "Abstrak": "Currently   the   industry   of   fashion   design   is   dominated  by  instrumentalism  and utilitarianism  though implementation  of  aesthetic  thought  is  very  important  for  fashion  design  teaching.  Based  on  the  theoretic foundation of Schiller\u2019s aesthetic thought, and with a perspective of modern aesthetics, this paper studies the effect  of  teaching  method  reform  using questionnaires  on  attendees  of  design  programs  from  three  colleges. Results  show  that  after  the  teaching  method  reform,  there  are  issues  such  as  oversight  of  aesthetic  though education, loss of free spirit, and insufficient perception of beauty and innovation. To address these issues, we should  utilize  heuristic  teaching,  game-based  teaching,  and  experimental  teaching  in  order  to  achieve  better \nlearning  efficiency,  enhanced  role  of  aesthetic  thought  in  skill,  competence,  and  moral  education,  and construction  of  humanity-oriented  teaching  concepts  and  systematic  culture.  This  research  serves  to  provide reference for further fashion design teaching reform in China.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Bojia Lu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Modern  Aesthetics \u2022  Fashion  Design \u2022  Teaching  Method Reform \u2022  Effect  Analysis", "Sumber": "Educational Sciences: Theory & Practice.
