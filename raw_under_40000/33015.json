{"Nomor": 33015, "Judul": "Mathematical Model Study On The Damage Of The Liquid Phase To Productivity In The Gas Reservoir With A Bottom Water Zone", "Abstrak": "The production process in the gas reservoir with an aquifer is complex. With gas production, aquifer\nwater could possibly flow into the production well and accumulate within the well bore, which leads to a\nlower production rate and may even block the producer. However, few studies in the literature investigate the damage caused by the liquid phase in this kind of reservoir or predict gas productivity using\nthe relationship between reservoir pressure and water gas ratio (WGR). For this reason, it is important to\nknow the effects of the formation of liquid phase behavior on production when an aquifer is present\nunder a gas reservoir.\nFrom the results of published literature reviews, we found that studies focused on the production of a\ngas reservoir with bottom water. Nevertheless, for gas well damage from the liquid phase behavior, we\nfound that there was no statistical data or mathematical model of the relationship between reservoir\npressure and the gas oil ratio (GOR), which affects production.\nIn this research, based on the theory of fluid flow in porous media, a new mathematical model of water\nand gas production and a new equation on gas well productivity is developed. To verify the model and\nequation, gas production data collected from the field are applied. By analyzing the typical gas reservoir\nwith bottom water and the collected data, influences from the liquid phase behavior are shown. In this\nway, mathematical relationships between reservoir pressure and the WGR and between the GOR and\nproduction decline were obtained. The new gas productivity model is derived from the gas and water\npseudo pressure functions, which can be applied to analyze well damage caused by the liquid phase.\nIn order to verify the mathematical model, production data were collected from a typical gas reservoir\nwith an aquifer located in the Changxing gas reservoir. The results indicate that a semi-logarithmic linear\nrelationship is obtained between the WGR and productivity decrease. When the WGR increases from 0.5\nto 15 m3\n/104 m3\n, damage caused by liquid phase decreases to 59%.\nThe tendency of gas productivity in the Changxing gas reservoir was obtained so that it decreases as\nreservoir pressure decreases and increases as the WGR decreases. The gradient of the gas productivity\ndeduction increases as the WGR increases. By the end of the data analysis, two linear equations indicating the relationship between gas productivity and reservoir pressure and the relationship between\ngas productivity and the water gas ratio are obtained: QAOF \u00bc A1lnWGR  B1 and QAOF \u00bc A2lnP  B2,\nrespectively.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "XIAOLIANG HUANG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiao Guo, Xinqian Lu, Xiang Zhou, Zhilin Qi, Wende Yan, Jiqiang Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Mathematical model, Liquid phase, Well productivity, Gas reservoir with an aquifer", "Sumber": "Petroleum 4 (2018) 209-214 - KeAi, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2017.12.009", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Jan 2019"}
