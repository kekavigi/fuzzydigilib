{"Nomor": 35194, "Judul": "Geophysical characterization of the role of fault and fracture systems for recharging groundwater aquifers from surface water of Lake Nasser", "Abstrak": "The role of the fracture system is important for enhancing the recharge or discharge of fluids in the subsurface\nreservoir. The Lake Nasser is consider one of the largest artificial lakes all over the world and contains huge bulk\nof storage water. In this study, the influence of fracture zones on subsurface fluid flow in groundwater reservoirs\nis investigated using geophysical techniques including seismicity, geoelectric and gravity data. These data have\nbeen utilized for exploring structural structure in south west Lake Nasser, and subsurface discontinuities (joints\nor faults) notwithstanding its related fracture systems. Seismicity investigation gave us the comprehension of the\ndynamic geological structure sets and proposing the main recharging paths for the Nubian aquifer from Lake\nNasser surface water. Processing and modelling of aerogravity data show that the greater thickness of sedimentary\ncover (700 m) is located eastward and northward while basement outcrops occur at Umm Shaghir and\nAl Asr areas. Sixty-nine vertical electrical soundings (VES\u2019s) were used to delineate the subsurface geoelectric\nlayers along eight profiles that help to realize the subsurface geological structure behind the hydrogeological\nconditions of the studied area.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Khamis Mansour [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Khaled Omar, Kamal Ali, Mohamed Abdel Zaher"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Fracture system Seismicity Groundwater reservoir Gravity VES", "Sumber": "NRIAG Journal of Astronomy and Geophysics 7 (2018) 99\u2013106, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrjag.2018.02.001", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Feb 2019"}
