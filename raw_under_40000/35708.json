Photocatalysis is a promising wastewater treatment method, which is used to\nremove dyes under light irradiation in the presence of a photocatalyst. In this article, titanium dioxide\n(TiO2) photocatalyst was synthesized through sol-gel technique and coated on different substrates (i.e.\ntransparent glass, glazed ceramic tile, and stainless steel) by doctor blade technique. The coated substrates were used in an innovative reactor to remove colors in dye wastewater. The photocatalytic activities of the designed reactor were determined using a synthetic dye wastewater (methylene blue)\nunder UV irradiations (36W-UVA or 30W-UVC lamps). The results showed that the optimum substrate\nyielded the highest color removal efficiency (93.03 \u00b1 0.66%) was TiO2-coated glass under UVC irradiation.\nThe recycling ability of TiO2-coated glass sheet was also evaluated. It was found that TiO2-coated glass\nsheet provided the same efficiencies for 20 cycles. In addition, the actual wastewater from textile industry was tested in this study with different pH values (i.e. pH \u00bc 3e11). The maximum color removal\nobtained was 87.86 \u00b1 0.23% at pH value 11 on TiO2-coated glass under UVC irradiation. The color removal\nwas found to decrease with decreasing pH.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Krit Sirirerkratana  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Patiya Kemacheevakul.,Surawut Chuangchote"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Wastewater treatment Color removal Photocatalysis Titanium dioxide Dye wastewater", "Sumber": "Journal of Cleaner Production 215 (2019) 123e130", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Feb 2019"}
