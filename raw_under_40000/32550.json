{"Nomor": 32550, "Judul": "Mechanisms of tooth damage and Paranthropus dietary reconstruction", "Abstrak": "According to the current fossil record, the extinct hominin genus Paranthropus and the genus Homo both first\nappeared ?2.7 million years ago. Despite this similarity in geological age, Paranthropus evolved enormous postcanine\nteeth with very thick enamel while Homo evolved smaller teeth. Results from contact mechanics models derived from\nmultiple scales of tooth damage (microwear, macrowear, and fracture) are reviewed to examine this evolutionary\ndivergence and the role that diet may have played in it. Each scale of investigation reveals different kinds of evidence\nthat can be combined into a more complete picture of hominin diet and feeding behaviour. Microwear reveals\ninformation about recent feeding events, while macrowear and fracture record longer-term trends. The synthesis of all\nthree levels of evidence exposes significant dietary diversity, not only between these two hominin genera but within\nthem as well. Within Paranthropus, the eastern and southern African species (P. boisei and P. robustus, respectively)\nwere morphologically similar but appear to have been functionally different. Whereas P. boisei apparently used its\nteeth to consume large quantities of low quality vegetation, P. robustus had a more varied diet that included harder\nobjects, possibly items such as seeds, nuts, or underground storage organs.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Paul Joseph Constantino [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Generalities", "Kata Kunci": "Biosurface and Biotribology", "Sumber": "Biosurf.
