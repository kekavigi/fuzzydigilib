The inflammatory molecule, 5-\nlipooxygenase (5-LOX), protein is involved in the pathologic\nphenotype of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) which includes A?\namyloid deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation. This study\ndetermined the level of 5-LOX in serum of AD patients, mild\ncognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and the normal elderly,\nand the rescue effect by YWCS, a peptide inhibitor of 5-LOX\non neurotoxicity by A? amyloid25\u201335 (A?25\u201335) in neuroblastoma\ncells. The concentration of serum 5-LOX was estimated\nby surface plasmon resonance and western blot. The neuroprotective\neffect of 5-LOX peptide inhibitor YWCS in A?25\u2013\n35-induced neurotoxicity was analyzed by MTT assay and\nwestern blotting. We found significant upregulated serum 5-\nLOX in AD patients and also in MCI patients compared to the\nnormal control group. The peptide inhibitor of 5-LOX,\nYWCS, prevented the neurotoxic effect of A?25\u201335 by reducing\nthe expression of ?-secretase as well as p-Tau181 in SHSY5Y\ncells. However, YWCS was nontoxic towards normal\nHEK cells. The differential expression of serum 5-LOX\namong the study groups suggests it can be one of potential\nserum protein marker and a therapeutic regimen for AD and\nMCI. The negative correlation with neuropsychological parameters,\ni.e., MoCA and HMSE, increases its importance and makes it useful during the clinical setup which is very\nneedful in developing countries. Peptide YWCS can serve as\na new platform as a 5-LOX inhibitor which can prevent neurotoxicity\ndeveloped in AD.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Shashank Shekhar [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Saroj Kumar Yadav, Nitish Rai, Rahul Kumar, Yudhishthir Yadav, Manjari Tripathi, Aparajit B.
