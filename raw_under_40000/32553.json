{"Nomor": 32553, "Judul": "Game theory-based optimal deloading control of wind turbines under scalable structures of wind farm", "Abstrak": "This study addresses the problem of how to harvest as much kinetic energy as possible during deloading control of\nvariable speed wind turbines (VSWTs) by distributedly adjusting rotor speeds under scalable wind farm topology. To that end, a\ngame theory-based distributed control framework is investigated to enable the optimal rotor speed setting of VSWTs such that\nmaximal kinetic energy can be stored in rotating masses of VSWTs for further system support, and meanwhile, the power\ndispatch objective for VSWTs can be fulfilled. It is shown that through distributedly detecting the changing network topologies\nwithin wind farm, the proposed methodology enables individual VSWT to adaptively increase its stored kinetic energy while\nrequiring only local information sharing. It is important both theoretically and practically that the design has autonomously\nguaranteed maximal kinetic energy storing for all VSWTs in wind farm of time varying topologies and provides robustness,\nscalability and efficiency in the absence of global information sharing. Simulation results and case studies are included to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controls both in Matlab and DIgSILENT/PowerFactory.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jianliang Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Cyber Physical Power Systems", "Sumber": "IET Cyber-Phys.
