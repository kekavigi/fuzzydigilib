{"Nomor": 34627, "Judul": "Evaluation of advanced oxidative processes in biodiesel wastewater treatment", "Abstrak": "In biodiesel production by alkaline transesterification, a large amount of wastewater containing\na very high amount of organic matter is generated. In spite of this, biodiesel wastewater is a\nneglected residue, which very often does not receive the correct treatment. In this work, we\nhave evaluated the potential of advanced oxidative processes (AOP) in biodiesel wastewater\ntreatment. The efficacy of four AOP, namely Fenton, photo-Fenton, solar photo-Fenton and\nsolar-photolysis, was tested measuring the total organic carbon removal from this residue. As\nwell, the toxicity of the treated residue was investigated by fish embryo tests (FET). PhotoFenton, solar photo-Fenton and solar photolysis led to similar organic load reduction, but solar\nphotolysis (8 h of solar exposure) was considered the best treatment, due to the important\norganic load reduction reached (more than 92%) associated with an ease of operation and a 100\n% reduction in toxicity for Zebrafish embryos in the dilution range studied. In the best cases,\napproximately 6-8% of the organic content in biodiesel wastewater is recalcitrant.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Gabriel Ferreira da Silva Brito [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Rhaul Oliveira., Cesar Koppe Grisolia., Layanne Souza Guirra.,, Ingrid Tavora Weber.,Fernanda Vasconcelos de Almeida"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Biodiesel wastewater; Advanced Oxidative Processes; Fenton; Photolysis; Ecotoxicity; Fish Embryo Acute Toxicity.", "Sumber": "Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology A: Chemistry", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Feb 2019"}
