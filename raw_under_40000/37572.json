{"Nomor": 37572, "Judul": "Topological theory of non-Hermitian photonic systems", "Abstrak": "Here, we develop a gauge-independent Green\u2019s-function approach to characterize the Chern invariants of generic non-Hermitian systems. It is shown that, analogous to the Hermitian case, the Chern number can be expressed as an integral of the system Green\u2019s function over a line parallel to the imaginary-frequency axis. The approach introduces in a natural way the \u201cband gaps\u201d of non-Hermitian systems as the strips of the complex-frequency plane wherein the system Green\u2019s function is analytical. We apply the developed theory to nonreciprocal electromagnetic continua, showing that the topological properties of gyrotropic materials are strongly robust to the effect of material loss. Furthermore, it is proven that the spectrum of a topological material cavity terminated with opaque-type walls must be gapless. This result suggests that the bulk-edge correspondence remains valid for a class of non-Hermitian systems.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "M\u00e1rio G.
