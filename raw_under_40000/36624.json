{"Nomor": 36624, "Judul": "Seismic noise suppression using weighted nuclear norm minimization method", "Abstrak": "The weighted nuclear norm minimization method as an extension of nuclear-norm minimization was applied to\nimage denoising originally. It is a kind of low rank matrix approximation method that can estimate the noiseless\nmatrix from its noise version. The effective structures of image have a certain degree of repeatability and the\nweighted nuclear norm minimization method just utilizes this property to construct an approximate low rank\nmatrix. Taking into account the spatial characteristics of seismic data and the redundancies of valid information,\nwe propose to adopt the weighted nuclear norm minimization method to suppress seismic random noise. In this\nmethod the block matching algorithm is helpful for the recovery of seismic events because the texture blocks\nsharing the same reflection events are the most similar. Even when the signal to noise ratio is ?10 dB, this\nnovel method still be able to clearly recover signals. Experiments on both synthetic and real seismic data show\nthat the weighted nuclear norm minimization method can not only suppress the random noise but also better\npreserves the valid information of seismic signal when compared to the common seismic denoising methods\nsuch as the Wavelet and Time Frequency Peak Filter", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Juan Li [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Daixiang Wang, Shuo Ji, Yue Li, Zhihong Qian"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Weighted nuclear norm minimization Low rank matrix approximation Seismic random noise Block matching algorithm", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 146 (2017) 214\u2013220, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.09.013", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Mar 2019"}
