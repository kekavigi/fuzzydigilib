{"Nomor": 39006, "Judul": "Flexible Transparent Metal/Polymer Composite Materials Based on Optical Resonant Laminate Structures", "Abstrak": "Suitable design of periodic metal/polymer composite\nmaterials is shown to facilitate resonant tunneling of light at absorbing\nwavelengths and to provide a means to significantly reduce optical\nabsorption losses in polymer-based metallodielectric composite structures.\nThe conditions for resonant tunneling are established based on the\nconcept of \u201cphotonic band edge alignment\u201d in 1D-periodic systems. For\nthe particular case of a four-layer gold/polystyrene laminate structure, it is\nshown that the matching of the lower band edge of the 1D-periodic\nstructure with the plasma frequency of the metal component facilitates the increase of optical transmission by about 500% as\ncompared to monolithic film structures of equal total thickness. The effect of sheet thickness on the optical properties of thin\nmetal films is determined and shown to be an important prerequisite for the reliable prediction of resonant metallodielectric\nstructures. The resonant 1D-periodic metal/polymer heterostructures are shown to retain the flexural stability of the polymer\nmatrix and thus could find application as flexible transparent conductors in areas such as \u201cplastic electronics\u201d.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Sudarshan Narayanan 1.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170791"}, "Penulis": "Sudarshan Narayanan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jihoon Choi, Lisa Porter,Michael R.
