(United Nations , 2015) Based on that agreement Indonesian government committed to reducing its greenhouse gasses emission through the First National Determined Contribution Republic of Indonesia agreement (The Republic of Indonesia, 2016). One of the points in the agreement is to cut energy-related emissions is through reducing energy consumption in buildings.      \n \n \n \n\nGlobally, buildings account for 36%-44% of total final energy consumption with 60% of that number comes from the HVAC system. As a leading supplier of HVAC equipment Trane sees that problems as opportunities to offer a new range of product and services which focused on energy conservation measures. This research intended to analyze, formulate and implement sets of strategies to capture that market through the development of a new business model besides enhancing PT. Trane Indonesia value position within the market.     \n \n \n \n\nThe conceptual framework used to perform this research derives from Rothaermel Analyze Formulate and Implement Framework.
