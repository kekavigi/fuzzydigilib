When data sets are large, it becomes impossible to get an overview.\nOBJECTIVE: This work presents a proof-of-concept of automated audio description of data sets up to 100 data points that can be used by persons with visual impairment or persons who for other reasons are unable to use their visual attention for data access.\nMETHODS: A pilot study was conducted to elicit guidelines for oral chart descriptions, after which lo-fi and hi-fi prototypes were designed. Visually impaired and sighted users were involved throughout the process.\nRESULTS: The pilot study pinpointed important issues of oral chart descriptions and provided input for a lo-fi-prototype with three variants. The lo-fi-prototype singled out the most successful way of describing the charts based on which a hi-fi prototype for large data sets was created and tested.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results of the hi-fi tests are promising. Participants listened 1\u20132 times to the descriptions and were able to discuss details in the data. Thus, the initial guidelines and the following design process provided the necessary information to create a successful proof-of-concept.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Celie Gunnarsson [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Julia Hammenberg, Karolina Bornemalm and Kirsten Rassmus-Gr\u00f6hn"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Data sets, automation, audio-description, visual impairment", "Sumber": "Technology & Disability. 2018, Vol. 30 Issue 1/2, p53-62. 10p. 2 Charts, 2 Graphs", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Feb 2019"}
