{"Nomor": 35101, "Judul": "Venus as a Reference for Determining the Qibla Direction in Indonesia", "Abstrak": "One needs of Muslims in worship is to determine the direction of qibla. For Muslims who do not have advanced technology equipment, they can not determine the Qibla at noon, there is one altemative to know the Qibla direction using objects in the nigtrt slqy that is the planet Venus. Based on observations using astronomical calculations in mind that Venus appeared very luminous in the western horizon when the sky conditions at the time it was sunny and the sun had set perfectly. Conversely at dawn in\nthe eastern horizon, we can also see one of the planet is called the morning star. This research answer the question how the stage of determine the direction of Qibla somewhere using the position of the planet Venus and what a proof calculation of position of Venus in the sky. To obtain the direction of Qibla in Indonesia is looking for the planet Venus position data using the coordinate syst\u20acm horizon\n(altitude and azimuth planet Venus) somewhere and then applied to the theodolite. After that, direct the lens of the theodolite toward the position of the planets Venus and rotate clockwise (equal to the difference befween the azimuth angle with azimuth mecca of Venus) to get the true direction of Qibla. So the position of the planet Venus can be used as an alternative to determine the direction of qibla\n\nKey Words: Venus, Qibla direction, and Indonesia", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "A.
