{"Nomor": 32528, "Judul": "Isolation and characterization of fluorophore-binding RNA aptamers", "Abstrak": "The process of \nin vitro\nselection from random sequence\npools, also known as SELEX, has proven to be a powerful\ntool for evolving RNAs and DNAs with well-defined bio-\nchemical functions. This technique has been used exten-\nsively  to  map  the  sequence  constraints  for  biological\nRNAs (e.g. identifying protein-binding determinants), to\nevolve RNAs with altered or novel catalytic activities, and\nto  obtain  molecules  with  highly  specific  ligand-binding\nproperties (aptamers) [1\u20139]. As for monoclonal antibodies,\nRNA aptamers display remarkably high affinity and speci-\nficity for their target ligands. We are interested in exploit-\ning  these  properties  to  develop  aptamers  as  probes  of\nintracellular processes that occur at the DNA and RNA\nlevel. By introducing an aptamer sequence into a particu-\nlar  gene  of  interest,  its  corresponding  transcript  would\ncontain a functional aptamer that might allow identifica-\ntion, characterization, purification and potentially modifi-\ncation of the transcript", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "LESLIE A.
