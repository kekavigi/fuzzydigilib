{"Nomor": 35648, "Judul": "Analytical and numerical modeling of rock blasting operations using a twodimensional elasto-dynamic Green's function", "Abstrak": "Rock media may be exposed to dynamic forces and time-dependent stresses. Dynamic phenomena in rock such as\nblasting and earthquakes need to propagate waves and dynamic stresses through the body. Therefore, stresses,\nstrains, and displacements in rocks should be defined as time-dependent due to the dynamic phenomena. In this\nstudy, a general Green's function solution of an elastic wave propagation due to rock blasting has been analytically derived. The Navier's equations of motion have been assumed as governing equations and a general twodimensional elastodynamic Green's function has been obtained in terms of displacement. The strain and stress\nfields related to the displacement Green's function have also been obtained using the theory of elasticity. Then, a\ngeneric two-dimensional problem containing an explosion in a blast hole has been solved using the resulting\nanalytical solution. Moreover, a similar numerical modeling has been conducted using Finite Difference Method\n(FDM). Eventually, results from the analytical scheme have been compared with the finite difference numerical\nmodeling and the valuable results from a previous experimental and numerical study", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Meysam Lak [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mohammad Fatehi Marji, Alireza Yarahmadi Bafghi, Abolfazl Abdollahipour"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Rock blasting, Wave propagation, Analytical solution, Green's functions, Elastodynamics, Finite difference modeling", "Sumber": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrmms.2018.12.022", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Feb 2019"}
