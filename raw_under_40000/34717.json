{"Nomor": 34717, "Judul": "Selenium removal from petroleum refinery wastewater using an electrocoagulation technique", "Abstrak": "In the present work, an electrocoagulation technique was tested as a possible technological alternative for the\ntreatment of selenium in wastewater from a petroleum refinery. For this purpose, a batch airlift reactor with air\nstirring was used. The sacrificial electrodes were made of iron to generate the necessary ferrous ions for the\nprocess. The results indicated a selenium removal of 90% from the wastewater after 6 h of treatment, achieving a\ndecrease in concentration from 0.30 mg L?1 to 0.03 mg L?1. The current density was found to be an important\nvariable for the process. In conclusion, the electrocoagulation process seems to be a feasible selenium removal\ntechnique applied to petroleum refinery wastewater.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Henrik K.
