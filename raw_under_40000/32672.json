{"Nomor": 32672, "Judul": "Article Development of a General Package for Resolution of Uncertainty-Related Issues in Reservoir Engineering", "Abstrak": "Reservoir simulations always involve a large number of parameters to characterize the\nproperties of formation and fluid, many of which are subject to uncertainties owing to spatial\nheterogeneity and insufficient measurements. To provide solutions to uncertainty-related issues in\nreservoir simulations, a general package called GenPack has been developed. GenPack includes\nthree main functions required for full stochastic analysis in petroleum engineering, generation of\nrandom parameter fields, predictive uncertainty quantifications and automatic history matching.\nGenPack, which was developed in a modularized manner, is a non-intrusive package which can\nbe integrated with any existing commercial simulator in petroleum engineering to facilitate its\napplication. Computational efficiency can be improved both theoretically by introducing a surrogate\nmodel-based probabilistic collocation method, and technically by using parallel computing. A series\nof synthetic cases are designed to demonstrate the capability of GenPack. The test results show that the\nrandom parameter field can be flexibly generated in a customized manner for petroleum engineering\napplications. The predictive uncertainty can be reasonably quantified and the computational efficiency\nis significantly improved. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF)-based automatic history matching\nmethod can improve predictive accuracy and reduce the corresponding predictive uncertainty by\naccounting for observations.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "LIANG XUE [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Cheng , and Lei Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "reservoir simulation; uncertainty quantification; automatic history matching", "Sumber": "Energies 2017, 10, 197; doi:10.3390/en10020197", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Des 2018"}
