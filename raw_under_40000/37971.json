{"Nomor": 37971, "Judul": "A nonparametric approach using clustering analysis to estimate shaliness in shaly-sand formations", "Abstrak": "This work proposes an approach to estimate the clay content of shaly sand formations using Machine Learning\ntechniques. Currently, the main methodology used to investigate shaliness is based on a set of parameters defined\nby interpreters. In this manuscript, we present an nonparametric approach to analyze well logs aiming at automatically estimating such parameters by performing two straightforward steps: i) firstly, a clustering algorithm\nis used to extract patterns to confirm the gamma-ray log bimodal distribution behavior; ii) secondly, we use\nGaussian mixture models to calculate the shales and sandstones means and standard deviations to set the necessary parameters to obtain the shaliness. Another strategy, adopting a similar methodology, was perfomed using\nthe resistivity log to compute the shaliness. Experiments emphasize the importance of our approach, presenting\noutstanding results and allowing us to identify important petrophysical properties, like the shaliness in shaly\nsand models, in accordance with interpreters opinion", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Alexsandro Guerra Cerqueira [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Olivar Ant\u00f4nio Lima de Lima, Ricardo Ara\u00fajo Rios"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Shaly sand formations Shaliness Gamma-ray log K-means Gaussian mixture models Resistivity log", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 164 (2019) 11\u201318, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2019.02.021", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Apr 2019"}
