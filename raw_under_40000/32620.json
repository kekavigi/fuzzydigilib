{"Nomor": 32620, "Judul": "Carbohydrate Functionalization of Few-Layer Graphene through Microwave-Assisted Reaction of Per fl uorophenyl Azide", "Abstrak": "The excellent physical and chemical properties\nof graphene make it an attractive nanomaterial and a\ncomponent in high-performance nanocomposite materials.\nTo prepare graphene-based nanocomposite materials, chem-\nical functionalization is often necessary. Water-soluble ligands\nsuch as carbohydrates not only make the functionalized\ngraphene compatible with aqueous media, but also introduce\nbiorecognition, which is important for graphene to be used in\nbiotechnology. In this study, we report the derivatization of\nfew-layer graphene (FLG) with carbohydrates through\nmicrowave-assisted reaction of per\nfl\nuorophenyl azide\n(PFPA). FLG was\nfi\nrst treated with PFPA under microwave\nradiation. Subsequent conjugation with glycosyl amine gave carbohydrate-presenting FLG. Thermogravimetric analysis showed\nthat microwave radiation gave a higher degree of functionalization compared to conventional heating, with higher weight losses\nfor both PFPA and Man ligands. The carbohydrates (mannose and galactose) retained their bioactivity, as demonstrated by the\nlectin binding assays. Higher degree of binding toward lectins was obtained for the carbohydrate-functionalized FLG prepared\nby microwave radiation than the conventional heating.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Na Kong [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["JaeHyeung Park", "Xiaojian Yang", "Olof Ramstro", "Mingdi Yan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Physical chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "graphene, carbohydrate, per fl uorophenyl azide, microwave radiation, lectin", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
