{"Nomor": 37879, "Judul": "So Long as They Grow Out of It: Comics, The Discourse of Developmental Normalcy, and Disability", "Abstrak": "This essay draws on two emerging fields\u2014the study of comics or graphic fiction, and disability studies\n\u2014to demonstrate how graphic fictions articulate the embodied, ethical, and sociopolitical experiences of impairment and disability. Examining David B\u2019s Epileptic and Paul Karasik and Judy Karasik\u2019s The Ride Together, Iargue that these graphic novels unsettle conventional notions of normalcy and disability. In so doing, they also challenge our assumed dimensions and possibilities of the comics genre and medium,\ndemonstrating the great potential comics hold for disability studies.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Susan M.
