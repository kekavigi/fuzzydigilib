These design\nstrategies were then mapped to urban ecological principles.\nFindings \u2013 In total, 15 actionable design strategies, aligned with four urban ecology principles, were\nidentified for addressing the impacts of secondary forest loss in Singapore.\nOriginality/value \u2013 The paper makes an attempt to bridge theoretical principles and design action,\nand explicates how the two may be aligned. This helps to close a persistent gap between design\nprojects and the science-based design principles generated in the academe. The paper also highlights\nthe potential of academic design studios as a platform for generating ideas to emergent local problems\nnot yet addressed by conventional practice, and offers a range of ideas to mitigate the impact of\nsecondary forest loss in Singapore.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yun Hye Hwang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yuanqiu Feng and Puay Yok Tan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Urban ecology, Deforestation, Design principles, Ecological design strategies, Studio design process", "Sumber": "www.emeraldinsight.com/2046-6099.htm", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Mar 2019"}
