{"Nomor": 37384, "Judul": "HOW DO BUILDINGS MEAN? SOME ISSUES OF INTERPRETATION IN THE HISTORY OF ARCHITECTURE1", "Abstrak": "Despite growing interest from historians in the built environment, the use of architecture\nas evidence remains remarkably under-theorized. Where this issue has been discussed, the\ninterpretation of buildings has often been likened to the process of reading, in which architecture\ncan be understood by analogy to language: either as a code capable of use in communicating\nthe architect\u2019s intentions or more literally as a spoken or written language in\nits own right. After a historiographical survey, this essay, by contrast, proposes that the\nappropriate metaphor is one of translation. More particularly, it draws on the work of\nMikhail Bakhtin to suggest that architecture\u2014and the interpretation of architecture\u2014\ncomprises a series of transpositions. As a building is planned, built, inhabited, and interpreted,\nso its meaning changes. The underlying logic of each medium shapes the way in\nwhich its message is created and understood. This suggests that the proper role of the historian\nis to trace these transpositions. Buildings, then, can be used as a historical source,\nbut only if the historian takes account of the particular problems that they present. In\nshort, architecture should not be studied for its meaning, but for its meanings. As historians\nwe are always translating architecture: not reading its message, but exploring its multiple\ntranspositions.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "WILLIAM WHYTE [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "INTERPRETATION; HISTORY OF ARCHITECTURE", "Sumber": "History and Theory 45 (May 2006), 153-177 \u00a9 Wesleyan University 2006 ISSN: 0018-2656", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Mar 2019"}
