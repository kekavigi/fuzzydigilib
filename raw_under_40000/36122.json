{"Nomor": 36122, "Judul": "Monitoring of the temporal and spatial variation of groundwater storage in the Three Gorges area based on the CORS network", "Abstrak": "The variation of groundwater storage is not well understood due to the complex hydrodynamic environment\nin the Three Gorges area. The variation of monthly groundwater storage from January 2011 to June 2015\nwas directly inverted in the Three Gorges area of China based on 26 Continuously Operating Reference Station\n(CORS) and eight gravity stations with a resolution of 2? \u00d7 2? using the Earth's gravity field and the load\ndeformation theory. The results were then compared with the water level from groundwater monitoring\nwells. The comparison indicates that it is possible to calculate the temporal and spatial variation of groundwater\nwith high precision based on the continuous observation data of CORS and a small amount of gravity stations. Our\nanalysis shows that the groundwater storage was consistent in the Three Gorges area from 2011 to 2014. The\nThree Gorges Reservoir has a large impact on the variation of groundwater storage. The variation of the groundwater\nstorage derived from CORS agrees well with that of the groundwater monitoring wells. The new data are\nimportant references for the research of hydrodynamic environmental change in the Three Gorges area and for\nthe analysis of the impact of water impoundment and drainage in the Three Gorges Reservoir", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Wei Wang  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Chuanyin Zhang, Shiming Liang, Qiang Yang, MinZhang Hu, Wei Feng"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Groundwater storage CORS Three Gorges Loading deformation", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 146 (2017) 160\u2013166, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.09.008", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Mar 2019"}
