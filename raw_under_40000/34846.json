{"Nomor": 34846, "Judul": "The more important role of archaea than bacteria in nitrification of wastewater treatment plants in cold season despite their numerical relationships", "Abstrak": "Nitrification failure of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in cold season calls into investigations of\nthe functional ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms (AOMs). In this study, we report the abundance of\nammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), bacteria (AOB) and complete ammonia-oxidizing (comammox)\nNitrospira in 23 municipal WWTPs in cold season, and explore the correlations between AOMs abundance and their relative contribution to nitrification. The copy numbers of AOA and AOB amoA gene\nranged from 2.42  107 to 2.47  109 and 5.54  106 to 3.31  109 copies/g sludge, respectively. The\nabundance of amoA gene of Candidatus Nitrospira inopinata, an important strain of comammox Nitrospira, was stable with averaged abundance of 8.47  106 copies/g sludge. DNA-based stable isotope\nprobing (DNA-SIP) assays were conducted with three typical WWTPs in which the abundance of AOA was\nlower than, similar to and higher than that of AOB, respectively. The results showed that considerable\n13C-assimilation by AOA was detected during active nitrification in all WWTPs, whereas just a much\nlesser extent of 13C-incorporation by AOB and comammox Nitrospira was found in one WWTP. Highthroughput sequencing with 13C-labeled DNA also showed the higher reads abundance of AOA than\nAOB and comammox Nitrospira. Nitrososphaera viennensis was the dominant active AOA, while Nitrosomonas oligotropha and Nitrosomonas europaea were identified as active AOB. The results obtained\nsuggest that AOA, rather than AOB and comammox Nitrospira, dominate ammonia oxidation in WWTPs\nin cold season despite the numerical relationships of AOMs.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Kai-Ling Pan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jing-Feng Gao.,Xiao-Yan Fan.,Ding-Chang L.,Hui-Hui Dai"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Ammonia-oxidizing archaea Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria Complete ammonia-oxidizing nitrospira DNA-based stable isotope probing Wastewater treatment plants Numerical relationships", "Sumber": "Water Research 145 (2018) 552-561", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Feb 2019"}
