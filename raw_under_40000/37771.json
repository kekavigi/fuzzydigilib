{"Nomor": 37771, "Judul": "Fracture and mechanical characteristics of CO2-saturated sandstone at extreme loading conditions", "Abstrak": "Dynamic compression and Brazilian disc tests were performed on dry, water- and brine-saturated sandstone with\nand without scCO2 (supercritical carbon dioxide) injection. Split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) tests were\nconducted under different strain rates. The full-field deformation and fracturing process were investigated by the\nhigh-speed 3D digital image correlation (DIC) technique with a resolution of 256 \u00d7 256 pixels at 200,000 frames\nper second (fps). The presence of CO2 attenuated the dynamic compressive strength for dry and water-saturated\nsandstone. The dry sandstone has a greater brittleness with the saturation of CO2, but there was an opposite\ntrend for water-saturated sandstone saturated by CO2. The presence of CO2 had less effect on the dynamic\nmechanical properties on the brine-saturated sandstone. The normalised stress threshold for crack initiation\nbecame lower for the dry and water treated specimen but was less effective in brine-saturated sandstone. The\ninjection of CO2 intensified the fracturing degree, branching and altered the crack initiation position under\ndynamic loading. The mechanism of CO2 effect was studied from mineralogical structure alteration based on the\nobservation by scanning electron microscope (SEM).", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "H.Z.
