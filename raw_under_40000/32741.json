{"Nomor": 32741, "Judul": "Influential factors analysis and porosity correction method of nuclear magnetic resonance measurement in igneous rocks", "Abstrak": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) log can provide accurate porosity independent of lithology, and\nNMR logging is more advantageous over conventional logs. In recent decades, it has been broadly applied\nin reservoir evaluation and pore structure study of sandstone and carbonate formations. But in igneous\nrocks, NMR porosity is underestimated compared to the actual porosity, which limits the application of\nNMR measurement in such reservoirs. To tackle this problem, NMR measurements were firstly introduced\nfrom DX, XS, and CPZ regions, China, and the effect of different igneous rocks on NMR porosity was\nanalyzed in detail. NMR transvers relaxation time (T2) of igneous rock is very short and the T2 distribution\nis in fast relaxation region, and the amplitude of NMR signals is so low. From NMR measurement analysis,\nNMR porosity relative error generally increases from acid, middle to mafic igneous rocks. Then, combined\nwith element measurement, some influential factors were summarized from laboratory experiments and the\nrelationships of NMR porosity relative error between different paramagnetic elements and magnetic\nsusceptibility were investigated. The elemental analysis from plasma emission spectrometer showed that,\nNMR porosity relative error is related to paramagnetic mineral contents, and it generally increases as the\niron and manganese contents increase. Moreover, the magnetic susceptibility of igneous rock is usually\nsignificantly greater than the sedimentary rocks, and from acid, middle to mafic igneous rocks, the\nmagnetic susceptibility trends to increase. According the above analysis, some NMR porosity correction\ncorrelations are constructed. Finally, in case study from CPZ region, NMR logging porosity was correlated\nby the constructed correction correlation from iron content of element spectrum capture log, the corrected\nNMR porosity is in good agreement with core porosity, which proves the empirical correction method from\nthe paramagnetic element contents reliable. Therefore, this study provides the foundation for NMR\nmeasurement correction and NMR logging interpretation of such complex igneous rocks formation", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Maojin Tan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Lujuan Fan, Keyu Mao, Jun Li, Chunping Wu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "NMR porosity; Transverse relaxation; Paramagnetic mineral; Susceptibility; Igneous rock", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics, S0926-9851(18)30882-6 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.12.023", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "03 Jan 2019"}
