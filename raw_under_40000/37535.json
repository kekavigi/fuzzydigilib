{"Nomor": 37535, "Judul": "Sequential Ligand Exchange of Coordination Polymers Hybridizedwith In Situ Grown and Aligned Au Nanowires for Rapid andSelective Gas Sensing", "Abstrak": "Combining polymeric materials and conductive one-dimensional metal nanostructures is able to achieveenhanced chemical and electrical properties, but the control over their morphology and spatial arrangement remains a bigchallenge. Herein, by replacing benzenedicarboxylate (BDC) in ZnBDC nanoplates with oleylamine (OAM) in the presence ofHAuCl4, Zn-OAM nanobelts with a highly ordered laminar structure were obtained, on which ultrathin Au nanowires (AuNWs) were deposited and aligned along the long axes of the nanobelts. The resulting Zn-OAM/Au NW hybrid furtherunderwent an OAM-to-2-methylimidazole ligand exchange, resulting in the formation of porous nanobelts composed of ZIF-8nanocrystals interwound with aligned Au NWs. Due to the synergistic effect between the polymeric and metallic structures, theZn-OAM/Au NW hybrid nanobelts and ZIF-8/Au NW porous nanobelts demonstrated fast and selective gas sensing atambient conditions, in sharp contrast to the nonresponsive Au NWs or Zn-based polymers alone.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Pingping_Li_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164908"}, "Penulis": "Pingping Li [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hongfeng Zhan,Suyang Tian, Jialiang Wang,Xiang Wang,Zhaohua Zhu,Jie Dai,Yihu Dai, Zhijuan Wang,Cong Zhang,Xiao Huang,Wei Huang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "coordination polymers, metal?organic frameworks, gold nanowires, aligned growth, ligand exchange, gas sensing,chemiresistive sensor", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
