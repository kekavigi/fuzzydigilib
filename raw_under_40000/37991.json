{"Nomor": 37991, "Judul": "Baryon-Number Violation by Two Units and the Deuteron Lifetime", "Abstrak": "We calculate the lifetime of the deuteron with dimension-nine quark operators that violate baryon\nnumber by two units. We construct an effective field theory for j?Bj \u00bc 2 interactions that give rise to\nneutron-antineutron (n- \u00afn) oscillations and dinucleon decay within a consistent power counting. We\ncalculate the ratio of the deuteron lifetime to the square of the n- \u00afn oscillation time up to next-to-leading\norder. Our result, which is analytical and has a quantified uncertainty, is smaller by a factor ? 2.5 than\nearlier estimates based on nuclear models, which impacts the indirect bound on the n- \u00afn oscillation time and future experiments. We discuss how combined measurements of n- \u00afn oscillations and deuteron decay can help to identify the sources of baryon-number violation.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "F.
