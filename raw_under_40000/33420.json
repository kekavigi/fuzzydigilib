{"Nomor": 33420, "Judul": "Combined analysis of electrical and electromagnetic methods with geotechnical soundings and soil characterization as applied to a landslide study in Campos do Jord\ufffd\ufffdo City, Brazil", "Abstrak": "Every year, especially in summer, Brazil suffers from floods and landslides triggered by intense rainfall. These\nlandslides are responsible for many fatalities and material losses that greatly affect the local population. The municipality of Campos do Jord\u00e3o, in S\u00e3o Paulo state, presents such a history of mass movements that have resulted\nin fatalities and financial losses. A map of the municipality's risk assessment shows that about 32% of the\nmunicipality's population lives in risky areas. For this reason, Campos do Jord\u00e3o is currently one of the pilot\nareas being used in studies for understanding landslides and mitigation techniques. In this context, this paper\npresents the results of an integration of geophysical surveys of, and geotechnical information on, the area. The\ngeophysical methods applied were electrical resistivity, induced polarization, and frequency-domain electromagnetics. The geotechnical data included standard penetration test soundings and soil characterization\n(using particle density and X-ray fluorescence methods). The main contribution of this work is to present results\nfrom the joint application of these methodologies. Results from one of the critical areas, where a school had suffered the impact of a mass movement, indicated the displacement and burial of the retaining wall, which was\nbuilt in 2002, as well as the shape of the movement, which affected the foundations of the school. It was also\npossible to determine the critical geological structures involved in the slope dislocation, and the potential problems with the school's foundations. The combined application of geophysical and geotechnical methods to landslide research is not very common, and so this study aimed to provide a field-based example to demonstrate the\npotential utility of such an integrated approach. The aim was also to foster collaboration with studies of mass\nmovements in Brazil and help create methodologies for investigating and understanding the phenomenon", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Cassiano Antonio Bortolozo [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mariana Ferreira Benessiuti Motta, Marcio Roberto Magalh\u00e3es de Andrade, Laura Vanessa Araque Lavalle, Rodolfo Moreda Mendes, Silvio Jorge Coelho Sim\u00f5es, Tatiana Sussel Gon\u00e7alves Mendes, Luana Albertani Pampuch"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Electrical method Electromagnetic method Mass movements Geotechnical surveys Soil characterization Campos do Jord\u00e3o, S\u00e3o Paulo State \u2013 Brazil", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 161 (2019) 1\u201314, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.11.017", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Jan 2019"}
