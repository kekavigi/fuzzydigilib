{"Nomor": 36230, "Judul": "Conformal Hollow Carbon Sphere Coated on Sn4P3Microspheres asHigh-Rate and Cycle-Stable Anode Materials with Superior SodiumStorage Capability", "Abstrak": "Rational synthetic design of Sn4P3-based materials with uniquemorphological structure and superior sodium storage capability for sodium ion batteries(SIBs) is crucially and urgently needed. In this work, Sn4P3microspheres encapsulated inhollow carbon spheres (Sn4P3@C) are prepared by a low temperature phosphorized routeusing SnO2@C as the precursor. The XRD, XPS and TEM results show that multipleSn4P3microspheres with a diameter of 200 nm are conformally encapsulated in a hollowcarbon shell. This void volume and the elasticity of protective carbon spherical shell canefficiently mitigate volume change of active Sn4P3microspheres and form the stable solidelectrolyte interfacefilm on the surface of the carbon shell during charge/dischargeprocess. When assembled as a negative electrode material into SIBs, the Sn4P3@Ccomposite shows a stable specific capacity of 420 mAh g?1after 300 cycles at a currentdensity of 0.2 A g?1, as well as excellent rate capabilities of 424, 310, 253, 175, 111, 78,and 50 mAh g?1at the density of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 A g?1, respectively. Moreimportantly, as-prepared Sn4P3@C composite shows ultralong cycling performance (after 4000 cycles, at large current densitiesof 2 and 5 A g?1, the stable capacities are 205 and 103 mAh g?1, respectively). It is demonstrated that the Sn4P3@C compositewith the unique morphological design can improve electrochemical cycling performance and rate capability of Sn4P3. Therefore,it can be expected that our Sn4P3@C composite is a promising excellent anode material for SIBs", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Erzhuang_Pan_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/161831"}, "Penulis": "Erzhuang Pan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yuhong Jin,Chenchen Zhao,Miao Jia,Qianqian Chang,Mengqiu Jia,Li Wang,Xiangming He"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Sn4P3microspheres, hollow carbon spheres, high-rate, anode material, sodium ion battery", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
