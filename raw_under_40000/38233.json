{"Nomor": 38233, "Judul": "Constraints on Symmetries from Holography", "Abstrak": "In this Letter we show that a set of old conjectures about symmetries in quantum gravity hold within the\nanti\u2013de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence. These conjectures are that no global symmetries are\npossible, that internal gauge symmetries must come with dynamical objects that transform in all irreducible\nrepresentations, and that internal gauge groups must be compact. These conjectures are not obviously true\nfrom a bulk perspective, they are nontrivial consequences of the nonperturbative consistency of the\ncorrespondence.More details of and background for these arguments are presented in an accompanying paper.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Daniel Harlow [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hirosi Ooguri"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 122, 191601 (2019); Published by the American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Mei 2019"}
