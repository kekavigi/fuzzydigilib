{"Nomor": 35200, "Judul": "Water and energy recovery: The future of wastewater in China", "Abstrak": "China is increasing its use of non-conventionalwater sources \u2013 seawater desalination, surface water transfer and\nwastewater reuse \u2013 to meet demand. Getting and treating water from these sources generally requires more energy\nthan is needed for local freshwater sources. This increases the cost and greenhouse gas emissions associated\nwith water supply. It also leads us to the question: are alternativewater sources necessary and, if so,which source\nshould be preferred? Here we argue that reclaiming and reusing wastewater is often the least energy-intensive\nalternative source for water-scarce areas of China, particularly when energy present in wastewater is recovered\nduring the process.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Kate Smith [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Shuming Liu.,Hong-Ying Hu.,Xin Dong.,Xianghua Wen"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Reclamation Anaerobic digestion Sludge disposal Regulation Wastewater reuse Biogas", "Sumber": "Science of the Total Environment 637\u2013638 (2018) 1466\u20131470", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Feb 2019"}
