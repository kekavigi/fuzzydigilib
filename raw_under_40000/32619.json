Planck was the last in a line of three\nmajor space telescopes to study the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the faint afterglow of the Big Bang, resulting in the most precise measurements yet of the age,geometry and composition of the cosmos. With space agencies in Europe and the United States hesitant to fund a follow-up mission, Planck looks set to be the last CMB-focused satellite for many years \u2014 marking a big change for cosmologists.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "DAVIDE CASTELVECCHI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Astronomi", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "26 J U LY 2018 | VOL 559 | NATUR E | 455", "Staf Input/Edit": "pustaka bosscha", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Des 2018"}
