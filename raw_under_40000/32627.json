{"Nomor": 32627, "Judul": "Heat Transfer Properties of a Series of Oxidized and Unoxidized Vegetable Oils in Comparison with Petroleum Oil-Based Quenchants", "Abstrak": "Vegetable oils, especially soybean oil, exhibit substantially poorer thermal-oxidative stability than\ncommercially available petroleum oil quenchant formulations. Therefore, to achieve any commercially\ninteresting performance, vegetable oils must be stabilized by the addition of antioxidant inhibitors. This\nwork describes the ability of two commercially available antioxidants, Irganox L 57 and Irganox L 109, to\nstabilize soybean oil against thermal-oxidative degradation. In addition, the effect of antioxidant stabilization on quenching performance was evaluated by determining the profile of heat transfer coefficient\nvariation throughout the quenching process at different times after being subjected to an accelerated\nthermal-oxidation aging test. The results of this work are discussed here.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ESTER CARVALHODE SOUZA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Lauralice C.F.
