{"Nomor": 32976, "Judul": "A Novel Shan And Chen Type Lattice Boltzmann Two Phase Method To Study The Capillary Pressure Curves Of An Oil Water Pair In A Porous Media", "Abstrak": "In this study, an immiscible oil-water two phase flow in a typical porous media was modeled using the\nwell-known Lattice Boltzmann method. A set of flow tests for modeling an oil-water two phase flow in\nthe porous media were conducted to generate the capillary pressure curves for two distinctive initial\nconditions, namely, water and oil dispersed conditions in two domains of different resolutions. Based on\nthe obtained results, the general trend of these curves has an acceptable agreement with the usual trend\nof these curves in hydrocarbon reservoirs and the capillary data are independent of the initial conditions.\nAlso, the results showed the effect of grid resolution on capillary data which are validated quantitatively\nby proposing a new approach using Purcell's equation. One can see that they are compatible with the\ngeometrical characteristics of the porous media as well as the conditions governing the tests. Finally,\nanother set of tests for oil water pairs of higher viscosity ratio up to 4.4 was performed in a low porosity\nheterogeneous porous media and the viscous coupling effect on capillary data, due to viscosity ratio, was\nstudied to strengthen the model validation.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SAHAND NEKOEIAN [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ataallah Soltani Goharrizi, Mohammad Jamialahmadi, Saeed Jafari, Fatemeh Sotoudeh"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Immiscible two phase flow, Lattice Boltzmann method, Shan and Chen model, Capillary pressure curves, Purcell's equation", "Sumber": "Petroleum 4 (2018) 347-357 - KeAi, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.03.010", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Jan 2019"}
