{"Nomor": 32967, "Judul": "Experimental Research Of Condensate Blockage And Mitigating Effect Of Gas Injection", "Abstrak": "The condensate blockage causes a substantial decrease in well productivity for gas condensate reservoirs.\nBased on the previous studies, a novel experimental method was designed to evaluate condensate\nblockage and the mitigating effect of gas injection. The method considers the stacking effect in the near\nwellbore region and the gas flow in the far wellbore region. There is an intermediate vessel containing\ncondensate gas at the entrance of core holder in the experimental apparatus. In the process of pressure\ndepletion experiment in a long core model, the vessel is connected to the core and the pressure of the\nvessel remains above the dew point pressure. The seriousness of condensate blockage is investigated by\nthis research. When pressure drops to maximum retrograde condensation pressure, the gas permeability\ndecreases by 80% compared with the initial gas permeability. Contrastive experiments were conducted to\nstudy the removal effect of different injection fluids and different injection volumes. The results show\nthat CO2 injection is more effective than methanol in mitigating condensate blockage and the optimal\nCO2 injection volume is around 0.15 HCPV.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ZHOUHUA WANG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Shili Zhu, Wei Zhou, Huang Liu, Yisheng Hu, Ping Guo a , Jianfen Du, Junjie Ren"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Condensate blockage, Experiment method, CO2 injection, Injection volume", "Sumber": "Petroleum 4 (2018) 292-299 - KeAi, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.03.008", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Jan 2019"}
