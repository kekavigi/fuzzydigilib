{"Nomor": 38138, "Judul": "New Movie Theater Design-Bid-Build Project", "Abstrak": "This month\u2019s column will focus on the B2B January test for Places of Assembly described in the 2015 ASHRAE Handbook \u2014 HVAC\nApplication. It would be very beneficial for the theater owner to read the HVAC Application Handbook, chapter 5, to be knowledgeable\nof ASHRAE\u2019s guidelines when preparing to authorize the public theater design.\nThe owner\u2019s facility management group should also read chapters 36 through 43 to assist in preparing the building operation and\nmanagement design guidelines. This information, combined with the owner\u2019s own knowledge of operating a theater, will assist the\ndesign team in understanding intricacies of owning, operating, and managing these places of public assembly. It is also recommended\nthat the owner-design team read chapter 59 of the same ASHRAE handbook, titled HVAC Security, and consider having\na security consultant on board to contribute to a safer building design.\nWith all these design guidelines from ASHRAE, the engineer should meet with the theater owner\u2019s facility management/maintenance\nmanager to discuss specific building standards that need to be applied to this project. If the theater on-site management is\ngoing to be outsourced, the design team needs to know this in advance to adjust their contract specifications pertaining to O&M,\ntraining, preventive maintenance work order system, and energy operating budget. One resource pertaining to O&M is BOMA\n(Building Owners & Managers Association).\nIn the design phase of the project, the facility manager and her technical staff will want to contribute information to the design\nteam\u2019s writing of the contract specification and, more specifically, to the following activities: service contracts, parts inventory, and\nas-built drawing requirements. Reviewing the design documents this O&M staff will want to be assured that equipment serviceability\nis adequate and safe (e.g., how does a maintenance technician access the roof to replace filters at the AHU?).\nFor a building program, not to mention for a business plan, to successfully manage a chain of movie theaters, it is imperative that\nthe program include an O&M budget in addition to the program\u2019s construction budget. Fifteen to 20% of the cost of a building is\nfirst cost, and the remaining 80% or more of the cost of ownership is in the O&M over the rest of the building\u2019s life.\nFor this January B2B, the project delivery method is design-bid-build, so the contractor and his subcontractors will not be involved\nin the design phase and not be able to contribute to the contract documents. In the construction phase, the facility manager\nand her technical staff will want to revisit the issues noted above during the design phase. Next comes the startup and commissioning\nphases, and the staff will want to be proactive in following along with the contractor\u2019s startup personnel and in receiving\nequipment training and system training using the O&M manuals and contract drawings (which will become the as-built drawings).", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Amanda Parolise [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Theatre design ; acoustics ; project startup", "Sumber": "amckew@yahoo.com.", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur \u00a0\n                                     Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Mei 2019"}
