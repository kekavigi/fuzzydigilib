{"Nomor": 36488, "Judul": "Closed-form solution of stress state and stability analysis of wellbore in anisotropic permeable rocks", "Abstrak": "This work aims to develop a closed-form solution of stress state around wellbore drilled in the anisotropic\npermeable rocks taking into account the transient effect of fluid flow. For this purpose, a simplified method was\nadopted to solve the anisotropic hydraulic diffusion equation. Knowing the explicit transient evolution of pore\npressure, the hydraulic and hydro-mechanical potentials were proposed through which stress state around\nwellbore are determined thanks to the use of the well-known complex potential approach. The validity of this\nclosed-form solution was verified by comparing with the result obtained from the numerical simulation. By\ncombining the analytical solution of stresses on well wall with a chosen anisotropic failure criterion of rock mass,\nthe stability analysis of wellbore was carried out. Through the parametric study, we elucidated the influence of\ndifferent factors on the safe mud pressure window notably the anisotropic poro-elastic properties, the anisotropic\nstrength of the rock masses as well as the anisotropic initial stress state and the inclined bedding plane of\nformation", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Duc-Phi Do [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Nam-Hung Tran , Hong-Lam Dang , Dashnor Hoxha"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Closed-form solution, Transient flow, Poro-elastic, Permeable rocks, Anisotropic strength, Mud pressure window, Wellbore stability", "Sumber": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrmms.2018.11.002", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Mar 2019"}
