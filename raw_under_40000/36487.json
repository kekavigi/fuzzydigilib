{"Nomor": 36487, "Judul": "Analytical and experimental investigation of pore pressure induced strain softening around boreholes", "Abstrak": "Changes in effective stress around a borehole due to pressure drop can cause formation instabilities leading to\nissues such as sand/solid production and wellbore stability. Analytical studies have been conducted in the past to\ngain insights into physical mechanisms involved in this complex process. The developed analytical solutions for\nsuch hydro-mechanical instability often consider perfectly plastic behaviour for the rock, whereas the field\nobservations suggest strong strain softening as a result of pore pressure drop. In addition, these analytical solutions are not verified with experimental data in many instances.\nIn this study, we developed a series of closed form solutions to predict the stress and strain changes around a\nborehole within poro-elasto-softening-plastic concept using Mohr Coulomb failure criterion. For the purpose of\ndescribing the pore pressure induced softening behaviour; an exponential function was used to relate the evolution of yield surface to plastic shear strain. In a further step, a series of hollow cylinder experiments were\nconducted on sandstone samples where different hydrostatic confinements at elevated pore pressures were\napplied. The hollow cylindrical samples were imaged before and after the experiments using 3D X-ray micro\nComputed Tomography technique (micro-CT) to precisely identify the collapsed-damaged and plastic zones\nformed around the borehole. Finally, the results from the experiments and micro-CT analysis were compared\nwith the model prediction and a good agreement was observed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Adelina Lv [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hamed Lamei Ramandi , Hossein Masoumi , Mohammad Saadatfar, Klaus Regenauer-Lieb, Hamid Roshan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Analytical solution, Pore pressure, Mohr Coulomb, Constitutive modelling, Sand production", "Sumber": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrmms.2018.11.001", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Mar 2019"}
