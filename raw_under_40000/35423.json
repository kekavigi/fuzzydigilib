The  college students  are  taken  as  experimental  subjects  and  influence produced  by  art  aesthetic  processing  through  the  behavioral  experiment  and  time-correlation  potentials experiment. The clarity, beauty and content availability of art works exert significant impact on the processing fluency of art works and the interaction effect among these three factors is significant. The higher the processing fluency  of works,  the  greater  the  aesthetic  preference  obtained.  The  aesthetic  preference  is  influenced  by  the processing fluency of art works. The higher the processing fluency, the higher the preference level. The clarity, beauty and content availability of art works all affect the processing fluency of works. The greater the beauty of works, the higher the processing fluency, and thus it can be recognized more quickly", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Feng Xue [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Psychological Mechanism of Art Aesthetic Processing , Behavioral Experiment, Event-related Potential  E xperiment", "Sumber": "NeuroQuantology | June 2018 | Volume 16 | Issue 6 |  Page 227-231 | doi: 10.14704/nq.2018.16.6.1673", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos \u00a0\n                                     Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Feb 2019"}
