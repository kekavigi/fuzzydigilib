Branding  \nof  the  country  begins  by  defining  the  strategy  of  promoting  products,  especially  export  brands,  since  the  development  of  high  quality  local  brands  and  their  presence  on  the  foreign  market  improves  the  image  of  the  country. According to the Anholt Nation Brands Index, which shows maps of the individuals responses to their perception along different dimensions in one index \nnumber,   one   dimension   of   the   Anholt`s   hexagon   is   and   export   regarding   customer`s perceptions and stereotypes about the products from that country. An econometric model was used in order to determine the export of plant products  from  40  countries  (the  data  presented  in  the  table  for  the  UN).  The  observed  period  was  from  2006  to  2015,  including  2006  and  2015.  The  test  article consisted 500 plant products divided into 100 sub-categories, marked with 4-digit and 10 categories marked with two figures. The data presented in the table are:  the share of exports of plant products in total exports, RCA, domestic credit to   private   sector   (%   of   GDP),   em\nployment   in   agriculture   (%   of   total   employment),  fertilizer  consumption  (kilograms  per  hectare  of  arable  land),  foreign  direct  investment,  net  inflows  (%  of  GDP),  GDP  growth  (annual  %),  GDP   per   capita   growth   (annual   %),   general   government   fil   consumption   \nexpenditure  (%  of  GDP),  gross  capital  formation  (%  of  GDP),  rural  population  (% of total population), time to export (days), trade (% of GDP). The  result  of  this  analysis,  with  the  use  of  mentioned  econometric  model  implies that if we increase the percentage of the population in rural areas to 1%, the  export  (plant  products)  of  the  country  in  total  export  will  be  reduced  by  \n0.027%. Given  that  increased  use  of  fertilizers  per  hectare  of  cultivated  land  by  \n1% share of the country's exports will increase by 0.009%. The  export,  regarding  plant  product,  is  adequate  component  for  branding  of country. But, for nation\u2019s recognition and for better positioning in the minds of consumers, attention should not be paid to increase the number of inhabitants in \nrural  areas, but  the  improvement  of  technology,  knowledge  and  application  of  research which will result with the growth plant product\u2019s export in total exports.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jelena Zurig [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mladen PERAZI? and Aleksandar KONATAR"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "branding,  plant  production,  export,   model,  country,  organic   product.", "Sumber": "Agriculture  &  Forestry, Vol.  63 Issue  2:  121-130 , 2017 , Podgorica", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Feb 2019"}
