{"Nomor": 38025, "Judul": "Monte Carlo Study of Lattice Compact Quantum Electrodynamics with Fermionic Matter: The Parent State of Quantum Phases", "Abstrak": "The interplay between lattice gauge theories and fermionic matter accounts for fundamental physical\nphenomena ranging from the deconfinement of quarks in particle physics to quantum spin liquid with\nfractionalized anyons and emergent gauge structures in condensedmatter physics.However, except for certain limits (for instance, a large number of flavors of matter fields), analytical methods can provide few concrete results. Here we show that the problem of compact U\u00f01\u00de lattice gauge theory coupled to fermionic matter in \u00f02 \u00fe 1\u00deD is possible to access via sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations. One can hence map out the phase diagramas a function of fermion flavors and the strength of gauge fluctuations. By increasing the coupling constant of the gauge field, gauge confinement in the form of various spontaneous-symmetrybreaking phases such as the valence-bond solid (VBS) and N\u00b4eel antiferromagnet emerge. Deconfined phases with algebraic spin and VBS correlation functions are also observed. Such deconfined phases are incarnations of exotic states of matter, i.e., the algebraic spin liquid, which is generally viewed as the parent state of various quantumphases. The phase transitions between the deconfined and confined phases, aswell as that between the different confined phases provide various manifestations of deconfined quantum criticality. In particular, for four flavorsNf \u00bc 4, our data suggest a continuous quantumphase transition between the VBS andN\u00b4eel order. We also provide preliminary theoretical analysis for these quantum phase transitions.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xiao Yan Xu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yang Qi,", "Long Zhang,", "Fakher F.
