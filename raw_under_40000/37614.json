{"Nomor": 37614, "Judul": "Use of code sensing technique in the receiver-based spreading code protocol and its performance analysis", "Abstrak": "Packet conflicts in an asynchronous distributed\nCDMA packet radio network is a main\ncause of throughput inefficiency and network\ninstability. To reduce the packet conflicts due to\nrandom packet initiations in the network an alternative\ncollision-avoiding CDMA protocol, the\nreceiver-based (R) spreading code sensing protocol,\nis proposed and its performance is numerically\nanalysed. The results reveal that, by using\nthe code-sensing technique in the conventional\nreceiver-based spreading code protocol, the\nthroughput-delay performance and the stability of\nthe network can be dramatically improved. The\nresults are also compared with those of other\nCDMA spreading code protocols without code\nsensing. A two-dimensional time-continuous\nMarkov chain model for the R code sensing protocol\nis developed to evaluate its steady-state performance", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "X.H.
