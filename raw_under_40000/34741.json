{"Nomor": 34741, "Judul": "Stress Corrosion Cracking Of L360ns Pipeline Steel In Sulfur Environment", "Abstrak": "Slow strain rate test (SSRT) and tensile fracture observation are applied to study the stress corrosion\ncracking (SCC) of L360NS pipeline steel. 5.0 wt. % sodium chloride solution containing elemental\nsulfur and 0.5 wt. % glacial acetic acid solution containing elemental sulfur are used. The results\nshow that brittle fracture mainly occurs on the samples in high sulfur environment. In the sulfur\nsuspension solution, the SCC sensitivity of L360NS pipeline steel increases along elemental sulfur\ncontent. In sulfur melting cladding condition, obvious corrosion can be observed with a large\namount of corrosion pits appearing on the gauge section of the sample. The corrosion products are\nFe1\u00fexS, black easily detached, and H2. In sulfur suspension and sulfur melting cladding conditions,\nstress oriented hydrogen induced cracking (SOHIC) is the main cracking, which is caused by the\njoint effect of SCC and hydrogen induced cracking (HIC).", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zhou Fan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiaogang Hu", "Jianyi Liu", "Hongchuan Li", "Jinwen Fu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Sour gas field, Elemental sulfur, SSRT, SCC", "Sumber": "Petroleum, Volume 3, Issue 3, 377-383 (September 2017)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Feb 2019"}
