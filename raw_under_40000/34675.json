{"Nomor": 34675, "Judul": "How Much Do You Know About The Methods For Determining Onset Of Asphaltene Precipitation?", "Abstrak": "One of the major problems in all area of petroleum industry, including production, operation,\nstorage and transportation, is formation of heavy organic compounds, e.g., asphaltene and wax, and\ntheir consequent deposition in equipment and pipelines. Change in crude oil composition, temperature and pressure leads to asphaltene precipitation. Thus, it is of vital importance to determine\nonset of asphaltene precipitation during oil production. In this regard, various techniques have\nbeen suggested in literature, each with its own pros and cons. However, from practical point of\nview, one needs to decide which method serves to be proper one. To this end, present study gives a\ncomprehensive critical review for different techniques serve to determine onset of asphaltene\nprecipitation along with comparing their advantages and disadvantages. Since each method presents its own definition for onset, such as onset of precipitation, clustering and deposition; it is\nnecessary to distinguish their difference based on underlying physical mechanisms. It was\nconcluded that mechanism of asphaltene precipitation for determining onset of asphaltene precipitation plays a substantial role.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mohammad Mahdi Shadman [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Amir Hossein Saeedi Dehaghani", "Mohammad Hasan Badizad"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Asphaltene, Precipitation, Flocculation, Clustering, Deposition", "Sumber": "Petroleum, Volume 3, Issue 4, 287-291 (September 2017), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2016.08.011", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Feb 2019"}
