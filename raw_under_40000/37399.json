{"Nomor": 37399, "Judul": "RESIDENTS\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd RISK PERCEPTION SURROUNDING MOUNT BROMO (A CASE STUDY IN TOSARI SUB-DISTRICT, PASURUAN DISTRICT, INDONESIA)", "Abstrak": "A volcano eruption is one of a geophysical natural phenomenon that can endanger\nhuman life especially people who live in disaster-prone areas. The danger of\nvolcano eruption came from volcanic ash, lava flow, sulfur gas and landslides which\ncan cause property damage, farmland damage, injuries, and casualties. Residents\nhazard preparedness can reduce the number of damage, injury, and casualties\ncaused by a volcano eruption. In many cases, hazard preparedness has relation with\nrisk perception because risk perception can influence and determine how people\nreact to certain risk and danger, especially danger that came from a volcano\neruption. Understanding residents risk perception can be useful for stakeholders in\nformulating disaster risk reduction strategy.\nMount Bromo is one of the mountains at Tengger mountain complex in Indonesia\nwhich has an active crater. The mountain is located in East Java Province and\nadministratively belongs to Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park (TN-BTS).\nMount Bromo is located in East Java Province, Indonesia with the highest point is\n2,329 m and the coordinates 7\u00b056'30\"SL 112\u00b057'00\"EL. Mount Bromo is active\nvolcano which is surrounded by sea sand and the crater can be climbed and visited\nand become a tourist attraction. There are four districts surrounding Bromo\nMountain which are Probolinggo, Pasuruan, Malang, and Lumajang. These four\ndistricts suffer the biggest impact when Bromo erupts and this research\nconcentrated only in Pasuruan District area. Tosari is a district in Pasuruan District\nwhich is located near Mount Bromo get impact from Bromo eruption directly.\nTosari district located at 7.30\u2019 \u2013 8.30\u2019 South Latitude and 112030\u2019 \u2013 113030\u2019 East\nLongitude with total area 85.73 km2. Tosari sub-district is one of the districts which\nis categorized as a district with high volcano eruption hazard in Pasuruan District\nThis research uses quantitative methods based on inductive approach. Inductive\napproach is used to determine the condition certain phenomena of people to develop\na general conclusion, therefore the research design is correlational research. The\nii\nCorrelation between different variables is used to determine the resident's risk\nperception and residents involvement in community activities which is related to\nhazard adjustment and involvement in the community. Correlation between\ndemographic characteristics such as gender, age and educational background with\nother variables are being analyzed using a statistical test to determine the\nsignificance of the variables. Questionnaire distribution to residents of Tosari\nresidents for collecting residents gender, age, education, hazard experiences,\ncommunity activities, disaster information, disaster training and hazard\npreparedness.\nMost residents had experience with volcano eruption more than one eruption time\nor year and eruption duration more than four weeks, but the highest impact of the\neruption is farmland damage and there were no property damage, family member\nloss or injured. There is a belief for people surrounding Mount Bromo that the\neruption never brings harm to people surrounding the mountain. Even though ash\nfall from the eruption brings damage to farmland, people believed that the ash will\nbring fertility to the farmland in years to come. Meanwhile, information about\ndisaster especially volcano activities is an important factor for resident surrounding\nMount Bromo, nevertheless not all residents have the willingness to collect disaster\ninformation initiative.\nRecognition and involvement in community activity are one of the variables which\nare influence residents risk perception. Tosari resident recognition on community\nmeeting is high, but residents\u2019 recognition on disaster discussion on community\nmeeting is low, on the other hand, recognition of the disaster-related community\nactivities is high. A resident of Tosari also have low participation on disaster\nresponse training even though recognition on the training not so low, this situation\ninfluence by local belief about eruption do not bring harm. Furthermore, most\nresidents confess that they have knowledge of action need to take when the eruption\nhappens even though residents have low recognition and low participation in\ndisaster response training. As part of hazard preparedness, residents also confess\nthat they also have knowledge if living in evacuation shelter although not all\nresidents have the willingness to move temporarily to evacuation shelter when\nvolcano eruption happens.\nIn conclusion, demographic characteristics related with risk perception and even\nthough there is a relationship between demographic characteristic and risk\nperception, not all demographic characteristic have a correlation with variables that\ninfluence risk perception", "Daftar File": {"2018_TS_PP_DAVID_OKTARIAWAN_1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164346", "2018_TS_PP_DAVID_OKTARIAWAN_1-BAB_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164347", "2018_TS_PP_DAVID_OKTARIAWAN_1-BAB_2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164348", "2018_TS_PP_DAVID_OKTARIAWAN_1-BAB_3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164349", "2018_TS_PP_DAVID_OKTARIAWAN_1-BAB_4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164350", "2018_TS_PP_DAVID_OKTARIAWAN_1-BAB_5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164351", "2018_TS_PP_DAVID_OKTARIAWAN_1-BAB_6.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164352", "2018_TS_PP_DAVID_OKTARIAWAN_1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164353"}, "Penulis": "David Oktariawan [25415038]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Saut Aritua Hasiholan Sagala, S.T., M.Sc."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Perencanaan Wilayah dan Kota", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Arsitektur, Perencanaan dan Pengembangan Kebijakan", "Subjek": "Area planning", "Kata Kunci": "risk, perception, Bromo, resident, volcano, eruption, disaster.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "8 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Mar 2019"}
