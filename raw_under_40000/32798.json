{"Nomor": 32798, "Judul": "Non-Linear Singular Integral Representation For Petroleum Reservoir Engineering", "Abstrak": "A new mathematical model is proposed in order to determine the properties of the reservoir materials, when oil reserves are moving through porous media, which is a very important problem of petroleum\nreservoir engineering. Thus, the above problem is reduced to the solution of a non-linear singular integral\nequation, which is numerically evaluated by using the singular integral operators method (SIOM). Also, several properties of the porous medium equation, which is a Helmholtz differential equation, are analyzed and\ninvestigated. An application is finally given for a well testing to be checked when an heterogeneous oil reservoir\nis moving in a porous medium. By using the SIOM, the pressure response from the well test conducted in the\nabove heterogeneous oil reservoir is calculated.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "E. G.
