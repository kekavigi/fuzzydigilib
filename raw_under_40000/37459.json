{"Nomor": 37459, "Judul": "Radiofrequency-Sensitive Longitudinal Relaxation Tuning StrategyEnabling the Visualization of Radiofrequency Ablation Intensified byMagnetic Composite", "Abstrak": "As a minimally invasive heat source, radiofrequency (RF)ablation still encounters potential damages to the surrounding normaltissues because of heat diffusion, high power, and long time. With acomprehensive understanding of the current state of the art on RFablation, a magnetic composite using porous hollow iron oxidenanoparticles (HIONs) as carriers to loadDL-menthol (DLM) hasbeen engineered. This composite involves two protocols for enhancingRF ablation, that is, HION-mediated magnetothermal conversion in RFfield and RF solidoid vaporation (RSV)-augmented inertial cavitation,respectively. A combined effect based on two protocols is found toimprove energy transformation, and further, along with hydrophobicDLM-impeded heat diffusion, improve the energy utilization efficiencyand significantly facilitate ex vivo and in vivo RF ablation. Moresignificantly, in vitro and in vivo RSV processes and RSV-augmentedinertial cavitation for RF ablation can be monitored byT1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) via an RF-sensitivelongitudinal relaxation tuning strategy because the RSV process can deplete DLM and make HION carriers permeable to watermolecules, consequently improving the longitudinal relaxation rate of HIONs and enhancingT1-weighted MRI. Therefore,this RF-sensitive magnetic composite holds a great potential in lowering the power and time of RF ablation and improving itstherapeutic safety", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Yan_Fang_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164505"}, "Penulis": "Yan Fang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hong-Yan Li,Hao-Hao Yin,Shi-Hao Xu,Wei-Wei Ren,Shi-Si Ding,Wei-Zhong Tang,Li-Hua XiangRong Wu,Xin Guan,Kun Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "inertial cavitation, magnetothermal effect, longitudinal relaxation tuning, T1-weighted MRI monitoring,radiofrequency ablation", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
