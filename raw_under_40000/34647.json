{"Nomor": 34647, "Judul": "Attention web designers: You have 50 milliseconds to make a good first impression!", "Abstrak": "Three studies were conducted to ascertain how quickly people form an opinion about web\npage visual appeal. In the first study, participants twice rated the visual appeal of web\nhomepages presented for 500 ms each. The second study replicated the first, but participants\nalso rated each web page on seven specific design dimensions. Visual appeal was found to be\nclosely related to most of these. Study 3 again replicated the 500 ms condition as well as\nadding a 50ms condition using the same stimuli to determine whether the first impression\nmay be interpreted as a \u2018mere exposure effect\u2019 (Zajonc 1980). Throughout, visual appeal\nratings were highly correlated from one phase to the next as were the correlations between\nthe 50 ms and 500 ms conditions. Thus, visual appeal can be assessed within 50 ms,\nsuggesting that web designers have about 50 ms to make a good first impression.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "GITTE LINDGAARD  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["GARY FERNANDES, CATHY DUDEK  and J.
