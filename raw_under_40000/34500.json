It is important to investigate\nthe mapping relationship betweenproduct form elements and corresponding kansei qualities\nin order to design  product those meet different  types  of customers\u2019 subjective impressions.\nIn  this  paper, the authors established  kansei quality evaluation  criteria of product  forms  and \npresented a  new  kansei quality prediction method of product form design which introduced quantification theory type II to model the Form-kansei quality mapping relationship.\nFinally, the authors  gave the implementation procedures of kansei quality prediction model in detail.\nThe proposed method is adapted to kansei quality prediction for the majority of consumer products form design.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zhiyong Xiong  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yingxin Weng, Li jun Jiang and  Liu qing Ruan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Kansei Quality; Prediction Method ; Form  Design ; Quantification Theory", "Sumber": "Applied Mechanics & Materials. 2014, Issue 548-549, p1922-1927. 6p", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Feb 2019"}
