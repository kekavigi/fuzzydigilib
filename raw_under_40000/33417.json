{"Nomor": 33417, "Judul": "MantaRay: A Novel Autonomous Sampling Instrument for In Situ Measurements of Environmental Microplastic Particle Concentrations", "Abstrak": "Presented here is the initial hardware and\nsoftware design of a prototype autonomous microplastic\nsampling instrument. Microplastics are defined as particles of\nplastic < 5 mm greatest dimension. They are becoming pervasive\nin the world ocean due to anthropogenic pollution. The ocean has\nspatially variable concentrations of surface microplastics, so\nattempting to identify trends in global dispersal patterns is\ndifficult and expensive using current research techniques.\nUnderstanding the global dispersion patterns and degradation\nrates of microplastics will help to uncover the associated human\nand ecosystem impacts. A novel low-cost oceanographic sensor\nhas been developed that can determine the concentration of\nmarine microplastics over large spatial areas. This sensor can\nremove plastic particulates from seawater and archive them for\nlater analysis, determine microplastic concentrations for 28\ndiscrete samples recording GPS position, and simultaneously\nmeasure salinity and water temperature. This sensor has been\ndesigned around the open-source Arduino platform, allowing for\nmaximum implementation of additional sensors and systems in\nfuture prototypes. The MantaRay sensor can be implemented on\na drifter, mooring, or Autonomous Underwater Vehicle to gather\ndiverse data on the dispersion of microplastics. This sensor could\ndrastically cut research costs associated with studying deep-sea\nmicroplastic concentrations and increase our understanding of\nplastic dispersion and degradation rates in marine ecosystems.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ethan C.
