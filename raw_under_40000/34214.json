{"Nomor": 34214, "Judul": "Construction of the  Discipline System of Art Theory under  the Concept of Major Discipline", "Abstrak": "In recent years, with the more refined and professional pursuit of art works by the masses, the \neducation of art \ntheory has attracted more and more attention. The demand of the society for high\n-\nlevel art talents has become \nmore  and  more  intense  and  construction  of  the  discipline  system  of  art  theory  has  become  more  and  more \nimportant.  The  constructio\nn  is  even  more  important.  In  view  of  the  teaching  difficulty  brought  by  short \ndevelopment  time,  multi\n-\ndisciplinary  and  weak  foundation  of  domestic  art  education,  this  paper  proposes  a \nteaching  plan  integrating  MOOC  concept  under  the  perspective  of  major  di\nscipline.  The  construction  and \nimplementation of this plan can greatly expand the professional depth and breadth of teachers and students and \nstimulate the learning interest of students so as to develop their autonomous learning ability. The practice has \nroved that the proposed scheme can complement the deficiencies in the current teaching system and improve \nthe construction of art discipline system in colleges and universities.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yongfei Huang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "A rt  Theory \u2022  A utonomous  Learning \u2022  D iscipline  System  Construction \u2022  MOOC  Conce", "Sumber": "Arts and Communications college of Anhui University", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Feb 2019"}
