{"Nomor": 37651, "Judul": "Effect of collagen-induced residual stress on the frictional property of articular cartilage", "Abstrak": "Previous findings, such as split-line of the articular cartilage surface and curving of sliced cartilage specimen, would suggest that residual stress is contained in articular cartilage. This study was performed to determine the effect of collagen fibre-induced residual stress on the biphasic lubrication property of articular cartilage. A fibre-reinforced poroelastic model of articular cartilage was developed in Abaqus. In the model, residual stress was contained in the collagen fibre in the surface layer by applying 1\u20135% of tensile strain. Reciprocating friction analysis was performed between the model and a sphere at a friction speed of 1.0\u201310.0 mm/s. Results revealed that the coefficients of start-up and dynamic friction at second friction cycle were lower in residual stress model than in no-residual stress model, with the largest decreases observed at a friction speed of 1 mm/s. It was observed that rehydration was promoted in the bearing area in residual stress model. These results suggest that collagen-induced residual stress plays an important role in enhancing the biphasic lubrication property of articular cartilage.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hiromichi Fujie [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sou Morishita, Seido Yarimitsu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "fractional derivative, collagen", "Sumber": "Biosurface and Biotribology IET JOURNALS", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Apr 2019"}
