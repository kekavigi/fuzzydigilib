{"Nomor": 36869, "Judul": "A novel operational strategy to enhance wastewater treatment with dual-anode assembled microbial desalination cell", "Abstrak": "This study introduced a novel dual-anode assembled microbial desalination cell to enhance the performance\nof domestic wastewater treatment. Two parallel units were fabricated with two anodes and one cathode,\nwhich is separated by two ion exchange membrane stacks. A hollow fiber membrane module was inserted in\nthe cathode to intercept suspended solids and microbes. Based on preliminary experiments where synthetic\nwastewater was utilized, anode hydraulic retention time of 10 h and cathode aeration rate of 0.16 m3/h were\nchosen as the operating conditions. By innovatively connecting four membrane stacks in cascades, which multiplied\nflowratewithout adding extra circulation pumps, the desalination rate of the systemwas improved 214.8%\ncompared with single membrane stack mode. When modified domestic wastewater was applied, the average\nremoval efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand, ammonia nitrogen, total nitrogen and total phosphorous\nreached 96.9%, 99.0%, 98.0% and 98.3%, respectively", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Fubin Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Lisheng Wang.,Kuichang Zuo.,Shuai Luo.,Xiaoyuan Zhang.,Peng Liang.,Xia Huang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Microbial desalination cell Wastewater treatment Operational strategy", "Sumber": "Bioelectrochemistry 126 (2019) 99\u2013104", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Mar 2019"}
