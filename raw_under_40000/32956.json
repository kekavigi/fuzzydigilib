It is hard to imagine how anyone who has seen these images could not be both impressed by the achievement and excited by what the images and other data reveal. One of the big surprises1 was that Pluto\u2019s atmosphere is much colder than predicted2 at altitudes above 50 kilometres. Because temperature profiles are fundamental to understanding the physics of planetary atmospheres, scientists have been compelled to determine whether key atmospheric processes were missed in earlier studies. On page 352, Zhang et al.3 come to the remarkable conclusion that haze particles, rather than\ngas molecules, control Pluto\u2019s atmospheric temperature.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ROBERT A.
