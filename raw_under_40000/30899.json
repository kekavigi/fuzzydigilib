{"Nomor": 30899, "Judul": "WATER QUALITY RESTORATION THROUGH HORIZONTAL SUBSURFACE CONSTRUCTED WETLAND (CASE STUDY: CENGKARENG DRAIN, JAKARTA)", "Abstrak": "Population growth resulted in an increased volume of water demand for using in daily activities. Increasing the number of habitants was not match with amount of water resources. The new source of water such as water reclamation is needed. Therefor required wastewater treatment which is easy, inexpensive, efficient and effective. Constructed wetland is planned or controlled processing system is designed as natural wetland involving wetland vegetation, media and microorganisms for treating wastewater. Iris martinicesis which is similar with Iris psedacorus and Spathiphyllum wallisii were used as wetland vegetation. This study aims to increase the quality of Cengkareng Drain stream water using a lab scale reactor. Reactors were operated from October 2015 to February 2016 with variation of hydraulic retention time (HRT) 1 day, 2 days, and 3 days, with both types of plants as comparison. In this study, two kind of water was used (artificial and real water), while artificial water\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s concentration was made dependent on real water with concentration COD was 90 mg/L, total solid 55 mg/L, total nitrogen 12.4 mg/L, and total phosphate 0.78 mg/L. The maximum COD removal efficiency (91.11%) occurred in all HRT with both reactors. The highest TSS removal efficiency (98.22%) occurred in HRT 1 day in Iris martinicesis reactor and (86.77%) in Spathiphyllum wallisii reactor. The highest removal efficiency of total nitrogen (94.68%) in Irismartinicensi reactor, occurred in HRT 3 days, while Spathiphyllum wallisii reactor (94.68%) occurred in HRT 1day. The highest removal efficiency of total phosphate (98.354%) in Iris martinicensis reactor, occurred in HRT 1 day, while Spathipyllum wallisii reactor (97.648%). Kinetic removal of COD is 0.0012/day by Iris martinicensis, HRT 1 day, while BOD is 0.0016/day by Spathiphyllum wallisii, HRT 3 days. In general, the Iris martinicensis planted reactor could perform pollutants removal efficiency as well as Spatiphyllum wallisii planted reactor and can improve water quality to meet the quality standards.", "Daftar File": {"2016 TS PP SEYHA CHHIM 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/140020", "2016 TS PP SEYHA CHHIM 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/140021", "2016 TS PP SEYHA CHHIM 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/140022", "2016 TS PP SEYHA CHHIM 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/140023", "2016 TS PP SEYHA CHHIM 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/140024", "2016 TS PP SEYHA CHHIM 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/140025", "2016 TS PP SEYHA CHHIM 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/140026"}, "Penulis": "SEYHA CHHIM (NIM: 25314759)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing :  \n\nProf.Dr-Ing.Ir.Prayatni Soewondo,MS", "Ir.Yuniati,M.T.,M.Sc.,PhD"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Lingkungan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Sipil dan Lingkungan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "constructed wetland, hydraulic retention time, removal efficiency", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Alice D", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Sep 2018"}
