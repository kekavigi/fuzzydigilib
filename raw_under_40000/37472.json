{"Nomor": 37472, "Judul": "Transient Supersolid Properties in an Array of Dipolar Quantum Droplets", "Abstrak": "We study theoretically and experimentally the emergence of supersolid properties in a dipolar BoseEinstein condensate. The theory reveals a ground state phase diagram with three distinct regimes\u2014a regular Bose-Einstein condensate and incoherent and coherent arrays of quantum droplets. The coherent droplets are connected by a background condensate, which leads\u2014in addition to the periodic density modulation\u2014to a robust phase coherence throughout the whole system. We further theoretically demonstrate that we are able to dynamically approach the ground state in our experiment and that its lifetime is limited only by three-body losses. Experimentally we probe and confirm the signatures of the phase diagram by observing the in situ density modulation as well as the phase coherence using matter wave interference.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Fabian B\u00f6ttcher [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jan-Niklas Schmidt,", "Matthias Wenzel,", "Jens Hertkorn,", "Mingyang Guo,", "Tim Langen,", "and Tilman Pfau"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW X9,011051 (2019), Published by the American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Mar 2019"}
