{"Nomor": 36333, "Judul": "An improved multi-objective topology optimization approach for tensegrity structures", "Abstrak": "This article presents an improved approach for topology optimization of tensegrity structures. The ground structure method is used\nto model the topology optimization problem of tensegrity structures into a mixed integer linear programming formulation. To improve\nthe controllability of the found tensegrity structure, the nodes, besides the members, of the ground structure are treated as optimiza-\ntion variables, and direct and customized controls on the must-be-used nodes and on the number of struts connecting to each node\nare realized. A multi-objective function combining the previously used single objectives and a new developed single objective by weight\ncoefficients is proposed to consider the multi-requirement on different aspects of tensegrity structures. Numerical examples are car-\nried out to verify the proposed approach.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xian Xu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yafeng Wang and Yaozhi Luo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "ground structure method, mixed integer linear programming, multi-objective, tensegrity, topology optimization", "Sumber": "Advances in Structural Engineering 2018, Vol. 21(1) 59\u201370", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur \u00a0\n                                     Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Mar 2019"}
