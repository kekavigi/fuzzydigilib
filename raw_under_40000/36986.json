{"Nomor": 36986, "Judul": "VERNACULAR ARCHITECTURE AND IDENTITY. TRADITIONAL ULA HOUSES, TURKEY", "Abstrak": "Vernacular architecture, bearing the physical and socio-cultural characteristics of its in-situ\nenvironment and conveying thousands of years of accumulation and tradition, emerged from the hands of\nlocal building masters. While regional architecture is very extrinsic, it exhibits the character of an anonymous\narchitect and is the clearest reflection of the local community\u2019s traditions, culture, experience and customs.\nBehind it lies ancient knowledge, experience, skill and mastery that is passed down from generation to\ngeneration. It pertains to the vernacular architecture user\u2019s lifestyle, identity and area of production which\nresponds to its in-situ needs and has qualities that are peculiar to the region. The local architecture is a\ndirect and unconscious transformation of community culture into material within the context of certain needs.\nDeriving from tradition, it is passed down from generation to generation as the community\u2019s social and\ncultural documents. The goal of this article is to introduce, in terms of plan typology, general features and\ninterior decoration, examples of regional housing units utilized by Turks living in Mu?la\u2019s provincial district of\nUla, one of the imporant regions of Anatolia featuring traditional vernacular architecture.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Alev ERARSLAN [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "cultural heritage, vernacular architecture, traditional houses, identity, Turkey.", "Sumber": "PRO LIGNO Vol. 14 No. 3 2018 www.proligno.ro pp. 36-49", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Mar 2019"}
