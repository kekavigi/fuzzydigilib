{"Nomor": 37458, "Judul": "Biodegradable Poly(ester-co-acrylate) with Antifoulant PendantGroups for Marine Anti-Biofouling", "Abstrak": "Polymer resins are critical for marine anti-biofouling coatings. Inthis study, degradable poly(ester-co-acrylate) with antifoulant pendant groups hasbeen prepared by the radical ring-opening polymerization of 2-methylene-1,3-dioxepane, methyl methacrylate, andN-methacryloyloxy methyl benzoisothiazo-linone. Such a polymer containing main-chain esters can hydrolytically andenzymatically degrade. Both degradation rates increase with main-chain estercontent. Moreover, since the antifoulant groups are chemically grafted to thedegradable main chain, their release can be controlled by the degradation besidesthe hydrolysis of side groups. Our study shows that the copolymer coating isefficient in inhibiting the accumulation of marine bacterial biofilm ofPseudomonassp. and diatomNavicular incerta. Marinefield test reveals that the copolymer hasexcellent efficiency in preventing biofouling for more than 6 months", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Guoxiong_Dai_1_.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164504"}, "Penulis": "Guoxiong Dai, [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Qingyi Xie, Chunfeng Ma,Guangzhao Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "poly(ester-co-acrylate), polymeric antifoulant, degradation, radical ring-opening polymerization, marine anti-biofouling", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
