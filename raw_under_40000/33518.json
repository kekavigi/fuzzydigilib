{"Nomor": 33518, "Judul": "Geological And Geophysical Analyses Of The Diferent Reasons For Dhi Failure Case In The Nile Delta Pliocene Section", "Abstrak": "The shallow clastic section in the Nile Delta is characterized by mild velocity variations. The relationship between the\nexpected velocity reduction in the gas reservoir rocks and the encompassing shale is responsible for acoustic impedance contrast, predictable to a particular AVO-class. In class-3AVO, the bright spot is a result of great reduction in velocity increase\ndue to diferences between high-velocity encompassing shale and relatively low-velocity reservoir sand. The class-3AVO\ncharacterizes a strong seismic amplitude appearance in the full stack section and with similar characteristic view of AVO\nanalysis and interpretation. In addition to the strong amplitude, there are diferent DHI features related to the gas occurrence. These DHI features are analyzed to achieve and deliver a successful exploratory well. The DHI analysis of one of the\nunsuccessful cases using recent 3-D seismic data clarifes the importance of the workfow that works for exploring types\nof anomalies in the Nile Delta. The anomaly is drilled mainly based on an explicit high-amplitude anomaly with local fat\nspot, but without taking into consideration the extent of DHI characteristics, inherent to gas occurrence in the Nile Delta.\nAuthors investigate all the features related to this unproven case in the form of a postmortem and compare it with proven\nexisting discoveries, to know the possible reason of unsuccessful DHI anomalies in the Nile Delta.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SAID HANAFY [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Khamis Farhood, Sharaf Eldin Mahmoud, Shastri Nimmagadda,  Walid M.
