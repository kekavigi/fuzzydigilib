{"Nomor": 38139, "Judul": "Operating theatre design", "Abstrak": "In the past 300 years, the design of operation rooms and\ntheir ancillary spaces has responded to changes in surgical\nneeds and practice. At one time, operations were\nundertaken on hospital wards, in patients\u2019 homes, and in\ndoctors\u2019 consulting rooms. But in the 18th century the\ndemonstration and teaching of surgery became\nimportant, so dedicated rooms for surgical operations\nwere built. They were designed as theatres with\naccommodation for spectators\u2014based on the old\nanatomy theatres\u2014such as the one established at St\nThomas\u2019 Hospital, London, in 1751.1 Prof James\nSimpson recorded in 18472 an operation attended by \u201ca\nlarge collection of professional gentlemen and students\u201d,\nand in his survey of hospitals and asylums in 1893 Henry\nBurdett noted3 \u201cin many large hospitals two, and\nsometimes three, operation rooms are provided, one\nbeing arranged in the form of a theatre, and provided\nwith accommodation for a considerable number of\nstudents\u201d. In the UK, rooms in which operations are\ndone continue to be called theatres; a few were built with\nviewing galleries in the 1960s, but the galleries have been\nsuperseded by facilities for relaying television images to\nlecture theatres.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Michael Essex-Lopresti [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Theatre design", "Sumber": "THE LANCET \u2022 Vol 353 \u2022 March 20, 1999", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Mei 2019"}
