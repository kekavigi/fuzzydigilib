{"Nomor": 35907, "Judul": "COMPLETE INITIAL VALUE SPACETIMES CONTAINING BLACK HOLES IN GENERALRELATIVITY: APPLICATION TO BLACK HOLE-DISK SYSTEMS", "Abstrak": "We present a new initial data formulation to solve the full set of Einstein equations for spacetimes that\ncontain a black hole under general conditions. The method can be used to construct complete initial data for spacetimes (the full metric) that contain a black hole. Contrary to most current studies the formulation\nrequires minimal assumptions. For example, rather than imposing the form of the spatial conformal metric\nwe impose 3 gauge conditions adapted to the coordinates describing the system under consideration. For stationary, axisymmetric spacetimes our method yields Kerr-Schild black holes in vacuum and rotating equilibrium neutron stars. We demonstrate the power of our new method by solving for the first time the whole system of Einstein equations for a nonaxisymmetric, self-gravitating torus in the presence of a black hole. The black hole has dimensionless spin Jbh=M2 bh \u00bc 0.9918, a rotation axis tilted at a 30\u00b0 angle with respect to the angular momentum of the disk, and a mass of ?1=5 of the disk.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ANTONIOS TSOKAROS [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["KOJI URYU,", "AND STUART L.
