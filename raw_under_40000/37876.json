{"Nomor": 37876, "Judul": "Parks, Malls, and  The Art of War", "Abstrak": "In the post-war years, Americans migrated en masse into suburbs punctuated  by  shopping  centers  that  served  as  social  and  recreational  hubs.  Concerned about the civic wellbeing of shopping-centered suburbanites, a group called the Agora Coalition formed in the 1990s to enhance malls\u2019 \ncivic functioning through a combination of design and programming strategies. This paper presents an adversarial alternative to such an approach. Rather than working \u201cwith\u201d the mall as its prodding civic conscience, the paper  recommends  strategizing  \u201cagainst\u201d  it  on  behalf  of  civic  life.  The  \npaper reveals four vulnerabilities in malls that such thinking can exploit: mall users may not find malls ego-enhancing places in which to socialize; the current economic recession has pointed up that many mall goods are  frivolous  nonessentials;  malls  are  less  likely  to  engender  topophilia  than are local public landscapes; and, as successful retail institutions in a competitive capitalist environment, malls employ successful strategies for gaining customers that designers of civic spaces can emulate. Indeed, the adversarial,  zero-sum  approach  recommended  here  exemplifies  the  use  of market-honed, \u201cmall\u201d strategizing. To nurture such thinking, I refer to Sun-Tzu\u2019s classic treatise The Art of War. The 2,400-year old text is required reading in MBA programs nationwide and presumably informs the thinking of many who build and manage malls. What would these people do if they were now competing against their creations on behalf of civic life?", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ronald A.
