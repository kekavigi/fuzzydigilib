{"Nomor": 38453, "Judul": "Nano-Fe0 Encapsulated in Microcarbon Spheres: Synthesis, Characterization, and Environmental Applications", "Abstrak": "Nanoscaled zerovalent iron (ZVI) encapsulated in\ncarbon spheres (nano-Fe0\n@CS) were prepared via a hydrothermal\ncarbonization method, using glucose and iron(III) nitrate as\nprecursors. The properties of the nano-Fe0\n@CS were investigated\nby X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis-differential\nscanning calorimetry (TGA-DSC), Fourier transform infrared\nspectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM),\ntransmission electron microscopy (TEM), and nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms. Nano-Fe0\n@CS was demonstrated, for\nthe first time, as an effective material in activating Oxone\n(peroxymonosulfate, PMS) for the oxidation of organic pollutants. It was found that the efficiency of nano-Fe0\n@CS was\nhigher than ZVI particles, iron ions, iron oxides, and a cobalt oxide. The mechanism of the high performance was discussed. The\nstructure of the nano-Fe0\n@CS not only leads to high efficiency in the activation of PMS, but also good stability. This study\nextended the application of ZVI from reductive destruction of organics to oxidative degradation of organics by providing a green\nmaterial for environmental remediation.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJNRL PP Haijian Huang 1.pdf?_": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/169735"}, "Penulis": "Hongqi Sun [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Guanliang Zhou,Shizhen Liu, Ha Ming Ang, Moses O Tade,Shaobin Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "zerovalent iron, peroxymonosulfate, carbon nanosphere, phenol, nanoparticles, chemical oxidation", "Sumber": "www.acsami.org", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Mei 2019"}
