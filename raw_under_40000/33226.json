{"Nomor": 33226, "Judul": "Bioavailability and effects of microplastics on marine zooplankton: A review", "Abstrak": "Microplastics are abundant and widespread in the marine environment. They are a contaminant of global\nenvironmental and economic concern. Due to their small size a wide range of marine species, including\nzooplankton can ingest them. Research has shown that microplastics are readily ingested by several\nzooplankton taxa, with associated negative impacts on biological processes. Zooplankton is a crucial food\nsource for many secondary consumers, consequently this represents a route whereby microplastic could\nenter the food web and transfer up the trophic levels. In this review we aim to: 1) evaluate the current\nknowledge base regarding microplastic ingestion by zooplankton in both the laboratory and the field;\nand 2) summarise the factors which contribute to the bioavailability of microplastics to zooplankton.\nCurrent literature shows that microplastic ingestion has been recorded in 39 zooplankton species from\n28 taxonomic orders including holo- and meroplanktonic species. The majority of studies occurred under\nlaboratory conditions and negative effects were reported in ten studies (45%) demonstrating effects on\nfeeding behaviour, growth, development, reproduction and lifespan. In contrast, three studies (14%)\nreported no negative effects from microplastic ingestion. Several physical and biological factors can influence the bioavailability of microplastics to zooplankton, such as size, shape, age and abundance. We\nidentified that microplastics used in experiments are often different to those quantified in the marine\nenvironment, particularly in terms of concentration, shape, type and age. We therefore suggest that\nfuture research should include microplastics that are more representative of those found in the marine\nenvironment at relevant concentrations. Additionally, investigating the effects of microplastic ingestion\non a broader range of zooplankton species and life stages, will help to answer key knowledge gaps\nregarding the effect of microplastic on recruitment, species populations and ultimately broader economic\nconsequences such as impacts on shell- and finfish stocks.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zara L.R.
