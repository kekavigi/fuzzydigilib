{"Nomor": 38944, "Judul": "The effect of flaw filling material on the compressive behaviour of 3D printed rock-like discs", "Abstrak": "The effect of flaw filling material on the deformation and failure behaviour of 3D printed rock-like Brazilian discs\nwith pre-existing flaws is investigated by quasi-static compressive loading test combined with digital image\ncorrelation (DIC) technique. In particular, a number of specimens with various flaw and bridge inclination angles\nand overlapping features are designed by computer aided design (CAD) and 3D printed. Crack initiation and\npropagation in the loaded specimens are studied and coalescence types of these flaws are identified by DIC\nanalysis. The results indicate that filling material imposes strong impacts on the deformation behaviour of\nspecimens and the resulting crack patterns are different from those with open flaws. It is revealed that filling the\nflaws with gypsum and clay mixture improves the strength characteristics of the specimens with significantly\nenhanced peak loads. Furthermore, DIC results indicate that in the single filled flaws inclined at 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0 and 75\u00b0\nnormal to the loading direction, the shear cracking first develops in the filling and then tensile cracks appear\nfrom the flaw tips. It is observed that the filled specimens develop much larger fracture process zone prior to the\npeak load. Moreover, when the specimens develop a crack inside the fillings, the enhancement of the peak load is\nremarkably larger than that of the filled specimens without cracking in the fillings. Overall this study has demonstrated not only the advantages of 3D printing combined with DIC method in rock deformation and crack\nstudy, but also the significant impacts of the flaw filling on the deformation and mechanical behaviour of rocklike material.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mansour Sharafisafa [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Luming Shen, Yonggang Zheng, Jianzhuang Xiao"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Rock-like material, Filled flaws 3D printed specimens, Crack propagation, Digital image correlation, Deformation analysis", "Sumber": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrmms.2019.03.031", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani \u00a0\n                                     Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Jun 2019"}
