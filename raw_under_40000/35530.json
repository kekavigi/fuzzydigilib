{"Nomor": 35530, "Judul": "SHAPING ELECTRON WAVE FUNCTIONS IN A CARBON NANOTUBE WITH A PARALLEL MAGNETIC FIELD", "Abstrak": "A magnetic field, through its vector potential, usually causes measurable changes in the electron wave\nfunction only in the direction transverse to the field. Here, we demonstrate experimentally and theoretically\nthat, in carbon nanotube quantum dots combining cylindrical topology and bipartite hexagonal lattice,\na magnetic field along the nanotube axis impacts also the longitudinal profile of the electronic states. With\nthe high (up to 17 T) magnetic fields in our experiment, the wave functions can be tuned all the way from a\n\u201chalf-wave resonator\u201d shape with nodes at both ends to a \u201cquarter-wave resonator\u201d shape with an antinode\nat one end. This in turn causes a distinct dependence of the conductance on the magnetic field. Our results\ndemonstrate a new strategy for the control of wave functions using magnetic fields in quantum systems\nwith a nontrivial lattice and topology.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "M.
