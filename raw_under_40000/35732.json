{"Nomor": 35732, "Judul": "Mapping palaeolakes in the T\ufffd\ufffdn\ufffd\ufffdr\ufffd\ufffd Desert of northeastern Niger using space-borne data for groundwater potential", "Abstrak": "Groundwater resources in arid lands are crucial for supporting life. Thus, delineation of low land areas,\nwhere surface runoff accumulated during pluvial periods assists in groundwater explorations.\nTherefore, the drainage patterns in northeastern Niger using various sources of DEMs of optical\n(ASTER) and radar (SRTM) satellite data were extracted. These data reveal three palaeolakes in the\nT\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 Desert. In addition, the DEMs together with the optical and radar satellite data were used to define\na major watershed measuring 634,000 km2. This watershed may have led to the formation of one major\npalaeolake as an ancestor of the three palaeolakes. The latter extend to 11,514 km2, 17,571 km2 and\n18,453 km2. The optical and radar satellites images show that the boundaries of these three lakes have\nbeen modified by extensive longitudinal and transverse sand dunes of considerable thickness. These\ndunes accumulated during a much later arid episode in geologic time, probably during the late\nQuaternary. Prior to that, the former marshlands received water from the Tibesti Mountains of northern\nChad, the Ahaggar Plateau of southeastern Algeria and the Air Mountain of northern Niger. The drainage\npatterns clearly show the pathway of water down to the ground level. The longest drainage line is emanating\nfrom the Ahaggar Plateau and extends south west for 837 km. The water overflow of the southernmost\nlake led to the formation of another distinct drainage line, leading to the southwestern edge of the\nancestral Megalake Chad. This drainage line begins in the vicinity of the town of Fachi and extends southward\nthrough the town of Dillia as a single tributary, and is here named the Dillia Palaeoriver. These\nobservations, which are based on the study of satellite data require geophysical fieldwork to ascertain\nthe interpretations, and evaluate the potential for groundwater accumulation in the region", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Gloria Molina  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ahmed Gaber, Farouk El-Baz"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "DEMs Optical and radar images Palaeolakes Groundwater", "Sumber": "NRIAG Journal of Astronomy and Geophysics 6 (2017) 395\u2013407, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrjag.2017.10.001", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Mar 2019"}
