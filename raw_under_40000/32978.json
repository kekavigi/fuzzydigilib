{"Nomor": 32978, "Judul": "Fluid Flow With Compaction And Sand Production In Unconsolidated Sandstone Reservoir", "Abstrak": "The fluid flow of unconsolidated sandstone reservoir can be affected by compaction and sand production\nwhich will damage the reservoir and affect oil well productivity. This study aims to measure how the two\nfactors affect the fluid flow. Firstly, single-phase displacement test was applied to investigate how the\npermeability changed with compaction. Then two-phase displacement test assessed the influence of\ncompaction on oil production. Finally, the characteristics of fluid flow with compaction and sand production were studied under different water content. The results demonstrate that the reduction of\npermeability with compaction is irreversible, which will result in lower productivity. In contrast, sand\nproduction can increase the permeability at mid and high water content, which slows down the decline\nof oil production. Generally, the oil well productivity is reduced because of compaction even with sand\nproduction, especially when the formation pressure drop varies from 2 MPa to 4 MPa. Consequently,\nadvance water injection is necessary to keep the formation pressure and oil production during oilfield\ndevelopment of unconsolidated sandstone reservoir. Simultaneously, the study can provide theoretical\nbasis and references for the similar reservoirs.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "YU XIONG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hongguang Xu, Yongqing Wang, Wensheng Zhou, Chen Liu, Ling Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Compaction, Sand production, Seepage, Unconsolidated sandstone", "Sumber": "Petroleum 4 (2018) 358-363 - KeAi, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.05.003", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Jan 2019"}
