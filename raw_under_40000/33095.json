{"Nomor": 33095, "Judul": "The home math environment: More than numeracy", "Abstrak": "The goal of the current study is to develop a more complete understanding of the early home math\nenvironment, encompassing both numeracy and non-numeracy aspects of that environment. Parents\nof preschoolers (n = 63) were surveyed about their support of three components of early mathematics\nknowledge (i.e., numeracy, spatial, and pattern) as well as parents\u2019 math-related beliefs aboutthemselves\nand their children. Children were administered a broad math knowledge assessment which included a\nnumeracy subscale, and individual measures of spatial and patterning skills in the fall (concurrently).\nBroad math knowledge was measured again in the spring of the preschool year. Parents indicated providing some support of early math development through numeracy, spatial, and patterning activities,\nwith a stronger emphasis on numeracy than pattern and space. Parents\u2019 child-specific ability beliefs\nwere related to their numeracy, pattern, and broad math support, while their parent-specific ability\nbeliefs were related to their spatial support. Parent support was rarely linked to child skills, except that\nnumeracy support related to concurrent numeracy knowledge. Findings suggest that although parents\ndo support a broad range of early math skills at home, parents tend to prioritize supporting early numeracy. Parents\u2019 beliefs, especially about their child\u2019s academic abilities, may influence components of the\nearly home math environment, but future research is needed to better understand the relations between\nparent\u2019s academic beliefs and the home math environment they create.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Erica L Zippert [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": [", Bethany Rittle-Johnson"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Broad mathematics knowledge Preschool Parents Numeracy knowledge Patterning skills Spatial skills Home math environment", "Sumber": "Early Childhood Research Quarterly xxx (2018) xxx\u2013xxx", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Jan 2019"}
