{"Nomor": 33069, "Judul": "Analytical solution of the pseudo-3D model for hydraulic fracturing in a storage-dominated regime", "Abstrak": "This paper deals with the so-called \u201cpseudo-three-dimensional\u201d (P3D) model of a hydraulic fracture with\nequilibrium height growth across two symmetric stress barriers. The key simplifying assumptions behind the\nP3D model are as follows: the fracture profile perpendicular to the main propagation direction is in a condition\nof plane strain; the equilibrium height and form are fully determined by the fluid pressure, rock stress contrast,\nand toughness; and in the equilibrium height growth P3D models, the pressure is uniform in each vertical crosssection.\nThis particular model is assessed by first formulating the non-linear differential equations in the specific\ndimensionless form and finding an analytical solution in a storage-dominated regime. Whole differential\nequations were rewritten to correspond to the evolution of the length and time from the fracture height in the\ncenter. That specific form leads to an analytical solution with small dimensionless parameters.\nAn analysis of the analytical solution obtained enables the derivation of a fracture's length, aperture, and form\nfrom the height in the center. The solution obtained was compared to a numerical one that was previously\nknown.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Egor V. Shel [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Grigory V.
