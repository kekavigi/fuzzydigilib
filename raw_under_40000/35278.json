Often\nthey fail to properly define terms or reflect deeply within theological categories.

It is part of an attempt to uncover and confront our own cultural blind spotsand biases, and in turn value the other more highly than ourselves", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jon Putt [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "culture, ethnicity, theology", "Sumber": "Foundations 74 (May 2018): 28 - 44", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Feb 2019"}
