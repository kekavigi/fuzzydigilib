{"Nomor": 34688, "Judul": "Study On Sulfur Deposition Damage Model Of Fractured Gas Reservoirs With High-Content H2S", "Abstrak": "Due to extreme poison, strong corrosion, and complex precipitation and deposition of H2S in the\nreservoir, it is very difficult and risky to investigate and explore drilling, completion, production\nand gas transportation. In the course of production of fractured gas reservoir with high H2S content,\nformation pressure falls continually, which lead to decline of solubility of sulfur particles in gas\nphase. Sulfur particles which dissolve in gas phase originally in the formation should precipitate\nfrom gas phase after running up to saturation state and deposit at pore space and throat,\nsequentially resulting in formation porosity and permeability reduction. At present, the researches\nof sulfur deposition are mainly focused on the conventional gas reservoirs and sulfur deposition in\nthe near wellbore region is generally estimated using Roberts' model. However, most of the gas\nreservoirs with high-content H2S are fractured gas reservoirs, classical damage model is no longer\napplicable to fractured gas reservoirs with high H2S content. In the present study, a sulfur deposition damage model is established. The refined model, based on non-Darcy flow, takes into\nconsideration the effects of sulfur deposition, variation in gas properties and fracture. In addition,\nthe effect of gas well production rate on formation permeability is also studied. The results show\nthat formation permeability decreases with fracture aperture and gas well production rate\nincreasing. The bigger gas well production rate is, the quicker sulfur precipitates. The sulfur\ndeposition of fractured gas reservoir with high-content H2S is mainly in the near wellbore zone,\nand the fracture aperture has a significant impact on the formation permeability in the near\nwellbore zone.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Linji He [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Linji He", "Xiao Guo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "High-content H2S, Fracture, Sulfur deposition, Permeability, Damage model", "Sumber": "Petroleum, Volume 3, Issue 3, 321-325 (September 2017)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Feb 2019"}
