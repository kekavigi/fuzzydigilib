{"Nomor": 37583, "Judul": "Percolation in Fock space as a proxy for many-body localization", "Abstrak": "We study classical percolation models in Fock space as proxies for the quantum many-body localization\n(MBL) transition. Percolation rules are defined for two models of disordered quantum spin chains using their microscopic quantum Hamiltonians and the topologies of the associated Fock-space graphs. The percolation transition is revealed by the statistics of Fock-space cluster sizes, obtained by exact enumeration for finite-sized systems. As a function of disorder strength, the typical cluster size shows a transition from a volume law in Fock space to subvolume law, directly analogous to the behavior of eigenstate participation entropies across the MBL transition. Finite-size scaling analyses for several diagnostics of cluster size statistics yield mutually consistent critical properties.We show further that local observables averaged over Fock-space clusters also carry signatures of the transition, with their behavior across it in direct analogy to that of corresponding eigenstate expectation values across the MBL transition. The Fock-space clusters can be explored under a mapping to kinetically constrained models. Dynamics within this framework likewise show the ergodicity-breaking transition via Monte Carlo averaged local observables and yield critical properties consistent with those obtained from both exact\ncluster enumeration and analytic results derived in our recent work [arXiv:1812.05115]. This mapping allows access to system sizes two orders of magnitude larger than those accessible in exact enumerations. Simple physical pictures based on freezing of local real-space segments of spins are also presented and shown to give values for the critical disorder strength and correlation length exponent ? consistent with numerical studies.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Sthitadhi Roy [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["J.
