{"Nomor": 32491, "Judul": "Knowledge of nonlocal mathematics for teaching", "Abstrak": "The notion of practice-based models for mathematical knowledge for teaching has played a pivotal\nrole in the conception of teacher knowledge. In this work, teachers\u2019 knowledge of mathematics\nthat is outside the scope of what is being taught (nonlocal mathematics) is considered\nmore explicitly. Drawing on a cognitive model for the development of mathematical knowledge\nfor teaching, this paper explores the implications for the underlying theory being applied to\n(nonlocal) knowledge outside the scope what is being taught as being influential for the teaching\nof (local) mathematics. The work provides a unique perspective on the role of advanced\nmathematics with respect to secondary teaching. Considerations for mathematics teacher education\nare discussed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Nicholas H.
