In order to analyze the behavior of the spheres under different rheological\nconditions, we varied the concentration of the polymer and glycerin. To examine the\ninfluence of wall effects, the experiments were performed in two containers of different\nsize. We found that depending on the fluids\u2019 rheological properties, two different regimes\nare revealed for the same diluted polymer. In one of them (I), the separation between the\nspheres grows in time if the initial separation Si is beyond a critical distance Sc, while the\nseparation decreases for an initial distance shorter than Sc. In the second observed regime\n(II), the spheres aggregate if Si < Sc while they remain unchanged in their separation if\nSi > Sc, i.e., repulsion is not detected. The transition from one to another regime can be\nproduced at constant polymer concentration by changing the solvent viscosity ?s. In our\nexperiments this shift has been done modifying the glycerin-water proportion. Although\nthese two behaviors were reported in previous works for different viscoelastic fluids, a\nresult that we show is that both regimes can be observed for the same polymer. The elusive\nregime I, in which far-field repulsion is exhibited, is of particular interest since it has been\npreviously reported only by Riddle et al. [J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 2, 23 (1997)].\nThus, our results confirm that this behavior is also feasible.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "D. FREIRE [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["L. G.
