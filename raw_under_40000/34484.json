{"Nomor": 34484, "Judul": "An information systems design product theory for the class of integrated requirements and release management systems", "Abstrak": "High-tech companies conducting product development need to collect and analyze requirements effectively,plan and implement releases, and allocate requirements to appropriate releases. Requirements and releasemanagement are complicated because development activities typically are scattered across multiple sites,involve multiple partners in different countries, leverage various development methods and tools, and are realized through various organizational arrangements such as release projects in organizations structured around products and permanent release teams in organizations responsible for the long-term development and maintenance of strategic software and hardware assets. Flexible, scalable, and secure groupware based support for the activities provides substantial payoffs. Yet, the extant literature provides little theoretical guidance for designing and using requirements and release management systems (RRMS) inmulti-site, multi-partner environments. This article develops the meta-requirements and a meta-design of an Information Systems Design Product Theory for the class of RRMS based on a case study in a global\ncompany and a literature review. The theory is scalable to meet the needs of global companies but simple enough so that small and medium-sized companies can also leverage it to implement requirements and release management solutions.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "TIMO KAKOLA  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mervi Koivulahti-Ojala  and Jani Liimatainen"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "lobal software product development; information systems design theory; knowledge management;  release  management;  requirements  management;  software  process improvement", "Sumber": "JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE AND EVOLUTION: RESEARCH AND PRACTICE", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Feb 2019"}
