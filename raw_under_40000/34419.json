Due to \nthe  interactivity,  immersion  and  real  time  of  virtual  reality  technology,  the  application  of  VR \nhas a wide prospect in the field of architecture, especially in the interior decoration and design, \nthe  advantage  of  this  technology  is  incomparable  with  other  technologies.  The  interior \ndesign using virtual reality can let the designer and the user experience the effect of what you see. In \naddition,  it  also  allows  users  to  feel  like  being  inside  the  designed  virtual  scene of this  design and  feeling  immersive.  In  this  paper,  the  3D interior  design  and  simulation system  is  taken  as \nthe research object, and the  virtual reality technology is applied to the design and application \nof the simulation system.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zhimin Gao  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jiaxi Huang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Virtual reality; Interior design; 3D modeling; Simulation system", "Sumber": "ACADEMIC JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING ENGINEERING, VOL.  16 , ISSUE  3 /2018", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Feb 2019"}
