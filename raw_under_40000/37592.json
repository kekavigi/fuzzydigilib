{"Nomor": 37592, "Judul": "Half-Pipe Palladium Nanotube-Based Hydrogen Sensor Using aSuspended Nanofiber Scaffold", "Abstrak": "A half-pipe palladium nanotube network (H-PdNTN) structure was developedfor high-performance hydrogen (H2) sensor applications. To fabricate the sensor, suspendedpoly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) nanofiber bundles were electrospun on a conductive substrate,followed by a palladium (Pd) deposition on top of the PVA nanofiber bundles. Then, Pd-deposited PVA nanofibers were transferred to a host substrate, and the PVA nanofibertemplates were selectively removed. Various material analyses confirmed that the PVAnanofibers were successfully dissolved leaving a half-pipe-shaped Pd nanotube network. Thefabricated Pd nanotube-based sensors were tested for H2responses with different gasconcentrations. The 4 nm thick sensor showed the highest response (?R/R0)toH2gas.Platinum (Pt) decoration of the sensor showed an improved response speed compared to thatof the pristine sensor via the catalytic function of Pt. Additionally, the sensor exhibited good H2selectivity against other interfering gases. The H-PdNTN H2sensor provides a facile and cost-effective way to fabricate high-performance H2sensors.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Minkyu_Cho_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/165035"}, "Penulis": "Minkyu Cho [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jianxiong Zhu, Hyeonggyun Kim, Kyungnam Kang, and Inkyu Park"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "electrospinning, electrospun nanofiber, metal nanostructure, palladium nanotube, hydrogen sensor", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
