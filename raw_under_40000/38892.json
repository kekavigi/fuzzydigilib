{"Nomor": 38892, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT OF 3-DIMENSIONAL BOUNDARY ELEMENT CODE FOR ELASTODYNAMIC ANALYSIS", "Abstrak": "The increasing accuracy requirements in many of todays simulation tasks in science and\nengineering more and more often entail the need to take into account more than one physical\neect. Among the most important and most challenging of such multiphysics problems,\nwith respect to both modelling and computational issues, are \nuid-structure interactions\n(FSI), i.e. interactions of some movable or deformable elastic structure with an internal or\nsurrounding \nuid \now. Fluid-structure interaction problems and multiphysics problems in\ngeneral are often too complex to solve analytically and so they have to be analyzed by means\nof experiments or numerical simulation. Two main approaches exist for the simulation of\n\nuid-structure interaction problems; Monolithic and Partitioned approaches. In Monolithic\napproach, the equations governing the \now and the displacement of the structure are solved\nsimultaneously, with a single solver. While in Partitioned approach, the equations governing\nthe \now and the displacement of the structure are solved separately, with two distinct\nsolvers. In this work a structural analysis code to simulate the response of linear elastic\nstructure in FSI was developed. Boundary Element Method (BEM), a numerical technique\nbased on the boundary integral equations of continuum mechanics problems, was adopted\nto solve the corresponding equation of motion. To obtain the dynamic solutions in BEM,\nthe so-called Dual Reciprocity Method (DRM) was incorporated", "Daftar File": {"COVER Nyoman Dwi Prayuda Pande": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170549", "BAB 1 Nyoman Dwi Prayuda Pande": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170550", "BAB 2 Nyoman Dwi Prayuda Pande": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170551", "BAB 3 Nyoman Dwi Prayuda Pande": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170552", "BAB 4 Nyoman Dwi Prayuda Pande": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170553", "BAB 5 Nyoman Dwi Prayuda Pande": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170554", "PUSTAKA Nyoman Dwi Prayuda Pande": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170555"}, "Penulis": "Nyoman Dwi Prayuda Pande [23608301]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Lavi Rizki Zuhal", "Prof. Dr. Ir.
