{"Nomor": 34522, "Judul": "Utilizing the geological data and remote sensing applications for investigation of groundwater occurrences, West El Minia, Western Desert of Egypt", "Abstrak": "West EL Minia area is considered one of promising areas for future development plans in Egypt. The current\nresearch provides an integrated remote sensing data, microfacies analysis, field studies and geochemical approach\nto investigate the groundwater resources in West El Minia area. Three aquifers were investigated;\nOligocene sandstone, Middle Eocene limestone and Nubian sandstone aquifer. New data about two aquifers\n(Nubian sandstone and Oligocene) are presented in the current study extracted from well logging interpretation\nand wells rock samples. The groundwater of the Oligocene sandstone and Middle Eocene limestone aquifers are\nrecorded under unconfined conditions, while the Nubian sandstone is recorded as confined aquifer. The total\nthicknesses of the three aquifers were identified through interpretation of the well logging data (180m for\nOligocene aquifer, 445m for the Middle Eocene aquifer, and 145m for Nubian sandstone aquifer). The present\nstudy discusses the groundwater levels, the geological controls and groundwater chemistry of the recorded\naquifers. The low salinity values (560\u2013916 mg/l) and water table map as well as the obtained stable isotopes data\nreveal that the Middle Eocene aquifer is recharged from the Nile River where it has isotopic signature of the\nmodern Nile water with slightly contribution of paleo-water of the Nubian sandstone. The area is affected by sets\nof faults associated with fractures and joints and facilitates the groundwater recharge. Based on multi GIS data\nlayers, remote sensing data, geologic investigation as well as geophysical data, a future groundwater strategy\nwere presented.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mohamed Yousif [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hassan S.
