{"Nomor": 37573, "Judul": "NONLINEAR VIBRATIONOF THE COUPLED STRUCTURE OF SUSPENDED-CABLE-STAYED BEAM\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd1:2 INTERNAL RESONANCE", "Abstrak": "Through the Galerkin method the nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs)\nin time are obtained from the nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) to describe the mo-\ntion of the coupled structure of a suspended-cable-stayed beam. In the PDEs, the curvature of\nmain cables and the deformation of cable stays are taken into account. The dynamics of the struc-\nture is investigated based on the ODEs when the structure is subjected to a harmonic excitation\nin the presence of both high-frequency principle resonance and 1:2 internal resonance. It is found\nthat there are typical jumps and saturation phenomena of the vibration amplitude in the struc-\nture. And the structure may present quasi-periodic vibration or chaos, if the stiffness of the cable\nstays membrane and frequency of external excitation are disturbed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Kun  Huang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Qi Feng, Ya jun  Y in"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "the coupled structure of suspended-cable-stayed beam, the multiscale method, 1:2 internal resonance, Hopf bifurcation, chaos", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Apr 2019"}
