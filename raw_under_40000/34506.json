{"Nomor": 34506, "Judul": "Research on PLM-oriented Product Design Evaluation  Based on User  Experience", "Abstrak": "With  the  rapid  development  of  experience  economy,  manufacturing  should provide \nproducts and services which can satisfy the users.  The product design evaluation methods and the \nrelationships  with  PLM  were  studied.  The  research  actuality  and deficiency  of  product  user \nexperience  were  analyzed.  To  solve  the  problems  which  product  design  evaluation  cannot  be \nimplemented  throughout  the  whole  product  life  cycle  and  user  experience  cannot  guide  design \nevaluation, product development process was divided into four stages based on the product lifecycle \nmanagement. The design evaluation requirements for every stage were researched, the evaluation \ncontents were analyzed with user experience methods, and the evaluation targets and missions were \nsummarized.  So  the  model  of  PLM-oriented  product  design  evaluation  system  based  on  user \nexperience was established. It proposed the direction of future research, and wished to guide the \ndevelopment of PLM-oriented product design.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Li Xiaona  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Liu Hengli"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "PLM; Product Design Evaluation; User Experience", "Sumber": "Key Engineering Materials. 2016, Vol. 693, p1905-1909. 5p", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos \u00a0\n                                     Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Feb 2019"}
