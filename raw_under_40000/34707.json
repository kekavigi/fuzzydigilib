{"Nomor": 34707, "Judul": "Pressure Transient Analysis Of Multiple Fractured Horizontal Wells In Naturally Fractured Unconventional Reservoirs Based On Fractal Theory And Fractional Calculus", "Abstrak": "Currently, most models for multiple fractured horizontal wells (MFHWs) in naturally fractured\nunconventional reservoirs (NFURs) are based on classical Euclidean models which implicitly assume a uniform distribution of natural fractures and that all fractures are homogeneous. While\nfractal theory provides a powerful method to describe the disorder, heterogeneity, uncertainty and\ncomplexity of the NFURs. In this paper, a fractally fractional diffusion model (FFDM) for MFHWs in\nNFURs is established based on fractal theory and fractional calculus. Particularly, fractal theory is\nused to describe the heterogeneous, complex fracture network, with consideration of anomalous\nbehavior of diffusion process in NFURs by employing fractional calculus. The Laplace transformation, line source function, dispersion method, and superposition principle are used to solve\nthis new model. The pressure responses in the real time domain are obtained with Stehfest numerical inversion algorithms. The type curves of MFHW with three different outer boundaries are\nplotted. Sensitivity analysis of some related parameters are discussed as well. This new model\nprovides the relatively more accurate and appropriate evaluation results for pressure transient\nanalysis for MFHWs in NFURs, which could be applied to accurately interpret the real pressure data\nof an MFHW in field.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Daihong Gu  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Daoquan Ding", "Zeli Gao b , Aihua Zhang", "Leng Tian", "Tianpeng Wu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Fractal theory, Anomalous diffusion, Fractional calculus, Naturally fractured unconventional reservoirs, Multiple fractured horizontal well, Pressure responses", "Sumber": "Petroleum, Volume 3, Issue 3, 326-339 (September 2017)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Feb 2019"}
