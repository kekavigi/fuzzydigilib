{"Nomor": 35049, "Judul": "Feasibility of industrial-scale treatment of dye wastewater via bioadsorption technology", "Abstrak": "This review emphasizes the importance of costs in industrial-scale treatment of dye wastewater and provides a\nway to assess the cost-based feasibility of bio-adsorption technologies. Dye wastewater is one of the major\ncontributors to environmental pollution. Bio-adsorption has attracted considerable attentions in dye wastewater\ntreatment due to its technical feasibility, flexibility and operation simplicity. However, industrial-scale treatment\nof dye wastewater via bio-adsorption technologies remains stagnant, mainly due to high costs. So far, no review\nor research articles have systematically discussed the criteria for successful utilization of bio-adsorption technologies on a large scale. This review discusses the major factors affecting adsorption and desorption performance based on basic chemical and physical structures of bio-adsorbents available in literatures. A quantitative\nrelationship has been summarized based on previous studies to assess the cost to utilize a bio-adsorption\ntechnology and serve as an access threshold for quality bio-adsorbents to be taken into real applications.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Wei Li [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Bingnan Mu.,Yiqi Yang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Dye wastewater Dye removal Bio-adsorption technology Cost assessment Industrial-scale wastewater treatment", "Sumber": "Bioresource Technology 277 (2019) 157\u2013170", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Feb 2019"}
