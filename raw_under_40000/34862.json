A two-phase flow model for Bingham fluids flow in a single saturated fracture is extended to\nsimulate cement grouts propagation in saturated networks. Using this extended model, the impacts of network\nstructure and hydraulic variability, i.e., network geometry and aperture distribution, on the propagation process\nare investigated through numerical simulations. Cement grout propagation in 50 realizations of a two-dimensional discrete fracture network (2D DFN) are simulated with different cases of aperture variability, i.e. constant\naperture, uncorrelated and length-correlated heterogeneous apertures following a truncated lognormal distribution. The results indicate that network structure and hydraulic variability significantly affect the grout\npropagation in 2D DFN systems. The randomized network structure and uncorrelated heterogeneous apertures\nsignificantly delay the propagation rate and largely increase the variability range of the propagation volume\nfraction. In contrast, in the case with length-correlated heterogeneous apertures, the propagation rate increases,\nwhile the variability range and rate of change of the propagation volume fraction decreases. The extended twophase flow model for fracture networks and the simulation results presented in this work are useful for basic\nunderstanding of the processes relevant for design, monitoring and execution of rock grouting", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Liangchao Zou [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ulf H\u00e5kansson and Vladimir Cvetkovic"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Rock grouting, Bingham fluids, Two-phase flow, Discrete fracture networks, Propagation volume fraction, Uncertainty quantification", "Sumber": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrmms.2019.01.004", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Feb 2019"}
