{"Nomor": 32442, "Judul": "Validation of the 2018 FIGO cervical cancer staging system", "Abstrak": "Objective. To validate the revised 2018 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system for cervical cancer, with a particular focus on stage IB and stage III disease.\nMethods. Two retrospective cohort studies were conducted using The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End\nResults Program between 1988 and 2014. The stage IB cohort consisted of node-negative FIGO stage IB1\n(tumor size b2 cm), IB2 (2\u20133.9 cm), and IB3 (?4 cm) cervical cancer. The stage III cohort consisted of FIGO stage IIIA, IIIB, and stage IIIC1 (any pelvic nodal metastasis) cervical cancer.Multivariable analysis was performed for cause-specific survival based on cancer stage.\nResults. In the stage IB cohort (n=8909), stage IB1 tumors were more likely to be adenocarcinoma and lowgrade compared to other the groups (P b 0.001). On multivariable analysis, stage IB2 disease was independently associated with a nearly two-fold increased risk of cervical cancer mortality compared to stage IB1 disease (adjusted-hazard ratio [HR] 1.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.62\u20132.41, P b 0.001). In the stage III cohort (n =11,733), stage IIIC1 was independently associated with improved cause-specific survival compared to stageIIIB disease (adjusted-HR 0.79, 95%CI 0.74\u20130.85, P b 0.001). Survival of stage IIIC1 disease significantly differedbased on T=stage, (5-year rates: 74.8% for T1, 58.7% for T2, and 39.3% for T3)with a 35.3% difference in absolutesurvival (P b 0.001).\nConclusion. The 2018 FIGO staging systemfor cervical cancer is useful to distinguish survival groups; stage IB1and stage IB2 disease have distinct characteristics and survival outcomes, while survival in stage IIIC1 varies dependingon local tumor factors.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Koji Matsuo  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hiroko Machida d, Rachel S.
