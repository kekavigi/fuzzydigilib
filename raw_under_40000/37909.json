{"Nomor": 37909, "Judul": "Surface Pair-Density-Wave Superconducting and Superfluid States", "Abstrak": "Fulde, Ferrell, Larkin, and Ovchinnikov (FFLO) predicted inhomogeneous superconducting andsuperfluid ground states, spontaneously breaking translation symmetries. In this Letter, we demonstratethat the transition from the FFLO to the normal state as a function of temperature or increased Fermi surfacesplitting is not a direct one. Instead, the system has an additional phase transition to a different state wherepair-density-wave superconductivity (or superfluidity) exists only on the boundaries of the system, whilethe bulk of the system is normal. The surface pair-density-wave state is very robust and exists for muchlarger fields and temperatures than the FFLO state.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mats Barkman [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Albert Samoilenka,", "and Egor Babaev"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS122,165302 (2019); \u00a9 2019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Apr 2019"}
