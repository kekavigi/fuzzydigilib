The main objective of the survey was to highlight the applicability, efficiency, and reliability of\nutilizing such non-invasive surface techniques in a field like geologic mapping, and hence to image both the\nvertical and lateral electrical resistivity structures of the subsurface bedrock. Consequently, a total of reliable\n6 multi-spacing electromagnetic\u2013terrain conductivity meter and 7 DC\u2013resistivity horizontal profiles\nwere carried out between August 2016 and February 2017. All data sets were transformed\u2013inverted extensively\nand consistently in terms of two-dimensional (2D) electrical resistivity smoothed-earth models.\nThey could be used effectively and inexpensively to interpret the area's bedrock geologic sequence using the\nencountered consecutive electrically resistive and conductive anomalies. Notably, the encountered subsurface\nelectrical resistivity structures, below all surveying profiles, are correlated well with the mapped\ngeological faults in the field. They even could provide a useful understanding of their faulting fashion.\nAbsolute resistivity values were not necessarily diagnostic, but their vertical and lateral variations could\nprovide more diagnostic information about the layer lateral extensions and thicknesses, and hence suggested\nreliable geo-electric earth models. The study demonstrated that a detailed multi-spacing electromagnetic\u2013\nterrain conductivity meter and DC\u2013resistivity horizontal profiling survey can help design an optimal\ngeotechnical investigative program, not only for the whole eastern extensional area of the 15th-of-May\nCity, but also for the other new urban communities within the Egyptian desert.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Said A.
