{"Nomor": 38514, "Judul": "The Contribution of Social Media to Body Dissatisfaction, Eating Disorder Symptoms, and Anabolic Steroid Use Among Sexual Minority Men", "Abstrak": "Social media has been associated with body dissatisfaction and eating disorder symptoms among young women and adolescent girls. However, despite notable evidence of susceptibility to body image pressures, it remains unknown whether these associations generalize to sexual minority men. A nationwide sample of 2,733 sexual minority men completed an online survey advertised to Australian and New Zealand users of a popular dating app.  Participants  answered  questions  about  how  frequently  they  used  11  different  social  media  platforms  in addition to questions about their dating app use, body image, eating disorder symptoms, and anabolic steroids.Facebook, Youtube, Instagram, and Snapchat were the most frequently used social media platforms. A pattern\nof  small-sized  and  positive  associations  emerged  between  social  media  use  and  body dissatisfaction,  eating disorder symptoms, and thoughts about using anabolic steroids. Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat evidenced the strongest associations. The associations of social media use with both muscularity dissatisfaction and eating disorder symptoms were  stronger for image-centric  social media platforms (e.g., Instagram) than  nonimage-centric  platforms (e.g.,  Wordpress);  no  differences  were  observed for  body fat  dissatisfaction,  height  dissatisfaction, or thoughts about using anabolic steroids. Previously documented associations of social media use with body dissatisfaction and related variables among women and girls appear to generalize to sexual minority men. Social media platforms that more centrally involve imagery may be of greater concern than nonimage-centric platforms. Additional research with sexual minority men is needed to elucidate the distinctions between adaptive and maladaptive social media use in the context of body dissatisfaction, eating disorders, and anabolic steroid use.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Scott Griffiths [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Stuart B.
