{"Nomor": 32950, "Judul": "Design And Realization Of Rock Salt Gas Storage Database Management System Based On SQL Server", "Abstrak": "Projects involving the construction of rock salt underground gas storage have several disadvantages, for\nexample, effective management is not employed to manage the production information and data in the\nprocess of the project, resulting in duplication of data storage, waste of storage space, lower efficiency of\ndata calling, and negative effects on the efficiency of data update. Therefore, a database and its management systems for a rock salt gas storage was constructed based on an SQL Server database system,\nprimarily including the management forms of the geological modeling, storage simulation, stability\nevaluation, economic evaluation, and covering the addition and delete checks of static and dynamic data.\nThe security of the system was improved by setting the administrator permission. The establishment of\nthe database management system was of tremendous importance and it provided a significant technical\nsupport for the development of the gas storage project", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "YINGJIE WANG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jianjun Li, Xiang He, Bing Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Computer technology and application, Database system, SQL Serve,r, Rock salt gas storage", "Sumber": "Petroleum 4 (2018) 466-472 - KeAi, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2017.10.001", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Jan 2019"}
