{"Nomor": 37703, "Judul": "Unlinkable minutiae-based fuzzy vault for multiple fingerprints", "Abstrak": "The \u2018fuzzy vault scheme\u2019 is a cryptographic primitive being considered for storing fingerprint minutiae protected. A well-known problem of the fuzzy vault scheme is its vulnerability against correlation attack-based cross-matching thereby conflicting with the \u2018unlinkability requirement\u2019 and \u2018irreversibility requirement\u2019 of effective biometric information protection. Yet, it has been demonstrated that in principle a minutiae-based fuzzy vault can be secured against the correlation attack by passing the to-be-protected minutiae through a quantisation scheme. Unfortunately, single fingerprints seem not to be capable of providing an acceptable security level against offline attacks. To overcome the aforementioned security issues, this study shows how an implementation for multiple fingerprints can be derived on basis of the implementation for single finger thereby making use of a Guruswami\u2013Sudan algorithmbased decoder for verification. The implementation, for which public C++ source code can be downloaded, is evaluated for single and various multi-finger settings using the MCYT-Fingerprint-100 database and provides security-enhancing features such as the possibility of combination with password and a slow-down mechanism.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Benjamin Tams [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Mobile Biometrics,  multiple fingerprints", "Sumber": "IET Biometrics", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Apr 2019"}
