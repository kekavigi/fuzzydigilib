Several widely\nconsumed compounds have been detected in wastewater samples from different origins and geographical\nareas in Colombia. The studied pharmaceuticals included antibiotics, analgesics and anti-inflammatories, cholesterol lowering statin drugs, lipid regulators, and anti-depressants. The investigated samples were urban wastewater collected during one whole week before (influent) and after treatment (effluent) in the wastewater\ntreatment plants (WWTPs) of Bogot\u00e1 and Medellin. Raw wastewater from the Hospital of Tumaco and from\nthe city of Florencia were also collected. Analyses performed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed that most of the target analytes were present in all the wastewater samples. The\nhighest concentrations (up to 50 ?g/L) corresponded to acetaminophen, but several antibiotics, such as\nazithromycin, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, and antihypertensive drugs, such as losartan and valsartan, were\ncommonly present in influent wastewater (IWW) at levels above 1 ?g/L. Moreover, the treatment applied in\nWWTPs seemed to not efficiently remove the compounds under study, because most pharmaceuticals were\nalso present in effluent wastewater (EWW) at concentrations close to those of the IWW. Special emphasis was\nmade in this work on the quality of data reported, performing a detailed study of quality control (QC) samples.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "A.M.
