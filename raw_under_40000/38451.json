{"Nomor": 38451, "Judul": "Sustainable Changes in the Contents of Metallic Micronutrients in First Generation Gram Seeds Imposed by Carbon Nano-onions: Life Cycle Seed to Seed Study", "Abstrak": "Plant?nanocarbon interactions have been mostly explored\nfor enhanced germination, cell growth, and plant growth, with a limited\nstudy on the productivity of seeds under controlled conditions. The present\nfinding reports the sustainable impacts of biowaste (wood wool) derived\nnanocarbons as carbon nano-onions (CNOs) on the entire life cycle of gram\nplants to obtain the first generation seeds (FGSs) as \u201cseed to seed\u201d. A watersoluble version of CNOs as water-soluble carbon nano-onions (wsCNOs) at\n0 (control), 10, 20, and 30 ?g mL?1 were used for the germination of gram\nseeds, for the initial 10 days only. Followed by transferring of 10 days old\nbaby plants into the soil to complete their natural life cycle (?4 months).\nFGSs harvested from the wsCNOs treated plants showed a significant\nincrease in their yield and health with respect to their individual weight,\noverall dimensions, enhanced protein, stored electrolytes and metallic\nmicronutrient contents. The protein content increased from 96 to 170 ?g\nmL?1\n, and the level of electrolytic conductivity increased from 2.2 to 3.4 mS in the FGSs, harvested from the plants treated with 0\n(control) to 30 ?g mL?1 of wsCNOs, respectively. wsCNOs used here were presumably acting as a stimulant to increase the\ncontents of metallic micronutrients (Mn, Mo, Cu, Zn, Fe, and Ni) in FGSs without showing its inside accumulations as a\ncontaminant examined by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and Raman spectral analysis. In the future, a sustainable\napproach for the utilization of wood waste as a nanofertilizer could provide a possible approach in agricultural science to\novercome the shortage of stored nutrients inside the seeds and also to limit the excessive use of fertilizers.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Kumud Malika Tripathi 1.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/169732"}, "Penulis": "Kumud Malika Tripathi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Anshu Bhati, Anupriya Singh, Amit Kumar Sonker, Sabyasachi Sarkar, Sumit Kumar Sonkar"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "Waste wood wool, Water-soluble carbon nano-onions, First generation seeds, Micronutrients, Protein content, Conductivity, Enhanced productivity, Nanofertilizer", "Sumber": "pubs.acs.org/journal/ascecg", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Mei 2019"}
