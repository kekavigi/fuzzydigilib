{"Nomor": 35955, "Judul": "In-situ microscale visualization experiments on microcracking and microdeformation behaviour around a pre-crack tip in a three-point bending sandstone", "Abstrak": "A new microscale visualization experimental system is proposed for in-situ measurement of microcracking and\nmicrodeformation behaviour of macroscopic specimens during real-time loading. A series of three-point bending\nexperiments were conducted on sandstone beam specimens containing a Mode I pre-crack. The newly developed\nmicroscopic experimental system and two other traditional experimental techniques, including acoustic emission\n(AE) monitoring and macroscopic charge coupled device (CCD) monitoring, were applied together to capture\nand measure the cracking process and deformation characteristics around the pre-crack tip in real-time. The\nresults show that the crack initiation determined by the proposed microscopic monitoring system was earlier\nthan that determined by AE monitoring and macroscopic CCD monitoring. The microscopic monitoring system\nobserved that the cracks initiated at multiple locations at the pre-crack tip, and they continuously propagated,\nopened, and coalesced with each other to eventually form a main crack in a zigzag and irregular way, which is\nsignificantly different from the macroscopic CCD monitoring observations that suggested that the crack only\ninitiated from the pre-crack tip and rapidly extended upwards along the pre-crack length direction in a relatively\nsimple way. Furthermore, the full-field deformation characteristics at the pre-crack tip were quantitatively\nobtained by the macrograph-based digital image correlation (DIC) and the micrograph-based DIC calculations.\nThe results indicate that the calculated localized strain zones from the micrograph-based DIC were narrower\nthan those calculated from the macrograph-based DIC. The former had a very similar morphology to realistic\nmicroscopic cracks, whereas the latter was wider and longer than the induced macroscopic cracks. The average\ncritical crack opening displacement (COD) calculated using the micrograph-based DIC was approximately 1.3\ntimes larger than that calculated using the macrograph-based DIC.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yinlong Lu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wenshuai Li, Lianguo Wang, Xingyu Meng, Bin Wang, Kaiwen Zhang, Xiaodong Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Three-point bending experiments, Microcracking, Microdeformation, In-situ monitoring, Visualization, DIC", "Sumber": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrmms.2019.01.002", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "05 Mar 2019"}
