{"Nomor": 32427, "Judul": "Comparison of the specific energy demand of aeroplanes and other vehicle systems", "Abstrak": "A  method  will  be  described  which  allows  for  a  uniform  approach  to  determine  the  specific  energy demand of aeroplanes and other vehicle systems. By the introduction of a dimensionless figure, it can be used for comparison irrespective of the very dissimilar definitions. The entity e;\nwell known from the physic of flight, the g lide number F i.e. the inverse of the L = D-ratio in Anglo American literature F proves to be a convenient starting point.\nIn order to utilise the primary energy demand as a basis for comparison, further factors have to be taken into consideration and expressed as efficiency levels, as is usual in energy sciences. By doing this, a deep insight will be gained into the different physical and technical elements of transportation processes. Some unexpected results are derived. In particular, the role of the aeroplane has to be adjusted substantially with respect to public opinion.\n\n2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "H.A.
