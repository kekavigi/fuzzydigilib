{"Nomor": 35931, "Judul": "Translation algorithm of the apparent conductivity using the frequency-domain electromagnetic method of a magnetic dipole", "Abstrak": "In this paper, based on the expression of the relativemagnetic anomaly for a frequency-domain magnetic dipole\nin homogeneous half-space under quasi-static conditions, we derive higher-order approximate formulas of the\napparent conductivity. At the same time, it is found that there is a translational and expansionary characteristic\nbetween the response curve of the relative magnetic anomaly for the frequency-domain magnetic dipole and\nunderground conductivity and observation frequency. Accordingly, we propose a translation algorithm that\ncan directly calculate the apparent conductivity. By processing the data of the theoretical models and the\nGEM-2 electromagnetic measurement data from the detection of the thickness of Arctic sea ice, we validate\nthe effectiveness of this method. In comparison with the conventional and the higher-order approximate\ncalculation formula of the apparent conductivity, this method features fast computation speed, high accuracy,\nand insensitivity to the instrument height. Meanwhile, it also helps explain the burial depth of the conductive\nlayer. Therefore, it is worth popularizing and applying in practical applications.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xiaoping He [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Huajun Wang, Sidi Ma"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Magnetic dipole Frequency-domain electromagnetic method Apparent conductivity GEM-2 Thickness of sea ice Translation algorithm", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 146 (2017) 221\u2013227, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.09.015", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "05 Mar 2019"}
