{"Nomor": 33128, "Judul": "Topic modelling of ecology, environment and poverty nexus: An integrated framework", "Abstrak": "There is little research on the ecology, environment and poverty nexus. To understand the major research\nconcerns and clusters of ecology, environment and poverty (EEP), we have built an integrated framework of their\nnexus to pursue sustainable development. We have collected 4335 English language publications using the\nsearch terms \u201cEcology and Environment and poverty\u201d by type \u201cTopic\u201d in Web of Science, covering publication\nyears from 1981 to 2017. A 9-topic model, 35 references with the strongest citation bursts and the top-30\ncitation clusters are used to describe the integrated framework. We introduce topic modelling into the EEP field\nusing scientific articles, combined with bibliometric analysis and visualisation approaches, and finally propose\nan integrated ecology-environment-poverty model. The greatest concerns are biodiversity and environmental\nservices. Six main clusters related to poverty are ecosystem, health risk, economic and environmental development, natural resources and food production, children, women and inequality, and urban poverty. Therefore,\necological and environmental degradation and poverty are linked, and must be tackled together. The win-win\nstrategies on local and national levels that both restore the environment, enhance incomes and ensure a sustainable livelihood are needed. The joint approaches of topic modelling and bibliometrics are expected to be\nfurther applied in ecological and environmental economics and management fields. Our findings provide a\ntheoretical basis for further research and decision making and contribute to sustainable development.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xin Cheng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Chuanmin Shuai.,, Jiali Liu.,Jing Wang.,Yue Liu.,Wenjing Li.,Jing Shuai"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Integrated framework Topic modelling Ecology Environment Poverty Research concerns", "Sumber": "Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment 267 (2018) 1\u201314", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Jan 2019"}
