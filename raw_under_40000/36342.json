{"Nomor": 36342, "Judul": "Towards a Formal Approach to Generative Design: An Assistant System for the Creation of Artefact Models", "Abstrak": "In this paper we propose a formal approach to the generative design\nof artefacts. The founding idea, bridging the gap between the domain of\narchitectural artefacts and the field of ontologies, is to represent the notion of\nspecies as it exists in the context of generative design by the concept of class\nexisting in the field of formal ontologies. In this paper we propose an artefact\ndesign methodology and a system based on it that assists a designer in the\nbuilding process of artefact 3D models. The implemented system is structured\nin three conceptual levels: the Design Strategy, the Computational Model, and\nthe 3D graphical rendering system. The Computational model has been defined\nand developed using the Frame Logic formalism. The proposed methodology is\nindependent of specific modelling environments. In this paper we also present\nmethodological directions to couple artefact representations with 3D rendering\nsystems.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Antonio Calabrese [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Carlo Coppola, Salvatore Masecchia, Francesco Mele, Antonio Origlia, Antonio Sorgente, and Oliviero Talamo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Intelligent System, Human Computer Interaction, Generative Design.", "Sumber": "F.
