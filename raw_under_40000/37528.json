{"Nomor": 37528, "Judul": "Bubble-Propelled Jellyfish-like Micromotors for DNA Sensing", "Abstrak": "A chemically powered jellyfish-like micromotorwas proposed by using a multimetallic shell and a DNAassembly with catalase decorations modified on the concavesurface to simulate the umbrella-shaped body and the musclefibers on the inner umbrella of jellyfish. Relying on thecatalytic generation of oxygen gas by catalase in H2O2fuel, thejellyfish-like micromotor showed good bubble-propelledmotion in different biomedia with speed exceeding 209?ms?1in 1.5% H2O2. The jellyfish-like micromotors could also beapplied for motion detection of DNA based on a displacementhybridization-triggered catalase release. The proposed jelly-fish-like micromotors showed advantages of easy fabrication, good motion ability, sensitive motion detection of DNA, and goodstability and reproducibility, indicating considerable promise for biological application.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Xueqing_Zhang_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164888"}, "Penulis": "Xueqing Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Chengtao Chen, Jie Wu,and Huangxian Ju"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "micromotor, bubble-propulsion, bio-inspiration, DNA assembly, motion detection", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
