{"Nomor": 37815, "Judul": "The carnivalesque, parody and irony in the  contemporary american visual art: Project  Womanhouse, a case study", "Abstrak": "The  present  paper  situates  its  concerns  at  the  crossroads  of  Gender  Studies,  visual  art  and \nfeminist  theories  in  its  attempt  at  investigating  an  (in)famous  1972  art  installation  by \nAmerican  artists  Judy  Chicago  and  Miriam  Shapiro,  Project  Womanhouse.  Primarily grounded on contemporary theories of gender as a cultural construct, this study is concerned with  how  this  particular  instance  of  the  contemporary  American  visual  arts  deals  with  the deconstruction  and  reconstruction  of  gender  through parody  and  irony.  The  study  also discusses  the  problematic  viewpoint  of  feminism  on gender  as  too  narrow-sighted  and restrictive,  while  opting  for  the  term  feminine  to describe  the  gender-related  statements  of the artists under scrutiny.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ILEANA BOTESCU-SIRE?EANU [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Irony, parody, gender stereotypes, visual culture, America n visual arts", "Sumber": "Bulletin of the  Transilvania  University of Bra ? ov  Series IV: Philology and Cultural Studies \u2022 Vol. 7  (56) No. 1 - 2014", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Apr 2019"}
