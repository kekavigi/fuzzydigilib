{"Nomor": 37434, "Judul": "Application of Glaser?Hay Diyne Coupling To Constrain N??Amino Acid Amides via a N?N Bridge", "Abstrak": "We present the application of a Glaser?Hay diyne coupling for the synthesis of conformationally constrained\nN?-amino acid amides with different diyne ring sizes. Twelve-membered rings were the smallest rings that could be prepared by this approach. We observed the formation of triethylammonium adducts in the cases of smaller (10- and 11-membered) rings. Calculation of the conformational barriers for the cyclization reactions of various ring sizes demonstrated that the formation of amino acid-derived smaller rings by this reaction is thermodynamically unfavorable.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Sergii Okorochenkov [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Viktor Krchnak"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Amino acid constrain, Glaser?Hay diyne coupling, medium-sized ring, solid-phase synthesis, triethylammonium adduct", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Mar 2019"}
