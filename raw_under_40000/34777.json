{"Nomor": 34777, "Judul": "Fast Spinning of Planets", "Abstrak": "Spin periods of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are specified by the analysis of the resonant motion of large satellites:   P=0.445(2)d , 0.448(1) d, 0.673(9) d and 0.561(7) d, respectively. They occur to be near-commensurate with   P0=9600.606(12)s , the period of the \u201ccosmic\u201d oscillation, discovered first in the Sun, then in other variable objects of the Universe. The like analysis of spin rates of the total set of the largest and fastest rotators of the Solar system (with mean diameters   ?500km  and   P<2d ,\u2014of planets, asteroids and satellites) resulted in the best commensurable, or \u201csynchronizing\u201d, timescale 9594(65) s, coinciding fairly well with   P0  too (the probability that the two timescales could agree by chance, is less than   10?5 ). True origin of this odd common resonance of our planetary system is unknown.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP V.A. KOTOV 1": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/157606"}, "Penulis": "V. A.
