In this context, EDP Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o has been\nworking with Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico (IST) in the development of an innovative icephobic coating that may be\napplied on conductors of already existing high-voltage (HV) or medium-voltage (MV) overhead power lines, in\norder to prevent ice and snow accretion. Building on EDP Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o\u2019s requirements, IST developed\nseven different solutions based on nanocomposite materials. These were applied onto small ACSR 50 conductor\nsamples that were placed at a high altitude location in Serra da Estrela. The team has been registering\naccretion on bare and coated sample conductors, in order to assess the effectiveness of the solutions and\naging impact on their behaviour. The performance of the most promising solution will be assessed in a pilot\nexperience on a critical overhead power line, using load cells that will permanently measure the mechanical\ntension of both coated and uncoated conductors. This study gives an overview of the problem, existing market\nsolutions and describes the innovative coatings developed by IST and EDP Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o, as well as the results\nobtained so far.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Rui Bernardo [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Generalities", "Kata Kunci": "Network components", "Sumber": "24th International Conference & Exhibition on Electricity Distribution (CIRED)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Dany Yunandar", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Des 2018"}
