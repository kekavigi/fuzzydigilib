{"Nomor": 36446, "Judul": "Composition of Bamboo Walls and Compressed Earth Block Walls in a Simple House that Produces Energy Efficient to Heat and Embodied Energy in Indonesia", "Abstrak": "Building materials have a major effect on the depletion of natural resources and energy in the world.\nLocal raw materials are some of the best building materials, which can be found in every location; for\nexample, compressed earth block and bamboo. This study adds to previous studies on compressed earth\nblocks without using combustion in the same location. The study focused on how to obtain a rural\nhousing design by using compressed earth block walls and bamboo walls, which are adaptive to local\nmaterials and climate. Moreover, the ratio of the use of the compressed earth block walls with the walls is\nalso examined to produce optimum embodied energy and heat energy buildings. The method used in this\nstudy was to analyze the characteristics of the compressed earth block and bamboo materials used as wall\nconstruction. While embodied energy and heat energy were calculated by using simulation model\nbuilding, the heat energy calculation was found using the Archipak program. The results of the study\nshows that the optimum wall materials for the embodied energy and heat energy was compressed earth\nblock with an area of 11 m2 and bamboo walls with an area of 19 m2.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Vincentius Totok NOERWASITO [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Building materials", "Kata Kunci": "Compressed earth block, bamboo, simulation model, embodied energy, heat energy", "Sumber": "http://wjst.wu.ac.th", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur \u00a0\n                                     Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Mar 2019"}
