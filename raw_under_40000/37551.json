{"Nomor": 37551, "Judul": "Bifunctional Pyrrolidin-2-one Terminated Manganese OxideNanoparticles for Combined Magnetic Resonance and FluorescenceImaging", "Abstrak": "Multimodal probes are an asset for simplified,improved medical imaging. In particular,fluorescence andmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are sought-after combinedcapabilities. Here, we show that pyrrolidin-2-one-capped man-ganese oxide nanoparticles (MnOpyrrNPs) combine MRI withfluorescence microscopy to function as efficient bifunctional bio-nanoprobes. We employ a one-pot synthesis forca.10 nm MnONPs, wherein manganese(II) 2,4-pentadionate is thermallydecomposed using pyrrolidin-2-one as a solvent and cappingligand. TheMnOpyrrNPs are soluble in water without any furtherpostsynthetic modifications. Ther1relaxivity andr2/r1ratioindicate that these NPs are potentialT1MRI contrast agents atclinical (3 T) and ultrahigh (9.4 T) magneticfields. Serendip-itously, the as-prepared NPs are photoluminescent. The unexpected luminescence is ascribed to the modification of thepyrrolidin-2-one during the thermal treatment.MnOpyrrNPs are successfully used to enablefluorescence microscopy of HeLacells, demonstrating bifunctional imaging capabilities. A low cytotoxic response in two distinct cell types (HeLa, HepG2)supports the suitability ofMnOpyrrNPs for biological imaging applications.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Abhinandan_Banerjee_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164940"}, "Penulis": "Abhinandan Banerjee [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Gabriel E.
