{"Nomor": 37819, "Judul": "NEURO FUZZY MODEL FORPREDICTINGTHE DYNAMIC CHARACTERISTICSOF BEAMS", "Abstrak": "An adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is introduced to predict the\ndynamic behavior of beams. The effects of axial forces and large displacements are considered in\nthe analysis. A database of tests for the dynamic characteristics of beams is developed from the\nexperimental tests. The responses of nonlinear vibration force for the single and multiple-stepped\nbeams are calculated from the finite element method (FEM), experimental tests and neuro-fuzzy\nmodel for comparison. The neuro-fuzzy model provides a general framework for the combination\nof neural networks and fuzzy logic. It is more flexible with more options of incorporating the fuzzy\nnature of the real-world system and is an useful estimation tool for the dynamic characteristics of\nbeams. Therefore, ANFIS can be a useful tool for dynamic behaviour analysis of multiple-stepped\nbeams subjected to axial loads and large displacement.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Imad O.
