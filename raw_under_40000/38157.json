{"Nomor": 38157, "Judul": "Black hole possibly ate neutron star", "Abstrak": "The newly upgraded detectors of the LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave observatories have sent astronomers on a wild ride. Last week, the detectors heard gravitational waves from a merger of two neutron stars for only the second time \u2014 creating a frenzy of activity. Just a day later, the observatories made the first possible sighting of a black hole devouring a neutron star. If confirmed, it would be the first evidence that the Universe harbours such binary systems. Observations of their dramatic collisions can produce a wealth of information that no other event could provide, including precise tests of the general theory of relativity\nand measuring the Universe\u2019s rate of expansion.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "DAVIDE CASTELVECCHI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Astronomi", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Astrofisika", "Sumber": "2 MAY 2019 | VOL 569 | NATURE | 15", "Staf Input/Edit": "pustaka bosscha", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Mei 2019"}
