{"Nomor": 32686, "Judul": "The impact of exposure to films of natural and built environments on state body appreciation", "Abstrak": "Previous work has shown that exposure to images of nature results in elevated state body appreciation,\nbut static images may lack ecological validity. Here, we examined the impact of exposure to short films of\nsimulated, first-person walks in natural or built environments. Thirty-six university students completed\na measure of state body appreciation before and after watching films of either a walk in a natural or\na built environment created specifically for the present study. Two weeks later, they completed the\nsame task but watched the other film type. Results indicated that exposure to the film of a natural\nenvironment resulted in significantly elevated state body appreciation (d = 0.66). There was no significant\nchange in state body appreciation following exposure to the film ofthe built environment(d = 0.14). These\nfindings suggest that exposure to films depicting the natural environment may promote immediate,\nmoderate-sized improvements in state body image.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Viren Swami [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": [", Mark Pickering.,David Barron.,Shreepali Patel"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "State body appreciation Natural environment Built environment Nature Film", "Sumber": "Body Image 26 (2018) 70\u201373", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Des 2018"}
