{"Nomor": 33565, "Judul": "HIGH-PRESSURE DC MAGNETIC MEASUREMENTS ON A BISDISELENAZOLYL RADICAL FERROMAGNET USING A VIBRATING-COIL SQUID MAGNETOMETER", "Abstrak": "The high-pressure magnetic properties of the iodo-substituted bisdiselenazolyl radical ferromagnet IBPSSEt have been studied by vibrating-coil SQUID magnetometry. The magnetic state at a pressure (P) of approximately 2 GPa has the highest Curie temperature (TC) of 27.5 K, and displays an ideal three-dimensional (3D) ferromagnetic interaction network. The value of TC observed by ac magnetic susceptibility measurements is consistent with that obtained from dc measurements below approximately 4 GPa. Field-cooled dc measurements at more elevated pressures reveal a slow evolution of magnetic ordering, so that atP >6 GPa the structure may be described in terms of a 1D ferromagnetic chain with predominantly antiferromagnetic lateral (interchain) interactions, in accord with the results of density functional theory calculations.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "KUNIHIKO IRIE [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["KEISUKE SHIBAYAMA,", "MASAKI MITO,", "SEISHI TAKAGI,", "MAMORU ISHIZUKA,", "KRISTINA LEKIN,", "AND RICHARD T.
