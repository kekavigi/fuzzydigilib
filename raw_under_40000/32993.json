{"Nomor": 32993, "Judul": "Understanding the connection between blasting and highwall stability", "Abstrak": "Surface mines continue to implement highwalls for several reasons, such as increasing recovery, improving margins, and justifying higher stripping ratios. Highwall stability is a complex issue that is dependent\nupon a variety of mining and geologic factors, and a safe design is necessary for a successful surface operation. To improve highwall stability, it is important to understand the connection between local geology\nand blasting. Explosives are employed throughout the mining industry for primary rock breakage. There\nare a number of controlled blasting techniques that can be implemented to improve highwall stability.\nThese include line drilling, smooth wall blasting, trim blasting, buffer blasting, air decking, and presplitting. Each of these techniques have associated advantages and disadvantages. Understanding local geology is necessary for selecting the appropriate controlled blasting technique. Furthermore, understanding\nthe limitations and conditions for successful implementation of each technique is necessary. A discussion\nof the impact of geologic conditions on highwall stability is provided. Additionally, discussion is provided\nfor the successful incorporation of the controlled blasting techniques listed above, and the associated\nmining and geologic factors that influence the selection and design of controlled blasting plans.\nFinally, a new methodology is proposed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "R.
