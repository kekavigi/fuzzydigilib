{"Nomor": 32736, "Judul": "ANALYSIS OF PARAMETERS INGRANULAR SOLID HYDRODYNAMICS FORTRIAXIAL COMPRESSION TESTS", "Abstrak": "Granular materials are omnipresent in industries and in nature. For small strains,\nelastic-plastic and hypoplastic constitutive relations are widely used in engineering practice, but\nthey are not a significant reflection of the underlying physics. Under a unified thermodynamics\nframework explaining the physics of materials, granular solid hydrodynamics (GSH) was an extension\ntowards describing granular materials, not only solid-like, but also fluid-like behaviors.\nIn this paper, the fundamentals of GSH are briefly treated and then simplified to analyze quasistatic\ndeformations in triaxial compressions. The calculated stress-strain relations and volumetric\nstrain are compared with experimental results. The influences of the major parameters in GSH,\nespecially their cross coupling influences, are analyzed and their physical meanings are further\nclarified. After parameters were calibrated, the calculated stress values in the characteristic stress\nstate are found to be within 22% of tested values.Meanwhile, the energy dissipation during triaxial\ncompression is analyzed. The above results support and partially quantify GSH.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Shixiong Song [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Qicheng Sun, Feng Jin, Chuhan Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "granular solid hydrodynamics, granular materials, triaxial compressions, non-equilibrium state", "Sumber": "Science Direct", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Jan 2019"}
