[1] claimed that \u201cA new methodology to predict fracture\npressure from former calculations, MattheweKelly and Eaton are proposed.\u201d Also, Marbun et al.'s\npaper stated that \u201cA new value of Poisson's and a stress ratio of the formation were generated and\nthe accuracy of fracture gradient was improved.\u201d We found those all statements are incorrect and\nsome misleading concepts are revealed. An attempt to expose the method of fracture gradient\ndetermination from industry practice also appears to solidify that our arguments are acceptable to\nagainst improper Marbun et al.'s claims.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "FARIZAL HAKIKI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Muizzuddin Shidqi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Fracture gradient Overburden pressure, Pore pressure, MattheweKelly's stress ratio, Eaton's stress ratio, Poisson's ratio, Pressure safety drilling window, Geomechanics", "Sumber": "Petroleum 4 (2018) 1-6 - KeAi, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2017.07.001", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Jan 2019"}
