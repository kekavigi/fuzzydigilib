{"Nomor": 32651, "Judul": "NUMERICAL SOLUTION OF THE HA\ufffd\ufffdSSINSKI EQUATION FOR THE EQUILIBRIUM STATE OF A STORED ELECTRON BEAM", "Abstrak": "The longitudinal charge density of an electron beam in its equilibrium state is given by the solution of\nthe Ha\u00efssinski equation, which provides a stationary solution of the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. The\nphysical input is the longitudinal wake potential. We formulate the Ha\u00efssinski equation as a nonlinear\nintegral equation with the normalization integral stated as a functional of the solution. This equation can be\nsolved in a simple way by the matrix version of Newtons\u2019s iteration, beginning with the Gaussian as a first\nguess. We illustrate for several quasirealistic wake potentials. Convergence is extremely robust, even at\ncurrents much higher than nominal for the storage rings considered. The method overcomes limitations of\nearlier procedures, and provides the convenience of automatic normalization of the solution.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ROBERT WARNOCK [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "AMERICAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari \u00a0\n                                     Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Des 2018"}
