{"Nomor": 31133, "Judul": "MONTHLY ACTIVE USER IMPROVEMENT @ ABC APP USING SIX SIGMA", "Abstrak": "This research study is focused on one social media that starts as an instant messaging app called ABC. ABC is an app originally from Southeast Asia that started to enter Indonesian market in 2013. It has been struggling to maintain its monthly active user (MAU) during the past few months and wishes to get back on its feet as soon as possible.   \n \n \n\nThe problem occurred when it was unable to reach its MAU target which is 92 million in 2017. According to the control chart, it hasn\u201ft quite made a significant improvement since the beginning of 2017. It is also incapable to meet the target. Several projects have been done just as usual to increase the number of MAU but nothing happens. The number of MAU is going up and down without ever reaching the target. Based on 5 Whys Analysis, the root cause of the problem lies on two factors, the projects are held too often and the company cannot specialized each project based on specific target market criteria. The possible solution to implement is that the company should appoint someone to be the project planning coordinator. He or she will manage all executed projects so that they will align together to support company\u201fs mission. Hence, increase the number of MAU as well.   \n \n \n\nIn conclusion, this study is aimed to improve the number of Monthly Active User. This study will use Six Sigma approach to analyze deeply about the problem being faced and come up with proposal solution for ABC App to implement in order to increase MAU. This study uses DMAIC method because the method is suitable to improve existing processes. Control phase will also be implemented by using FMEA Table. FMEA Table helps project planning coordinator to control each project so that further risks can be prevented in the beginning", "Daftar File": {"2017 TA PP SULISTIA FITRIATY 1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/140578", "2017 TS PP SULISTIA F 1 - FULL TEXT.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/252181"}, "Penulis": "SULISTIA FITRIATY (NIM 19014179 Dr. Mursyid Hasan Basri, S.T., M.T.)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Mursyid Hasan Basri, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Performance, Business Development, Six Sigma, DMAIC", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Taupik Abidin \u00a0\n                                     Siti Sarah Nurbaity", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Jun 2018"}
