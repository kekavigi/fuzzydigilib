{"Nomor": 34850, "Judul": "Nitrification and total nitrogen removal in a super-oxygenated wetland", "Abstrak": "A novel surface flow wetland demonstrates high-rate nitrification by recirculating water supersaturated with oxygen. Design of the wetland was based on two hypotheses: (1) Oxygen supersaturation of a recirculating sidestream would support nitrification in a surface flow wetland at rates comparable to aerated subsurface flow\nwetlands, and; (2) Nitrification would be maintained in cold water conditions (0.5\u20135.0 \u00b0C) with minimal bioaugmentation using commercially available liquid suspensions of nitrifying bacteria. The wetland has an area of\n23,000 m2\n, of which the final 21,000 m2 is oxygenated. Mean flow was 863 m3 d?1\n. A downflow oxygen contactor\n(Speece cone) maintains dissolved oxygen at or over saturation in the wetland. Mean inflow NH3-N was\n8.0 mg L?1\n, mean outflow 0.6 mg L?1\n. In winter, nitrification began to degrade slowly at a water temperature\nof 0.5 \u00b0C to about half the summer rate but was restored by bioaugmentation with nitrifying bacteria in one\nmonth at water temperatures less than 3.3 \u00b0C. Determination of nitrification rates by a first-order, tanks-inseries model (P-k-C*) was hindered by the method detection limit (0.2 mg L?1 NH3-N) of analytical methods\nand the inherent limitations of first order models for complete nitrification. The median monthly nitrification\nareal rate coefficient from April 2016 through June 2017 was at least 216 m y?1\n, which is 15 times greater\nthan median passive wetland literature rates. High nitrification rates allow for at least a 90% reduction of required\ntreatment area for nitrification at approximately one third the capital cost of aerated subsurface flow wetlands.\nDenitrification rates were well within observed literature values. The peak monthly mean denitrification rate, observed in June 2017, was 76 m y?1\n, but winter denitrification rates were close to zero.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "David Austin [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Rafael Vazquez-Burney.,Gary Dyke.,Timothy King"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Nitrification Oxygen Treatment wetland Speece cone Denitrification", "Sumber": "Science of the Total Environment 652 (2019) 307\u2013313", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Feb 2019"}
