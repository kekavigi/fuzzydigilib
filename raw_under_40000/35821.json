The framework\nuses a multi-chain Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampler, which is a hybrid of DiffeRential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis and Adaptive Metropolis samplers. The inversion framework is tested by estimating reservoir-fluid saturations and porosity based on marine seismic and Controlled-Source Electromagnetic data. The multi-chain\nMarkov-chain Monte Carlo is scalable in terms of the number of chains, and is useful for computationally demanding Bayesian model calibration in scientific and engineering problems. As a demonstration, the approach\nis used to efficiently and accurately estimate the porosity and saturations in a representative layered synthetic\nreservoir. The results indicate that the seismic Amplitude Versus Angle and Controlled-Source Electromagnetic\njoint inversion provides better estimation of reservoir saturations than the seismic Amplitude Versus Angle\nonly inversion, especially for the parameters in deep layers. The performance of the inversion approach for various levels of noise in observational data was evaluated \u2014 reasonable estimates can be obtained with noise levels\nup to 25%. Sampling efficiency due to the use of multiple chains was also checked and was found to have almost\nlinear scalability", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Huiying Ren [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jaideep Ray, Zhangshuan Hou, Maoyi Huang, Jie Bao, Laura Swiler"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Seismic Amplitude Versus Angle Controlled-Source Electromagnetic Joint inversion Bayesian Multi-chain Markov-chain Monte Carlo", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 147 (2017) 68\u20138, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.10.004", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Mar 2019"}
