{"Nomor": 37658, "Judul": "Jitter analysis of a phase-locked digital timing recovery system", "Abstrak": "An analytical approach is presented for\nthe jitter performance of a timing recovery circuit\nconsisting of a hard-limiter, an exclusive-or gate,\nfollowed by a second-order phase-locked loop.\nExact expressions for the autocorrelation function\nand the power spectral density of the zerocrossing\njitter in the data signal are derived, and\nthen the phase jitter variance of the timing wave,\ngenerated at the output of the timing circuit, is\nobtained analytically as a function of various\nsystem parameters. Finally, numerical results and\na comparative performance analysis show that\nconsiderable improvement can be achieved in\njitter performance in addition to having the\nadvantage of low cost and simple hardware implementation.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Prof. E.
