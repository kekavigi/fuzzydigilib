{"Nomor": 34702, "Judul": "SHARP-EDGED GEOMETRIC OBSTACLES IN MICROFLUIDICS PROMOTEDEFORMABILITY-BASED SORTING OF CELLS", "Abstrak": "Sorting cells based on their intrinsic properties is a highly desirable objective, since\nchanges in cell deformability are often associated with various stress conditions and\ndiseases. Deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) devices offer high precision for rigid\nspherical particles, while their success in sorting deformable particles remains limited due\nto the complexity of cell traversal in DLD devices.We employ mesoscopic hydrodynamics\nsimulations and demonstrate prominent advantages of sharp-edged DLD obstacles for\nprobing deformability properties of red blood cells (RBCs). By consecutive sharpening\nof the pillar shape from circular to diamond to triangular cross-section, a pronounced cell\nbending around an edge is achieved, serving as a deformability sensor. Bending around\nthe edge is the primary mechanism which governs the traversal of RBCs through such a\nDLD device. This strategy requires an appropriate degree of cell bending by fluid stresses,\nwhich can be controlled by the flow rate, and exhibits good sensitivity to moderate changes\nin cell deformability. We expect that similar mechanisms should be applicable for the\ndevelopment of novel DLD devices that target intrinsic properties of many other cells.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ZUNMIN ZHANG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["WEI CHIEN,", "EWAN HENRY,", "DMITRY A.
