{"Nomor": 37639, "Judul": "Single-Photon Distillation via a Photonic Parity Measurement Using Cavity QED", "Abstrak": "Single photons with tailored temporal profiles are a vital resource for future quantum networks. Here we\ndistill them out of custom-shaped laser pulses that reflect from a single atom strongly coupled to an optical\nresonator. A subsequent measurement on the atom is employed to herald a successful distillation. Out of\nvacuum-dominated light pulses, we create single photons with fidelity 66(1)%, two-and-more-photon\nsuppression 95.5(6)%, and a Wigner function with negative value ?0.125\u00f06\u00de. Our scheme applied to stateof-the-art fiber resonators could boost the single-photon fidelity to up to 96%.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Severin Daiss [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Stephan Welte,", "Bastian Hacker, Lin Li,", "and Gerhard Rempe"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 122, 133603 (2019); \u00a9 2019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Apr 2019"}
