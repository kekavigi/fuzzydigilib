{"Nomor": 32650, "Judul": "FROM SCATTERING AMPLITUDES TO CLASSICAL POTENTIALS IN THE POST-MINKOWSKIAN EXPANSION", "Abstrak": "We combine tools from effective field theory and generalized unitarity to construct a map between onshell\nscattering amplitudes and the classical potential for interacting spinless particles. For general\nrelativity, we obtain analytic expressions for the classical potential of a binary black hole system at second\norder in the gravitational constant and all orders in velocity. Our results exactly match all known results up\nto fourth post-Newtonian order, and offer a simple check of future higher order calculations. By design,\nthese methods should extend to higher orders in perturbation theory.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "CLIFFORD CHEUNG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["IRA Z.
