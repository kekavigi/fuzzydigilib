{"Nomor": 32996, "Judul": "Marchenko scheme based internal multiple reflection elimination in acoustic wavefield", "Abstrak": "Marchenko imaging is a methodology to image the subsurface with two important properties: (1)accurate amplitude\nand (2)free from free-surface and internal multiple artefacts. It requires an estimate of the first arrival\nof the focusing function which is commonly obtained from a macro velocity model. Inspired by this limitation,\na projected Marchenko scheme has been introduced from which an internal multiple reflection elimination\nscheme has been derived. This internal multiple reflection elimination scheme requires an estimate of the\ntwo-way travel time surface of a selected horizon in the subsurface instead of a macro model. In order to make\nit totallymodel free we have rewritten the scheme by replacing the estimate of the two-way travel time surface\nby a fixed truncation for all traces. The output of the current scheme contains primary reflections without contamination\nfrom internal multiple reflections. We apply this scheme to a 2D numerical example to illustrate\nthe procedure of this method and show how the internalmultiple reflection eliminated data set can be retrieved\nand the migration image is improved.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lele Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Myrna Staring"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Marchenko imaging Internal multiple reflections Artefact-free image", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 159 (2018) 429\u2013433, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.09.024", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Jan 2019"}
