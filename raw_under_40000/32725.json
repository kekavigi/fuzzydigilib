{"Nomor": 32725, "Judul": "AMODIFIED TORSIONPENDULUMFOR MEASURING THE SHEARMODULUS OFA SINGLE MICRO-SIZED FILAMENT", "Abstrak": "A modified torsion pendulum apparatus is developed for measuring the shear modulus\nof single filaments with uniform micro-sized diameter. A single filament fixed at both ends and\nwith a ring-shaped mass attached at the middle is used as a clamped-clamped torsion pendulum.\nThe shear modulus of single filaments can be expressed as a function of the oscillation frequency\nof the torsion pendulum. The oscillation motion is measured with a CCD laser displacement sensor,\nand its frequency is determined by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method. The shear\nmoduli of three types of filaments: copper wires, tungsten wires and carbon fibers are accurately\nmeasured with this technique. It is found that the size effect in shear moduli of both copper wires\nand tungsten wires is minor. Finally, the error analysis of our measurement technique is presented\nin detail.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "D abiao L iu Yuming He   [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pe ng Hu, Z hip e ng Gan, Huaming D ing"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "torsion pendulum, shear modulus, size effect, single filament", "Sumber": "Science Direct", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan \u00a0\n                                     Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Jan 2019"}
