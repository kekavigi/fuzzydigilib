{"Nomor": 32795, "Judul": "Permeability Prediction In Wells Using Flow Zone Indicator (FZI)", "Abstrak": "Estimation of permeability values in uncored wells but logged intervals is a worldwide challenge usually\nencountered in all reservoirs. Permeability estimation is a major risk task in petroleum engineering, as\nit is a necessity for reservoir description and performance (fluid flow).\nPermeability obtained from core measurement is usually limited due to the high cost of getting core\nsamples and toilsome analysis required, scoring only being done for certain good sections and well\nlogs are used for predicting permeability in sections where core permeability are unavailable. This\nmakes core derived permeability cost effective and feasible.\nFor this work, statistical and graphical measurement was considered for estimating permeability.\nStatistical methods employing regression model and flow zone indicator (FZI) were utilized in establishing a mathematical correlation between core data and well logs using equations obtained from\nplotted graphs. FZImean values obtained from the log-log plot of RQI against ?z, was used to classify\nthe well into different hydraulic flow units (HFUs).\nStatistical methods were tested using a sample size of over 960 measured permeability data gotten\nfrom five wells in an oil field, located in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Results obtained from\nclassifying data into hydraulic flow unit using FZI showed better correlation R2 compared to the regression\nmodel.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "LARRY O.
