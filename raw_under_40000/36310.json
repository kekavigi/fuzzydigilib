Antioxidant activity of organosulfur achieve optimal results in phase Gap2 owned by the cells that are in the stage of mitosis. In previous studies, garlic oil showed protective activity against rat sperm DNA damage induced by Sarimukti municipal landfill leachate during meiosis stage, allegedly caused by a decrease in ROS levels in testis tissue. It can be expected that given garlic oil at the stage of mitosis of spermatogonia will show a better activity in decreasing DNA damage. To prove that declining ROS in testicular tissue due to the presence of organosulfur as an antioxidant, this study measured Mallondialdehyde (MDA) and total protein levels as a marker of oxidative stress. Seventy-five adult male Wistar rats (10 weeks, 225-275 g) were divided into two major groups, a group used for the measurement of rat sperm DNA damage, and a group used for the measurement of oxidative stress markers of testicular tissue. Each treatment group received pre-treatment and co-treatment process to prove antioxidant activity of garlic oil on germ cell DNA damage. To measure sperm DNA damage, 50 rats were divided into groups that received a combination of test preparation: (a) garlic oil (100, 225, 500 mg / kg bw) and leachate 63%, (b) olive oil and leachate 63% and (c) Vit. E 50 IU and leachate 63%. Garlic oil, olive oil, and vitamin E given by gavage. Two hours after the gavage, followed by intraperitoneal administration of leachate. Test preparation lasts for 14 days. After settling for 45 days to complete the cycle of spermatogenesis, on day 46 all animals in the test were euthanized. Cauda epidydymis cement suspension was isolated for analyzing DNA damage levels determined by Sperm Chromatin Disperssion (SCD) Assay. Level of sperm DNA damage was measured by a score of size panhandle sperm chromatin (Halo). To measure levels of oxidative stress markers of testicular tissue, 25 rats were divided into groups that received a combination of test preparation, namely: (a) the garlic oil 500 mg / kg b.b and leachate 63%, (b) Vit. E 50 IU and leachate 63%, (c) olive oil and leachate 63%, (d) 63% leachate and (e) aquabidestilata as blank control. Provision of test materials conducted for 14 days. On day 15, all rats were euthanized then testicular tissues was isolated. Levels of oxidative stress markers of testicular tissue then measured by using Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substanse (TBARS) assay and Bradford Assay. The results of research both in the group who had pre-treatment or co-treatment showed decreased DNA damage levels along with increased doses of garlic oil. Decreasing DNA damage are more significant in the treatment group received pre-treatment. Decline in sperm DNA damage are becoming available at the lowest dose and achieve optimal results at the highest dose, although the result was lower 1,27% of the positive control. The results of measurements of oxidative stress markers in the group given garlic oil at a dose of 500 mg / kg b.b showed the lowest levels of MDA, and the highest protein content network, though not equal results on a\niv\nsample of normal tissue. This indicates that the antioxidant activity occurred from component of garlic oil against oxidative damage induced testicular tissue of components of leachate, although not returning cells into normal conditions. Organosulfur component of garlic oil allegedly decreased ROS levels in testicular tissue through antagonistic interactions are thought to be caused by ROS scavanging process, as well as an increase in the synthesis of natural antioxidants in the cells. Additionally, the mitotic phase of the cell spermatogonia have a rest period (Gap2) longer suspected join and support the antioxidant activity of garlic oil in the cell. Increased levels of natural antioxidants and ROS scavanging process in the network will decreases ROS levels, which in turn decreases the likelihood of interaction ROS other biomolecules, especially lipids internal membranes of cells indicated by decreased levels of MDA network. Based on the results of this study it can be concluded that garlic oil provide antioxidant activity which is represented by decreasing in DNA damage to sperm cells which is accompanied by decreasing in oxidative stress markers in testicular tissue.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Nurfitri Yulianty [20614013]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ayda Trisnawaty Yusuf, MS"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Biologi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Ilmu dan Teknologi Hayati", "Subjek": "Life sciences ; biology", "Kata Kunci": "Garlic Oil, leachate, DNA damage, Sperm, TPAS Sarimukti, ROS, MDA, SCD Assay, Wistar Rat", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "agus slamet", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Mar 2019"}
