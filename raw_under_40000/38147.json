Governments\nand planning bodies struggle to heed and apply the abundance of unintegrated research that\nlinks aspects of the urban environment with urban residents\u2019 wellbeing. In order to promote\nhuman wellbeing in cities, a number of key features of the urban environment should be\npromoted. The medical science, urban ecology and urban design research already recognises\nthe importance of some aspects, including providing walkable spaces, community space and\ngreenspace. We argue that in practice, the provision of these three features is insufficient for\nhuman wellbeing. Emerging research demonstrates the importance of biodiversity and ecosystem functions to wellbeing. This paper outlines the concept of wellbeing and provides a\nsummary of the three established features of urban environments that enhance residents\u2019 lives:\nthe provision of walkable, community and greenspace. We then outline the importance of two\nvital but often overlooked links in the discussion of how urban planning contributes to\nwellbeing: biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Until governments and policies recognise\nthe importance of these two elements, urban design and management for wellbeing is at best\nsimplistic. It is important for biodiversity and ecosystem function to be considered during the\ndesign decision process. Urban designers and ecologists should recognise that their work has\nthe potential to contribute to human wellbeing by integrating biodiversity and ecosystem\nfunctioning in their research.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lucy Taylor [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dieter F.
