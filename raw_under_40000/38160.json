{"Nomor": 38160, "Judul": "Nonprofit perceptions of local government performance in affordable housing", "Abstrak": "Purpose \u2013 The purpose of this paper is to examine how executive directors of nonprofit\norganizations perceive local government performance in affordable housing. It builds on a larger\nbody of research concerning the affordable housing activities of government and community-based\nnonprofit housing organizations at the local level.\nDesign/methodology/approach \u2013 This analysis is based on a national survey of neighborhood\nhousing services (NHS) organizations funded by Neighborworksw America. The survey included\nquestions about local government performance in affordable housing and perceptions of factors\ninfluencing local government funding decisions. Survey data were supplemented with information\ngathered from the Neighborworksw America website.\nFindings \u2013 The findings of this paper indicate that NHS organizations are not completely satisfied\nwith local government performance. Local government performance in affordable housing received\nlower grades than other levels of government, as well as intermediary organizations and private\nfinancial institutions. This dissatisfaction is expressed through nonprofit fields in which these\norganizations are embedded. These fields have witnessed declining governmental support for\naffordable housing and expanding influence from philanthropic organizations and the private sector.\nOriginality/value \u2013 This paper highlights the need for government to assume a broader and more\nactivist role in affordable housing policy. In essence, government needs to assume a more activist\nstance and forge stronger partnerships with nonprofits in response to the growing influence of\nintermediary organizations and the private sector in nonprofit fields. This would temper some of the\nexcesses brought on by the devolution and nonprofitization of affordable housing policy and\nneoliberal influences on public policy more generally", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Robert Mark Silverman [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Housing, Non-profit organizations, Local government, United States of America, Public policy", "Sumber": "https://search.proquest.com/docview/232425597/fulltextPDF/3009DFD7E79F4A4BPQ/5?accountid=31562", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Mei 2019"}
