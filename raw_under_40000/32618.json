{"Nomor": 32618, "Judul": "Irradiation E ff ects on Polymer-Grafted Gold Nanoparticles for Cancer Therapy", "Abstrak": "In the context of cancer treatment, gold nanoparticles\n(AuNPs) are considered as very promising radiosensitizers. Here, well-\nde\nfi\nned polymer-grafted AuNPs were synthesized and studied under\ngamma irradiation to better understand the involved radiosensitizing\nmechanisms. First, various water-soluble and well-de\nfi\nned thiol-function-\nalized homopolymers and copolymers were obtained through atom\ntransfer radical polymerization. They were then used as ligands in the\none-step synthesis of AuNPs, which resulted in stable hybrid metal\n?\npolymer nanoparticles. Second, these nano-objects were irradiated in\nsolution by\n?\nrays at di\nff\nerent doses. Structures were fully characterized\nthrough size exclusion chromatography, small-angle X-ray scattering, and\nsmall-angle neutron scattering measurements, prior to and after\nirradiation. We were thus able to quantify and to localize radiation\nimpacts onto the grafted polymers, revealing the production sites of\nreactive species around AuNPs. Both external and near-surface scissions were observed. Interestingly, the ratio between these\ntwo e\nff\nects was found to vary according to the nature of polymer ligands. Medium-range and long-distance dose enhancements\ncould not be identi\nfi\ned from the calculated scission yields, but several mechanisms were considered to explain high yields found\nfor near-surface scissions. Then cytotoxicity was shown to be equivalent for both nonirradiated and irradiated polymer-grafted\nNPs, which suggested that released polymer fragments were nontoxic. Finally, the potential to add bioactive molecules such as\nanticancer drugs has been explored by grafting doxorubicin onto the polymer corona. This may lead to nano-objects combining\nboth radiosensitization and chemotherapy e\nff\nects. This work is the\nfi\nrst one to study in details the impact of radiation on\nradiosensitizing nano-objects combining physical, chemical, and biological analyses.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Marine Le Goas [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Aure ? lie Paquirissamy", "Dorra Gargouri", "Giulia Fadda", "Fabienne Testard", "Caroline Aymes-Chodur", "Emile Jubeli", "Thierry Pourcher", "Be ? atrice Cambien", "Serge Palacin", "Jean-Philippe Renault", "Geraldine Carrot", "Geraldine Carrot"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "polymer-grafted AuNPs, irradiation, radiosensitization, SANS, SAXS, cytotoxicity, doxorubicin", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
