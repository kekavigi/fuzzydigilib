{"Nomor": 35696, "Judul": "Lateral biases in lighting of abstract artwork", "Abstrak": "Previous  studies  examining  perceptual  biases  in  art  have  revealed  that  paintings\ntend to be lit from above and to the left. Abstract images provide a way of testing\nfor the left-light bias while controlling for cues such as posing biases, ground line,\nshadows, and reflections. A total of 42 participants completed a task that required\nmoving a \u2018\u2018virtual flashlight\u2019\u2019 across the surface of abstract images presented on a\ncomputer screen: 20 images (presented both right-side-up and upside down) were\nused in the study. The participant\u2019s only instruction was to \u2018\u2018light the painting in a\nway  that  is  most  aesthetically  pleasing  to  you\u2019\u2019.  As  predicted,  participants  on\naverage focused the \u2018\u2018virtual flashlight\u2019\u2019 in the top left quadrant. This study reveals\nthat lateral lighting biases in artwork are not dependent on perception of local light\nsource or interactions with discrete, concrete visual representations in the artwork.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "David A.
