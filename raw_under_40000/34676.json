{"Nomor": 34676, "Judul": "Supramolecular Switching Surface for Antifouling and Bactericidal Activities", "Abstrak": "Antibacterial materials are often bothered by\nthe problems of drug-resistance-induction and adhesion-toinvalidation,\ncoming from the exposure of reusable bactericidal\nmaterials before or after utilization. Herein, an efficient and\neasily transformable supramolecular switching surface for\nantifouling and bactericidal was successfully fabricated,\nthrough introducing a negatively charged macrocyclic host\nS6-corona[3]arene[3]pyridazine (S6-CAP) to a contact-killing\nsurface constructed by a positively charged amphiphilic\nbactericide. The S6-CAP was able to fully switch off the bactericidal activity and make the surfaces antifouling. After switched\non by simply washing off much of S6-CAP, the bactericidal activity was even better than the original contact-killing surfaces.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lingda Zeng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yukun Wu, Jiang-Fei Xu, Shu Wang, Xi Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "supramolecular chemistry at interfaces, biomaterial, supramolecular switch, bactericidal surface, antifouling", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Feb 2019"}
