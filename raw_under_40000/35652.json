{"Nomor": 35652, "Judul": "Morphology and Reactivity Evolution of HCP and FCC Ru Nanoparticles under CO Atmosphere", "Abstrak": "The morphology change of metallic nanoparticles induced by the interaction of gas molecules with nanoparticles is a very important surface chemistry process in heterogeneous catalysis. Here, we performed a thorough study to provide understanding of the influence of CO adsorption on theoretically established Ru nanoparticle models through an approach combining density functional theory, Wulff construction, and ab initio atomistic thermodynamics. The morphology of constructed Ru nanoparticles undergoes significant evolution upon changing CO coverage, exposed temperature, and pressure.....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Peng Zhao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zhi Cao, Xingchen Liu, Pengju Ren, Dong-Bo Cao, Hongwei Xiang, Haijun Jiao, Yong Yang, Yong-Wang Li, Xiao-Dong Wen"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Wulff construction, ruthenium nanoparticle, density functional theory, CO adsorption, atomistic thermodynamics, activity", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Feb 2019"}
