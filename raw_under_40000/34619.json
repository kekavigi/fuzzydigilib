{"Nomor": 34619, "Judul": "Synthesis, characterization and catalytic application of ZnPO molecular sieve in wastewater system", "Abstrak": "In the present work, phosphatizing and organic double wastewater were reused to synthesize ZnPO\nmolecular sieves with a hydrothermal method. Enhanced application of the samples was carried out\nthrough cyclohexane oxidation and Michael addition alkylation reaction. The removal efficiency of Zn, P\nin phosphatizing wastewater was over 90%. The characterizations like the crystallite phases, surface\nmorphology and porous features were also confirmed. The catalytic efficiencies of ZnPO prepared in\ndouble wastewater system had a good catalytic performance in cyclohexane oxidation and Michael\naddition reactions, which were much higher than that of the catalyst prepared via simulated system. The\nsurface features of catalysts had a close relationship with such results. These outstanding characters were\nattributed to more active centers formation, which were brought through interaction of Zn, P, and other\nmetal ions in phosphatizing wastewater, as well as the huge surface area caused by the organic materials\nin organic wastewater.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ying Sun [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Qian Yang.,Yang Zhang.,Lanying Ge.,Yunfeng Xu.,Guangren Qian"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Wastewaters ZnPO molecular sieves Catalytic application", "Sumber": "Journal of Cleaner Production 213 (2019) 1165-1171", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Feb 2019"}
