{"Nomor": 36384, "Judul": "Tunable Coacervation of Well-Defined Homologous Polyanions and Polycations by Local Polarity", "Abstrak": "The ionic complexation of polyelectrolytes is an important mechanism underlying many important biological\nprocesses and technical applications. The main driving force for complexation is electrostatic, which is known to be affected by the local polarity near charge centers, but the impact of which on the complexation of polyelectrolytes remains poorly explored. We developed a homologous series of well-defined polyelectrolytes with identical backbone structures, controlled molecular weights, and tunable local polarity to modulate the solvation environment near charged groups. A multitude of systematic, accurate phase diagrams were obtained by spectroscopic measurements of polymer concentrations via fluorescent labeling of polycations. These phase diagrams unambiguously revealed that the liquidlike coacervation is more stable against salt addition at reduced local polarity over a wide range of molecular weights. These trends were quantitatively captured by a theory of  complexation that incorporates the effects of dispersion interactions, charge connectivity, and reversible ion-binding, providing the microscopic design rules for tuning molecular parameters and local polarity.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Junzhe Lou [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sean Friedowitz, Jian Qin, Yan Xia"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Tunable Coacervation, Homologous Polyanions", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Mar 2019"}
