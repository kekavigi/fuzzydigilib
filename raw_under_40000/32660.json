{"Nomor": 32660, "Judul": "Evaluation of Lubrication Properties of Refortified Hydraulic Oils", "Abstrak": "Used lubricating oil contains more than 90% of good base\noil and available additives, providing the potential of energy\nconservation, environmental protection, and economy, though\nit loses its useful performance because of contamination by impurities, oxidation, and degradation of additives. Many countries around the world have focused on reclamation and rerefining methods to treat and reuse waste lubricating oils for\nmany years. But the regeneration rate of waste oils is very low\nin China, less than 20% of the lubricant consumption. Few\nstudies on the performance, especially lubrication properties\nof recycled lubricating oils, have been considered. In this article, based on differences between used and fresh oils, used\noils were reclaimed and replenished with additives (henceforth\nrefortified oils). The physical and chemical properties, including viscosity, total acid number, moisture content, copper corrosion, and water separability from petroleum oil and synthetic fluid as well as the lubrication characteristics of three\nkinds of refortified hydraulic oils were investigated. The lubrication performance was evaluated using a four-ball tribotester\nand a Universal Micro-Tribotester (UMT) reciprocating tester.\nMoreover, the worn surfaces were analyzed using confocal\nscanning optical microscopy (CSOM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy\n(EDS), and Raman spectroscopy. The results showed that refortified oils provided good physical and chemical properties,\nclose to those of fresh oils, and produced better tribological\ncharacteristics than used and even fresh oils. There were compositional differences between the films of fresh, used, and refortified oils.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "JIANFANG LIU [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Kali Gu", "Ding Wang, And Yuan Zhao"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Lubricant Recycling; Hydraulic Fluid; Lubrication Performance; Lubricant Physical and Chemical Analysis", "Sumber": "Society of Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers ISSN: 1040-2004 print / 1547-397X online DOI: 10.1080/10402004.2013.868565", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Des 2018"}
