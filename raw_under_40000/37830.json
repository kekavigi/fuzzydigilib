{"Nomor": 37830, "Judul": "The art of the transpersonal:   Its psychology and coaching application", "Abstrak": "This  article  outlines  an  approach  to  transpersonal  enquiry  and  its  application  to  coaching.  It  evolves  from  a  personal  journey  (autoethnography)  from  the  study  of  fine  art  principles  towards  the  practice  of  transpersonal  coaching  and  the  actualisation  of  the  theories  and  principles  of  transpersonal  and  coaching  psychology  respectively.  The  flow  of  the  journey  travels  through  an  appreciation  of  the  creation  of art, how to understand art and what this may mean to the individual, the links to some psychological principles  and  the  formation  of  a  methodology  which  combines  the  learned  elements  for  the  practitioner/participant (coach/coachee) to understand the self in their present condition.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Nat Clegg  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ho Law"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "art; autoethnography; transpersonal; coaching psychology", "Sumber": "Transpersonal Psychology Review; Spring2017, Vol. 19 Issue 1, p24-44, 21p", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Apr 2019"}
