{"Nomor": 35083, "Judul": "EXPERIMENTAL REALIZATION OF A QUANTUM AUTOENCODER: THE COMPRESSIONOF QUTRITS VIA MACHINE LEARNING", "Abstrak": "With quantum resources a precious commodity, their efficient use is highly desirable. Quantum\nautoencoders have been proposed as a way to reduce quantum memory requirements. Generally, an\nautoencoder is a device that uses machine learning to compress inputs, that is, to represent the input data in a lower-dimensional space. Here, we experimentally realize a quantum autoencoder, which learns how to\ncompress quantum data using a classical optimization routine. We demonstrate that when the inherent\nstructure of the dataset allows lossless compression, our autoencoder reduces qutrits to qubits with low\nerror levels. We also show that the device is able to perform with minimal prior information about the\nquantum data or physical system and is robust to perturbations during its optimization routine.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ALEX PEPPER [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["NORA TISCHLER,", "AND GEOFF J.
