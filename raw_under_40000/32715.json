{"Nomor": 32715, "Judul": "A data locality based scheduler to enhance MapReduce performance in heterogeneous environments", "Abstrak": "MapReduce is an essential framework for distributed storage and parallel processing for large-scale dataintensive jobs proposed in recent times. Hadoop default scheduler assumes homogeneous environment.\nThis assumption of homogeneity does not work at all times in practice and limits the performance of\nMapReduce. Data locality is essentially moving computation closer (faster access) to the input data.\nFundamentally, MapReduce does not always look into the heterogeneity from a data locality perspective.\nImproving data locality for MapReduce framework is an important issue to improve the performance of\nlarge-scale Hadoop clusters.\nThis paper proposes a novel data locality based scheduler which allocates input data blocks to the\nnodes based on their processing capacity. Also schedules map andreduce tasks to the nodes based on their\ncomputing ability in the heterogeneous Hadoop cluster. We evaluate proposed scheduler using different\nworkloads from Hi-Bench benchmark suite. The experimental results prove that our proposed scheduler\nenhances the MapReduce performance in heterogeneous environments. Minimizes job execution time,\nand also improves data locality for different parameters as compared to the Hadoop default scheduler,\nMatchmaking scheduler and Delay scheduler respectively.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Nenavath Srinivas Naik  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Atul Negi., Tapas Bapu B.R., , R.
