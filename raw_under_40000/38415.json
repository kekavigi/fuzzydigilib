This is a very dynamic process where the development of specific strategies to influence  consumers  is  almost  impossible.  The  aim  of  this  research  report  is  to  demonstrate  through real  examples  of  Bulgarian  mobile  operators  the  types  of  consumers  and  to  find  the  objective  and subjective  reasons  that  influence  the  thinking  and  behavior  of  consumers.  The  following  tasks  were tackled in order to achieve this goal: \n- Presentation of some mobile operators which impact different target groups. \n- Survey  of  main  strategies  and  techniques  from  business  organizations  which  are  targeting  the different types of consumers. The methods used for achieving this goal and resolving the tasks are: analysis of consumers and their behavior, analysis of successful practices, and comprehensive approach. The results indicate the need for analysis of dependencies and actual interests and decision-making process of consumers.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "L .
