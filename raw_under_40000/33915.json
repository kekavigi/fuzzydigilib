{"Nomor": 33915, "Judul": "ASSESSING GERMAN PROFESSORS\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd VIEWS OF NATURE OF SCIENCE", "Abstrak": "University professors\u2019 views of nature of science play an important role when guiding undergraduate\nstudents into the culture of practicing physicists. While these topics have a long-standing tradition in\nU.S. curricula they are not part of German educational standards or curricula. Additionally professors\u2019\nviews\u2014in contrast to those of their students\u2014are relatively under-researched. In this contribution, we\nestablish the possibility of testing German physics professors\u2019 views in an economically administrable\nsurvey. We first ask for their views of the nature of science, and then about how important they see these\naspects for students and how intensive they address them in their own physics classes at the university.\nWe demonstrate that an established test instrument can be reliably used with this demographic. The results indicate that the professors tend to views of naive empiricism but besides that hold mostly adequate beliefs. Learning about the nature of science in university courses, in general, is considered of much importance, which is also reflected in the professors\u2019 reported teaching habits. However, there are aspects in this area which are considered more or less important by the professors.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "DAVID WOITKOWSKI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["NORA LEONIE WURMBACH"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH 15, 010108 (2019); Published by the American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Jan 2019"}
