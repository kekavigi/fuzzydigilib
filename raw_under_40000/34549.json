{"Nomor": 34549, "Judul": "Studies On Seepage Law Considering Stratigraphic Dips", "Abstrak": "Currently, water injection is widely used for oil field developments. For reservoirs with complex\ngeological structures, large stratigraphic dip angles, low porosities and extra-low permeabilities,\nthe effect of water injection is not satisfying. This paper establishes a modified radial flow formula\non the dip angle, and uses the plane radial seepage theory to get formation pressure distributions\nand a production formula in tilted strata. For injectors with their threshold pressures greater than\ntheir formation in-situ pressures, the effective radius for waterflooding is derived for a given injection pressure and then it is used to evaluate waterflooding effect and well pattern suitability, and\nguide the oilfield production. This method can also be applied to other waterflooding oilfields with\nsimilar geological conditions.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yang Zeng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiaodong Kang", "Xiaoqing Xie", "Engao Tang", "Chunyan Liu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Plane radial flow, Stratigraphic dip Flow rate, Effective radius, Threshold pressure", "Sumber": "Petroleum, Volume 3, Issue 4, Pages 470-475 (December 2017)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Feb 2019"}
