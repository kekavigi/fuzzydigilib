{"Nomor": 33998, "Judul": "MATTER-WAVE DIFFRACTION FROM A PERIODIC ARRAY OF HALF PLANES", "Abstrak": "We report on reflection and diffraction of beams of He and D2 from square-wave gratings of a 400-?m\nperiod and strip widths ranging from 10 to 200 ?m at grazing-incidence conditions. In each case we\nobserve fully resolved matter-wave diffraction patterns including the specular reflection and diffracted\nbeams up to the second diffraction order. With decreasing strip width, the observed diffraction efficiencies exhibit a transformation from the known regime of quantum reflection from the grating strips to the regime of edge diffraction from a half-plane array. The latter is described by a single-parameter model developed previously to describe phenomena as diverse as quantum billiards, scattering of radio waves in urban areas, and reflection of matter waves from microstructures. Our data provide experimental confirmation of the widespread model. Moreover, our results demonstrate that neither classical reflection nor quantum reflection are essential for reflective diffraction of matter waves from a structured solid, but it can result exclusively from half-plane edge diffraction.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "JU HYEON LEE [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["LEE YEONG KIM,", "YUN-TAE KIM,", "CHANG YOUNG LEE,", "WIELAND SCH\u00d6LLKOPF,", "AND BUM SUK ZHAO (???)"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 122, 040401 (2019); \u00a9 2019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Feb 2019"}
