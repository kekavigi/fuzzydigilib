{"Nomor": 34543, "Judul": "Metabolism of urban wastewater: Ecological network analysis for Guangdong Province, China", "Abstrak": "Wastewater discharge is a burden on environmentally sustainable development, especially in the waterdeficient area. Existing Studies on wastewater discharge is not comprehensive for lacking analysis of\nmutual flow and necessary components. In this study, a wastewater metabolism input-output model is\ndeveloped to achieve sustainable development through a novel perspective to depict the industrial\nwastewater flow among sectors. Since chemical oxygen demand and ammonia nitrogen are indicators for\nstudying the degree of wastewater pollution, this paper also considers their wastewater to make the\nresearch synthetic and systematic. A case study of Guangdong Province, China, is conducted to further\nillustrate the potential benefits of the model in investigation of the sectors interactions. The results show\nthat the wastewater discharge of Guangdong Province is considerable, with industrial wastewater,\nchemical oxygen demand wastewater and ammonia-nitrogen wastewater being 7.53 billion tons, 852\nthousand tons and 69 thousand tons respectively. Some typical sectors have been distinguished based on\necological network analysis and input-output analysis for mitigating wastewater discharge, such as\nelectronic equipment manufacture, chemical materials and paper manufacture, and tertiary industry. The\nimplementation of the \u201cReplace Subsidies with Rewards\u201d policy is conducive to the discharge reduction\nof the system", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Boyue Zheng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Guohe Huang.,Lirong Liu.,Mengyu Zhai .,Yuru Guan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Wastewater metabolism input-output model Industrial wastewater Chemical oxygen demand wastewater Ammonia nitrogen wastewater Policy recommendations Guangdong province China", "Sumber": "Journal of Cleaner Production 217 (2019) 510-519", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Feb 2019"}
