{"Nomor": 32580, "Judul": "Data analysis of battery storage systems", "Abstrak": "Battery energy storage systems can assist distribution network operators (DNOs) to face the challenges raised\nby the substantial increase in distributed renewable generation. A challenge is that these resources are intermittent and\noften \u2018invisible\u2018 to the DNO. If not monitored, the aggregate size of small embedded generation resources can cause\nthermal wearing of distribution assets and voltage excursions, especially in sunny/windy periods with insufficient local\ndemand. Several developers of energy storage solutions, with technologies such as lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, offer\ntheir products to address peak shaving, frequency and voltage control needs within the network. Once deployed within\nthe energy network batteries experience capacity degradation with usage, these companies will need to incorporate\nmethods from prognostics and health management (PHM) in order to better manage their products. The main\ndeliverable of this project is validation of data analysis, based on relevance vector machine, to predict the remaining\nuseful life of Li-ion batteries. The accuracy of the predictions for different batteries is all within 10 cycles (within 8.5%\nrelative error). These results confirm the importance of PHM methods within a distribution system operator model,\nwhere lifecycle management of critical sub-systems and systems will become increasingly important to network\noperators.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Merlinda Andoni [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Generalities", "Kata Kunci": "Network components", "Sumber": "CIRED, Open Access Proc.
