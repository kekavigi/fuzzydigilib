{"Nomor": 32633, "Judul": "Derivates of azaphilone Monascus pigments", "Abstrak": "Progress Research on Monascus pigments has been very rapidly, includes the discovery of new pigments and\nmethods used for the isolation and identification of new pigments. Currently, nearly fifty seven new pigments\nhave been found which are derivatives of the six main pigments that already exist. The process of discovery of\nnew pigments can not be separated from the process which are carried out during fermentation or during the\nisolation. This review includes data from all fifty new pigments following chemical structure data, chemical\nformula, the level of water solubility, the value of Log P, Monascus strain, substrates used in the fermentation\nprocess and methode to identification. Data collected from various studies that have been done before, and\nadded with some of the new data. The aim of this review is to give more comprehensive data about Monascus\npigments.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ANNA YULIANA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Marlia Singgih", "Elin Julianti", "Philippe J.
