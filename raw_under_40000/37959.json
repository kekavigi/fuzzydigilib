{"Nomor": 37959, "Judul": "Some Points of Contact between the Biblical Deborah  War Traditions and Some Greek Mythologies", "Abstrak": "This  paper  examines  three  features  common  to  the  biblical  narrative  of  Deborah  and  Cretan  \nmyths. In the biblical story two heroines, Deborah and Jael, bear names of fauna, bee and ibex \n(mountain goat), respectively. Deborah/bee\u2019s prophetic gift enables her to determine the auspicious  moment  for  a  victorious  battle.  Jael/female  ibex,  gives  milk  in  a  special  vessel  to  Sisera,  \nwho,  fleeing  for  his  life,  ironically  takes  refuge  in  the  tent  of  Jael,  who  kills  him.  In  ancient  \nGreece,  \u201cMelissa\u201d,  which  means  \u201cbee\u201d,  is  a  common  epithet  for  prophetesses,  especially  those  \nwho provide oracles to military commanders, as did the prophetess of Delphi. In Cretan versions, Melissa has a sister named Amaltheia, which means \u201cmountain goat\u201d. When a prominent fugitive, the deity Zeus, takes refuge in her cave, she likewise gives him milk in a special vessel. In both tales the word for the special vessel expresses plenty.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Daniel Vainstub [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Deborah, Jael, Melissa, Amaltheia, prophetess", "Sumber": "Vetus Testamentum 61 (2011) 324-334", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Apr 2019"}
