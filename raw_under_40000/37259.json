{"Nomor": 37259, "Judul": "Evaluation of a commercial Model Based Iterative reconstruction algorithm in computed tomography", "Abstrak": "Introduction: Iterative reconstruction algorithms have been introduced in clinical practice to obtain dose\nreduction without compromising the diagnostic performance.\nPurpose: To investigate the commercial Model Based IMR algorithm by means of patient dose and image\nquality, with standard Fourier and alternative metrics.\nMaterials and methods: A Catphan phantom, a commercial density phantom and a cylindrical water filled\nphantom were scanned both varying CTDIvol and reconstruction thickness. Images were then reconstructed\nwith Filtered Back Projection and both statistical (iDose) and Model Based (IMR) Iterative reconstruction\nalgorithms.\nSpatial resolution was evaluated with Modulation Transfer Function and Target Transfer Function.\nNoise reduction was investigated with Standard Deviation. Furthermore, its behaviour was analysed with\n3D and 2D Noise Power Spectrum. Blur and Low Contrast Detectability were investigated.\nPatient dose indexes were collected and analysed.\nResults: All results, related to image quality, have been compared to FBP standard reconstructions.\nModel Based IMR significantly improves Modulation Transfer Function with an increase between 12%\nand 64%. Target Transfer Function curves confirm this trend for high density objects, while Blur presents a\nsharpness reduction for low density details.\nModel Based IMR underlines a noise reduction between 44% and 66% and a variation in noise power\nspectrum behaviour. Low Contrast Detectability curves underline an averaged improvement of\n35\u201345%; these results are compatible with an achievable reduction of 50% of CTDIvol.\nA dose reduction between 25% and 35% is confirmed by median values of CTDIvol.\nConclusion: IMR produces an improvement in image quality and dose reduction.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Nicoletta Paruccini  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Raffaele Villa, Claudia Pasquali , Chiara Spadavecchia, Antonia Baglivi , Andrea Crespi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Computed tomography, Model Based Iterative reconstruction, algorithm", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Mar 2019"}
