{"Nomor": 35930, "Judul": "Qualitative analysis of MTEM response using instantaneous attributes", "Abstrak": "This paper introduces new technique for qualitative analysis of multi-transient electromagnetic (MTEM) earth\nimpulse response over complex geological structures. Instantaneous phase and frequency attributes were used\nin place of the conventional common offset section for improved qualitative interpretation of MTEM data by\nobtaining more detailed information from the earth impulse response. The instantaneous attributes were used\nto describe the lateral variation in subsurface resistivity and the visible geological structure with respect to\ngiven offsets. Instantaneous phase attribute was obtained by converting the impulse response into a complex\nform using the Hilbert transform. Conversely, the polynomial phase difference (PPD) estimator was favored\nover the center finite difference (CFD) approximation method in calculating the instantaneous frequency attribute\nbecause it is computationally efficient and has the ability to give a smooth variation of the instantaneous frequency\nover a common offset section. The observed results from the instantaneous attributes were in good\nagreement with both the subsurface model used and the apparent resistivity section obtained from the MTEM\nearth impulse response. Hence, this study confirms the capability of both instantaneous phase and frequency attributes\nas highly effective tools for MTEM qualitative analysis.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Olalekan Fayemi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Qingyun Di"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "MTEM Instantaneous attributes Polynomial phase difference Center finite difference FDTD", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 146 (2017) 37\u201345, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.07.014", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "05 Mar 2019"}
