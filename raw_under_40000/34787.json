{"Nomor": 34787, "Judul": "Gender bias in addictions and their treatment. An overview from  the social perspective", "Abstrak": "Gender  perspective  in  sociological  analysis  provides  large  doses  of  pragmatism  in  the  work  of  social  problems.  From  this premise, we have developed a piece of research based on the problem suggested by the organization \u201cProyecto Hombre Murcia, Solidaridad  y  Reinserci\u00f3n\u201d,  the  main  objective  of  which  was  to  analyze  the  existing  differences  in  problems  among  men  and \nwomen in treatment, and the implications these have on the success of the treatment. Thus, we have performed an analysis of social  perceptions  of  addicts  receiving  treatment.  The  methodology  used  was  qualitative,  allowing  for  the  participation  of people undergoing treatment in the focus groups, together with interviews developed for this research. This has helped explain \nand understand why gender roles are affecting welfare policies and intervention programs. \n\u00a9 2014 The Authors.
