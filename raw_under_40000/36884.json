{"Nomor": 36884, "Judul": "Mixing of Shiga toxin-producing and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli in a wastewater treatment plant receiving city and slaughterhouse wastewater", "Abstrak": "Wastewater of human and animal may contain Shiga toxin-producing (STEC) and enteropathogenic (EPEC)\nEscherichia coli. We evaluated the prevalence of such strains in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) receiving\nboth city and slaughterhouse wastewater. PCR screenings were performed on 12,248 E. coli isolates. The prevalence\nof STEC in city wastewater, slaughterhouse wastewater and treated effluent was 0.22%, 0.07% and\n0.22%, respectively. The prevalence of EPEC at the same sampling sites was 0.63%, 0.90% and 0.55%. No\nsignificant difference was observed between the sampling points. Treatment had no impact on these prevalences.\nEnterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O157:H7 and O111:H8 were isolated from the treated effluent rejected into\nthe river. The characteristics of STEC and EPEC differed according to their origin. City wastewater contained\nSTEC with various stx subtypes associated with serious human disease, whereas slaughterhouse wastewater\ncontained exclusively STEC with stx2e subtype. All the EPEC strains were classified as atypical and were screened\nfor the ?, ?1 and ?1 subtypes, known to be associated with the EHEC mainly involved in human infections in\nFrance. In city wastewater, eae subtypes remained largely unidentified; whereas eae-?1 was the most frequent\nsubtype in slaughterhouse wastewater. Moreover, the EPEC isolated from slaughterhouse wastewater were\npositive for other EHEC-associated virulence markers, including top five serotypes, the ehxA gene, putative\nadherence genes and OI-122 associated genes. The possibility that city wastewater could contain a pool of stx\ngenes associated with human disease and that slaughterhouse wastewater could contain a pool of EPEC sharing\nsimilar virulence genes with EHEC, was highlighted. Mixing of such strains in WWTP could lead to the emergence\nof EHEC by horizontal gene transfer", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Delphine Bibbal [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Maryse Mich\u00e8le Um.,Alpha Amadou Diallo.,Monique K\u00e9rour\u00e9dan.,V\u00e9ronique Dupouy.,Pierre-Louis Toutain.,Alain Bousquet-M\u00e9lou.,Eric Oswald.,Hubert Brug\u00e8re"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Escherichia coli Wastewater STEC EPEC", "Sumber": "International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health 221 (2018) 355\u2013363", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Mar 2019"}
