{"Nomor": 33101, "Judul": "NIR-Responsive Copolymer Upconversion Nanocomposites for Triggered Drug Release in Vitro and in Vivo", "Abstrak": "Light has several advantages as the stimulus for\na triggered drug release. Currently, the applications of\nphototriggered drug-release\ndevices (PDDs) are largely\nlimited by two factors: the limited tissue penetration and\ndetrimental e\nff\nects caused by excitation light (ultraviolet or\nvisible light). To address thi\ns disadvantage, this study\ndeveloped nanocomposites based on upconversion nano-\nparticles (UC), which could convert near-infrared light to\nultraviolet\n?\nvisible light and trigger drug release. By loading\nUC and doxorubicin (DOX) into photoresponsive copolymer\nPEG-NMAB-PLA (PNP), near-infrared responsive copolymer\nupconversion nanocomposites (PNP-DOX-UC) were constructed. We proved that PNP-DOX-UC showed the fast release and\nstrong cytotoxicity under near-infrared irradiation in vitro. The therapeutic e\nffi\ncacy study indicated that PNP-DOX-UC+\nhv\nhad\nthe enhanced antitumor e\nffi\nciency. In the study, UC becoming an internal ultraviolet\n?\nvisible light source for near-infrared\nexcitation develops an applicable and e\nffi\ncient approach to meet the requirements for UV/vis excitation, which is a major\ndisadvantage in photosensitive materials developed for pharmaceutical and biomedical applications.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yeye Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Guangzhao Lu", "Yuan Yu", "He Zhang,", "Jie Gao", "Zhiguo Sun", "Ying Lu", "Hao Zou"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "near-infrared light, photoresponsive, copolymer, upconversion nanoparticle, nanocomposites, triggered drug release", "Sumber": "Cite This: ACS Appl.
