{"Nomor": 34852, "Judul": "Decline Curve Based Models For Predicting Natural Gas Well Performance", "Abstrak": "The productivity of a gas well declines over its production life as cannot cover economic policies. To\novercome such problems, the production performance of gas wells should be predicted by applying\nreliable methods to analyse the decline trend. Therefore, reliable models are developed in this\nstudy on the basis of powerful artificial intelligence techniques viz. the artificial neural network\n(ANN) modelling strategy, least square support vector machine (LSSVM) approach, adaptive neurofuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and decision tree (DT) method for the prediction of cumulative gas\nproduction as well as initial decline rate multiplied by time as a function of the Arps' decline curve\nexponent and ratio of initial gas flow rate over total gas flow rate. It was concluded that the results\nobtained based on the models developed in current study are in satisfactory agreement with the\nactual gas well production data. Furthermore, the results of comparative study performed demonstrates that the LSSVM strategy is superior to the other models investigated for the prediction of\nboth cumulative gas production, and initial decline rate multiplied by time.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Arash Kamari [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Amir H.
