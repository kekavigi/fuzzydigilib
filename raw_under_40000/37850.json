{"Nomor": 37850, "Judul": "The Poetic Mission  Art II: Reviewing a Life, a Calling", "Abstrak": "Among these senior words, this questioning and quieting narrative, art, and all its imperfections, \ncontributed  wonderfully  to  the  defining  history  of  my  life.  As  a  doer  in  this  world,  as  a  \ncommitted   poet,   political   and   cultural   activist,   educator,   publisher,   public   intellectual,   \nbusinessman,   husband,   father,   cultural   father,   word-organizer,   editor,   institution   builder,   \nprotector  of  children  and  pro-street-fighter,  I  have  swum  in  an  ocean  not  of  my  making.  After  \nover  sixty-seven  years  of  an  imperfected  back stroke,  I  realize  the  many  countless  times  I  have  been close to drowning, only to emerge stronger in part due to the thousands of special and not \nso special people I have encountered in this life, in this struggle.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Haki R.
