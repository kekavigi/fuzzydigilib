{"Nomor": 32785, "Judul": "STING Signaling in Cancer Cells: Important or Not?", "Abstrak": "Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an\nadaptor protein that plays an important role in the activation\nof type I interferons in response to cytosolic nucleic\nacid ligands. Recent evidence indicates involvement of the\nSTING pathway in the induction of antitumor immune\nresponse. Therefore, STING agonists are now being\nextensively developed as a new class of cancer therapeutics.\nHowever, little is known about the consequences of\nactivated STING-mediated signaling in cancer cells on the\nefficacy of the antitumor treatment. It has been shown that\nactivation of the STING-dependent pathway in cancer cells\ncan result in tumor infiltration with immune cells and\nmodulation of the anticancer immune response. Understanding\nthe function of STING pathway in cancer cells\nmight provide important insights into the development of\neffective therapeutic strategies. This review focuses on the\nrole of STING pathway in cancer cells, the largely\nunknown topic that has recently emerged to be important in\nthe context of STING-mediated antitumor responses.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Olga Sokolowska [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dominika Nowis"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "STING, Type I interferons, Innate immunity, Cancer immunology, Cyclic dinucleotides", "Sumber": "Springer", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "03 Jan 2019"}
