However, deterministic measure and control of strain fields\nin these systems are challenging because of the atomic thinness and unconventional interface behaviors of\n2D materials. Here, we experimentally characterize a simple and unified power law for the profiles of a\nvariety of nanobubbles and nanotents formed by 2D materials such as graphene and MoS2 layers. Using\nmembrane theory, we analytically unveil what sets the in-plane strains of these blisters regarding their\nshape and interface characteristics. Our analytical solutions are validated by Raman spectroscopy measured\nstrain distributions in bulged graphene bubbles supported by strong and weak shear interfaces.We advocate\nthat both the strain magnitudes and distributions can be tuned by 2D material-substrate interface adhesion\nand friction properties.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ZHAOHE DAI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["YUAN HOU,", "DANIEL A.
