{"Nomor": 35956, "Judul": "Water saturation effects on dynamic fracture behavior of sandstone", "Abstrak": "To understand combined effects of water saturation and loading rate on the fracture behavior of rock materials,\ndynamic notched semi-circular bending (NSCB) tests were conducted on dry and saturated sandstone specimens\nunder a wide range of loading rates using a modified split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) setup. Test results\nrevealed that, the dynamic fracture initiation, propagation toughness and crack propagation velocity of saturated specimen were apparently lower than that of dry ones at the same loading rate. The above parameters\nincreased with the increase of loading rate. Compared with the dry specimen, the saturated specimen owned a\nhigher rate dependency of the dynamic fracture initiation, propagation toughness and a lower rate dependency\nof crack propagation velocity. Moreover, dual effects of water on the fracture behavior under different loading\nrates were discussed. It is believed that the different rate dependencies of fracture behaviors between dry and\nsaturated specimens was governed by the combined weakening and enhancing effects of water. A micro-mechanical model was further developed to explain the experimental results based on the duality of water and\nlinear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM).", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zilong Zhou [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xin Cai , Dan Ma , Xueming Du, Lu Chen, Haiquan Wang , Haizhi Zang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Sandstone, Water saturation, Dynamic fracture toughness, Crack propagation velocity, SHPB, Rate dependency", "Sumber": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrmms.2018.12.014", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "05 Mar 2019"}
