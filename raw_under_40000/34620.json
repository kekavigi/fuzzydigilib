{"Nomor": 34620, "Judul": "Assessment of groundwater prospect and aquifer protective capacity using resistivity method in Olabisi Onabanjo University campus, Ago-Iwoye, Southwestern Nigeria", "Abstrak": "Electrical resistivity investigation was carried out at Olabisi Onabanjo University campus, Ago-Iwoye,\nSouthwestern Nigeria with the aim of evaluating groundwater potential and aquifer protective capacity of the\noverburden units in the area. The underlain rocks are predominantly porphyroblastic and banded gneiss, quartzschist\nand biotite-hornblende granite.\nTwenty-Four Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES) were probed using Schlumberger array with maximum\ncurrent electrode spacing (AB/2) of 100m at each point using the OHMEGA Allied resistivity meter. The data\nwere interpreted using the partial curve matching and computer iteration programme using WINRESIST.\nParameters such as overburden thickness, basement resistivity, reflection coefficient and longitudinal conductance\nwere calculated and used for evaluating the groundwater potential and aquifer vulnerability of the\nstudy area.\nThe predominant VES curve types obtained are KH, H, A, AKH, HKH and HA. The geoelectric sections show\nthat the area is underlain by 3\u20135 layers: the topsoil (72.4\u20131735.6 ? m), clay/clayey sand/sand/laterite\n(18.9\u20131349.5 ? m), fractured basement (430.7\u20131021.4 ? m) and the fresh basement (433.3\u20137146.4 ? m). The\nplotted isopach map showed an overburden thickness range of 4.9\u201328.2m with values greater than 20m at the\nsouth-eastern and south-western parts of area. The reflection coefficient range is between 0.62 and 0.98 while\nprotective capacity range is between 0.03 and 0.28. Groundwater potential of the area were classified as high\n(overburden thickness > 13m and reflection coefficient < 0.8); medium (overburden thickness > 13m and\nreflection coefficient?0.8); and low (overburden thickness < 13m and reflection coefficient > 0.8). The\nprotective capacity rating falls between poor to moderate, thus, vulnerable to infiltration of leachate and other\nsurface contaminants.\nThe study therefore helped in identifying favourable groundwater potential and the aquifer vulnerability of\nthe area.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Olateju O.
