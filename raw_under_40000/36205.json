{"Nomor": 36205, "Judul": "Prediction Of Asphaltene Precipitation Using Support Vector Regression Tuned With Genetic Algorithms", "Abstrak": "Due to the severe and costly problems caused by asphaltene precipitation in petroleum industry,\ndeveloping a quick and accurate model, to predict the asphaltene precipitation under different\nconditions, seems crucial. In this study, a new model, namely genetic algorithm e support vector\nregression (GA-SVR) is proposed, which is applied to predict the amount of asphaltene precipitation. GA is used to select the best optimal values of SVR parameters and kernel parameter,\nsimultaneously, to increase the generalization performance of the SVR. The GA-SVR model is\ntrained and tested on the experimental data sets reported in literature. The performance of the GASVR model is compared with two scaling equation models, using statistical error measures and\ngraphical analyses. The results show that the prediction performance of the proposed model, is\nhighly reliable and satisfactory.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mohammad Ghorbani  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ghasem Zargar", "Hooshang Jazayeri-Rad"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Asphaltene precipitation, Prediction Support Vector Regression (SVR), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Parameter optimization", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 3, Pages 301-306 (September  2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Mar 2019"}
