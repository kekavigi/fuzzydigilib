The common elements and principles in painting and  architecture  will  be  held  in  details  with  examples,  to  put forward  the  importance  of  relationship  between  two  fields,  in  the aim of proposing a new teaching/learning strategy for basic design education. In the light of this aim, mainly the \u201cspace\u201d concept, which is the most common element for an artistic and architectural work will be exemplified with the course practices produced at Karadeniz Technical University, Department of Architecture, Trabzon, Turkey.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ASU BESGEN [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Education; Painting; Architecture; Basic Design; Space.", "Sumber": "Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 182 ( 2015 ) 420 \u2013 427", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos \u00a0\n                                     Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Feb 2019"}
