The bowtie antennas were designed on FR4_epoxy substrate of thickness 1.6 mm by using 3D-HFSS software which uses the Finite Element Method (FEM) .The measurement results obtained by using the VNA were compared with the simulation results. All the three bowtie antennas designs have a minimum return loss, RL?-10dB and VSWR ? 2.The bowtie antennas were designed to operate in the frequency range of 300 MHz - 3 GHz in order to capture the UHF PD signal emitted from the PD source in the form of induced EM waves. The PD measurement results have shown that the two designs of the double layer bowtie antenna with wing edge modification, namely Antenna no.1 and Antenna no.2 have higher sensitivity in detecting PD signal compared to single layer bowtie antenna (Antenna no.3). This is due to the fact that the antenna no.1 and antenna no.2 have a wider bandwidth value compared to antenna no.3 because antenna no.1 has a bandwidth of 560MHz while antenna no.2 has a total bandwidth of 602MHz and antenna no.3 has a bandwidth of 216MHz based on the simulation results. The PD measurement was carried out at three applied voltage levels ,namely, 5 kV, 6 kV and 7kV. The PD measurement results have shown that the higher applied voltage, the high Vpp magnitude for PD waveform, PD charge magnitude and PD number in both negative and positive half cycle.", "Daftar File": {"Abstrak": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/172230"}, "Penulis": "Jean Pierre Uwiringiyimana [23217701]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Umar Khayam, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Elektro", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Teknik Elektro dan Informatika", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Partial discharge,UHF, bowtie antenna, return loss, bandwidth,VSWR.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "karya", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Jun 2019"}
