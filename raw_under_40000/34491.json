{"Nomor": 34491, "Judul": "Optical constants of oilfield wastewater", "Abstrak": "The optical properties of oilfield wastewater play an important role in the study of oilfield\nwastewater. Optical constants are the important parameters of optical properties, which\nare usually obtained by measuring transmittance spectra. Transmittance spectra of oilfield\nwastewater in the wavelength range of 190\u2013900 nm at normal incidence were measured\nby a TU-1900 double beam ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer. The optical constants of\noilfield wastewater were calculated by the double thickness method. The results show that\nthe optical constants of oilfield wastewater with different oil content are different. The\nrefractive index of oilfield wastewater increases with oil content increasing, and the values\nof them are in the range of 1.06\u20131.17. The absorption index of oilfield wastewater increases\nwith the increase of oil content, and the values of them are in the range of 2.70 \u00d7 10?7-\n7.60 \u00d7 10?7.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Da Zhao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Lu Yang.,Xinyan Zhang.,Dong Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Oilfield wastewater Transmittance spectra Optical constants", "Sumber": "Optik 167 (2018) 37\u201341", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Feb 2019"}
