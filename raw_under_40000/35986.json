{"Nomor": 35986, "Judul": "On Chesil Beach  and Fordian Technique: Intertextuality, Intimacy, Ethical Reading", "Abstrak": "Ian  McEwan\u2019s  use  of  Fordian  elements  and  techniques  in  his  novella  On  Chesil  Beach\nspecifically  allusions  to The  Good  Soldier;  impressionism  as  an  epistemological and narrative strategy; and elements of narrative discourse such as perspective, time, and order direct our attention to the narrativization of intimacy, what is say able and unsayable in the representation of intimacy, and to what kinds of knowledge narrative provides access. These moves teach us a form of ethical reading generated by the thinking of Emmanuel Levinas: how to navigate McEwan\u2019s representation of desire, \nintimacy, and alterity in order to recognize the epistemological and ethical commitments and problems engendered by narrative", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Janine Utell [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Ian McEwan, Ford Madox Ford, Emmanuel Levinas, impressionism , ethical reading", "Sumber": "Journal of Modern Literature.
