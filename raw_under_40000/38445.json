{"Nomor": 38445, "Judul": "Nano-Sized Structurally Disordered Metal Oxide Composite Aerogels as High-Power Anodes in Hybrid Supercapacitors", "Abstrak": "A general method for preparing nano-sized metal\noxide nanoparticles with highly disordered crystal structure and\ntheir processing into stable aqueous dispersions is presented. With\nthese nanoparticles as building blocks, a series of nanoparticles@\nreduced graphene oxide (rGO) composite aerogels are fabricated\nand directly used as high-power anodes for lithium-ion hybrid\nsupercapacitors (Li-HSCs). To clarify the effect of the degree of\ndisorder, control samples of crystalline nanoparticles with similar\nparticle size are prepared. The results indicate that the structurally\ndisordered samples show a significantly enhanced electrochemical\nperformance compared to the crystalline counterparts. In\nparticular, structurally disordered NixFeyOz@rGO delivers a capacity of 388 mAh g?1 at 5 A g?1\n, which is 6 times that\nof the crystalline sample. Disordered NixFeyOz@rGO is taken as an example to study the reasons for the enhanced\nperformance. Compared with the crystalline sample, density functional theory calculations reveal a smaller volume\nexpansion during Li+ insertion for the structurally disordered NixFeyOz nanoparticles, and they are found to exhibit larger\npseudocapacitive effects. Combined with an activated carbon (AC) cathode, full-cell tests of the lithium-ion hybrid\nsupercapacitors are performed, demonstrating that the structurally disordered metal oxide nanoparticles@rGO||AC hybrid\nsystems deliver high energy and power densities within the voltage range of 1.0?4.0 V. These results indicate that\nstructurally disordered nanomaterials might be interesting candidates for exploring high-power anodes for Li-HSCs.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJNRL PP Haijian Huang 1.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/169722"}, "Penulis": "Haijian Huang, [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xing Wang, Elena Tervoort, Guobo Zeng,Tian Liu,Xi Chen, Alla Sologubenko,Markus Niederberger"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "metal oxides, crystallinity, power density, energy density, pseudocapacitance, aerogel, hybrid supercapacitors", "Sumber": "Cite This: ACS Nano 2018, 12, 2753?2763", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Mei 2019"}
