{"Nomor": 35622, "Judul": "In-Depth Study On The Solubility Of Elemental Sulfur In Sour Gas Mixtures Based On The Chrastil's Association Model", "Abstrak": "Accurately predicting the solubility of elemental sulfur in sour gas mixtures is a primary task. As a\ncurrent and widely-used model on the solubility of elemental sulfur in sour gas mixtures, Chrastil's\nassociation model has a big error in the process of predicting experimental data based on different\nfitting methods. This paper combined with experimental data reported by relevant scholars about\nelemental sulfur solubility in sour gases and selected density, temperature and pressure as three\nimportant influential factors. According to different fitting methods, we can calculate the correlation parameters in Chrastil's model. Then different solubility formulas can be used to predict the\nsolubility of elemental sulfur in sour gas mixtures. Through in-depth research and analysis of\nChrastil's solubility model from numerical aspects, it's easy to find the irrationality about Chrastil's\nsolubility model and fitting methods. Especially in fitting methods, further improvement of the\nfitting method is proposed and used to predict the solubility of elemental sulfur in sour gas mixtures. The calculation results show that some improvements of the predicting precision have been\nachieved by using the improved fitting method in Chrastil's association model", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Qiao Wang  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiao Guo", "Runxi Leng"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Solubility, Numerical analysis, Elemental sulfur, Prediction model, Sour gas, Chrastil's association model", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 4, Pages 425-434 (December 2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Feb 2019"}
