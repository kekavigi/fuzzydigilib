{"Nomor": 38284, "Judul": "DESIGN  PRINCIPLES FOR  VIRTUAL  WORLDS", "Abstrak": "In this research note, we examine the design, development, validation, and use of virtual worlds. Our purpose in doing so is to extend the design science paradigm by developing a set of design principles applicable to the context of virtual environments, particularly those using agent-based simulation as their underlying technology. Our central argument is that virtual worlds comprise a new class of information system, one that combines the structural aspects of traditional modeling and simulation \nsystems in concert with emergent user dynamics of systems supporting emergent knowledge processes.  Our approach involves two components.  First, we review the characteristics of agent-based virtual worlds (ABVWs) to discern design requirements that may challenge current design theory.  From this review, we derive a  set of design principles based on deep versus emergent\nstructures  where  deep  structures  reflect  conventional  modeling  and  simulation  system  architectures  and emergent structures capture the unpredictable user\u2013system dynamics inherent in emergent knowledge processes,  which  increasingly  characterize  virtual  worlds.    We  illustrate  how  these  design  challenges  are addressed with an exemplar of a complex mirror world, a large-scale ABVW we developed called Sentient World.  Our contribution is the insight of partitioning \nABVW architectures into deep and emergent structures that  mirror  modeling  systems  and  emergent  knowledge  processes  respectively,  while  developing  extended design principles to facilitate their integration.  We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our design\nprinciples for informing and guiding future research and practice.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Alok R.
