{"Nomor": 34216, "Judul": "The Current State of Arts Education in Iran: A Case Study in Two Elementary Schools Using Educational Criticism", "Abstrak": "The central aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the recently revised elementary curricu-\nlum for arts education in Iran. The study employed an educational criticism method and was conducted\nin two elementary schools. Data were collected by observation, semi-structured interviews and curricu-\nlum documents over a four-month period. The research participants consisted of 12 professionals (teach-\ners, coordinators and principals), and 30 students (8\n\u2013\n12 year-olds from different cultural backgrounds).\nAccording to the results of this study, the schools\n\u2019\narchitecture and environment do not promote cre-\nativity, active participation and engagement in the learning process. The general and speci\nfi\nc objectives,\nthe content areas, the time allocated to the teaching of each area, teaching methods and assessment\nprocedures have been clearly de\nfi\nned in the of\nfi\ncial curriculum documents for arts education. Neverthe-\nless, the areas of painting and occasionally handcrafts are the content areas which are taught to stu-\ndents using direct methods of teaching and students\n\u2019\nperformance is often evaluated by traditional\ntests. The study concludes that the current arts curriculum has not been successful, or not as successful\nas it was intended to be. The most common obstacle to effective arts teaching, however, is the lack of\na place for arts within the school programme similar to that of science and mathematics. Lack of\nenough well-trained teachers with an educational background in arts education is another obstacle that\nneeds to be addressed in future revisions of the curriculum.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ali Nouri [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Soheila Farsi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "arts education, educational criticism, school curriculum, elementary schools", "Sumber": "THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION, 201", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Feb 2019"}
