{"Nomor": 38472, "Judul": "Tomographic full waveform inversion using normalized integral wavefield", "Abstrak": "Thanks to smooth intrinsic nature of normalized integral wavefield (NIW), full waveform inversion (FWI) using\nNIWhas a potential to retrieve the long wavelength model parameters from seismic data even in the absence of\nlow frequencies. However, if reflection events are dominant in the data, this strategy might fail in rendering a\nconvergent result. To steer the focus of inversion more onto the matching of first arrivals' kinematics, hence\nthe tomographic result, we construct objective functions using the logarithmic NIW and the NIW raised to the\npower of small positive number for FWI. We derive the gradient formulae of the new objective functions using\nthe adjoint-state method, thus the computational cost of our approaches remains compatible to that of the\nconventional FWI. Synthetic data example on 2D SEG/EAGE salt-dome model, inwhich reflections are prevalent,\nindicates that our FWI approaches generate tomographic convergent results even without low frequency\ninformation.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yunseok Choi  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mahesh Kalita"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Full waveform inversion Normalized integral wavefield Tomographic inversion First arrival kinematics Adjoint-state method", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 165 (2019) 29\u201336, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2019.04.007", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Mei 2019"}
