This research investigates the possibilities of retrofitting the effluent treatment plant\n(ETP) of a distillery with microalgae treatment step. For this, at first the photobioreactors of capacity 50 L and\n500 L were customized for the cultivation of Spirulina sp. under xenon lamp and sunlight. The reactor supported\nthe maximum specific growth rate up to 0.42 \u00b1 0.03 d?1 in the 50 L reactor at laboratory and 0.10 \u00b1 0.02 d?1\nin the 500 L reactor at the outdoor for Spirulina sp. The treatability of wastewater of COD\n30,000 ppm\u201340,000 ppm was carried out in those reactors with the Spirulina sp. of culture volume fraction 0.8\nand 0.93 under xenon lamp and sunlight respectively. The chemical oxygen demand and total dissolved solids\nreduction were 60\u201370% in both the volume fractions of the culture. Ion chromatography analysis indicated the\nreduction of major inorganic pollutants in the wastewater by the Spirulina sp. The algae were sustainable when\nthe culture volume fraction was increased from 0.8 to 0.93. Thus, the phycoremediation was shown the significant pollution reduction in the wastewater. The addition of this step is valuable and it benefits the distillery\nby not only improving the quality of wastewater but also through the generation of algae biomass that would be\nappropriate for animal feed or biofuel application. However, the detail biochemical study is needed for the best\nuse of algae biomass and the treatment could be checked for the long run sustainability.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Sankaran Krishnamoorthy [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Premalatha Manickam.,Vijayasekaran Muthukaruppan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Spirulina sp.
