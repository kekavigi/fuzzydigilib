{"Nomor": 34252, "Judul": "A Review On Casing While Drilling Technology For Oil And Gas Production With Well Control Model And Economical Analysis", "Abstrak": "The extraction of petroleum fluids from sub-surface accumulations mandates the drilling of a well into the\nformation containing the accumulation. The drilling techniques have evolved over time to overcome several\nchallenges while some of the issues still prevail with the currently used drilling practices like loss circulation,\nlarge tripping time to change bottom hole assembly, stuck pipe problems and low well bore stability, to name a\nfew. These decrease the drilling efficiency and increase the Non-Productive Time (NPT) of this highly capitalintensive industry encouraging the Petroleum Industry to look for new technology. Casing while Drilling (CwD)\nis a technique of drilling which has been proven to alleviate many of the problems faced while drilling. In this\nmethod, drilling and casing of a well bore is carried out simultaneously, which improves the drilling efficiency\nby reducing the NPT. It has proven to be beneficial in controlling loss circulation and improving wellbore\nstability by \u2018Plastering\u2019 effect, high quality cement job and increased rig floor safety. It uses smaller rig and less\nfuel thereby reducing carbon footprint in the environment. This paper studies comprehensive well control and\ncasing string design consideration. Economics encourages its application that has been discussed in the paper. A\ncase study on the application of CwD in Malay basin for top hole drilling is presented. Finally, the paper briefly\noutlines the technical challenges that need attention to get better results from CwD.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "DIPAL PATEL [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Vivek Thakar", "Sivakumar Pandian", "Manan Shah", "Anirbid Sircar"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Casing while drilling, Non productive time, Plastering effect, Well control", "Sumber": "Petroleum , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.12.003", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Feb 2019"}
