{"Nomor": 38430, "Judul": "The Evolution of Management Information Systems:  A Literature Review", "Abstrak": "The  Management  Information  Systems  (MISs)  have  been  displaying  considerable  diversity  during  the evolution  in  the  past  decades.  It  comes  such  a  big  demand  and  challenge  to  draw  an  overarching  picture  of  the evolutionary development of MISs. By systematical\nly investigating the existing representative literature/research in MISs, especially by analyzing and modeling the MIS concepts, this paper first identifies the crises and challenges the traditional MIS has faced. Furthermore, by applying EBD, a design methodology, the author analyzes how these crises \nhave been addressed, and as a result, how the classical MIS Pyramid is transformed and developed into an intelligence-integration framework for the understanding of MISs evolution, which is able to not only position various information systems,  but  also  show  how  these  systems  are  still interrelated  in  the  whole  process  of  the  evolution.  The  two dimensional  framework  here  for  MISs  is conceptual  model  based,  and  different  from  prior  frameworks,  is  able  to describe the overall evolution of  management information systems dynamically, rather than just  \u201cpartially\u201d, or \n\u201cstatically\u201d.  This  framework  also  provides  a  model  applicable  to  the  development  of  MISs  and  information technologies, thus it is has meanings not just academia but also practice. The descriptive validity or consolidation of the framework is demonstrated by applying it to published MISs\u2019 studies. Future trends and challenges of MISs are also discussed based on the framework in this paper.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xiaojuan (Julia) Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Management information systems, evolution, framework, Environment Based Design, literature review", "Sumber": "Transactions of the SDPS: Journal of Integrated Design and Process Science 17 ( 2 ) , 2013, 5 9 - 8 8", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Mei 2019"}
