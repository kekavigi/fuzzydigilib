{"Nomor": 35820, "Judul": "Robust noise attenuation based on nuclear norm minimization and a trace prediction strategy", "Abstrak": "Rejecting noise in seismic data while not affecting the amplitude of useful signals is a long standing problem\nin seismic data processing. Seismic noise attenuation can be formulated as a nuclear norm minimization (NNM) problem. To meet the assumption that seismic data should have low nuclear norm, we first\nmap the seismic data into a low-rank matrix based on a trace prediction strategy. We provide detailed\nalgorithm workflow and mathematical analysis of the trace prediction method. The seismic data after trace\nrearrangement is demonstrated to be locally low-rank. The NNM problem is then solved via the singular value thresholding (SVT) algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated via both\nsynthetic and field data examples. We also test the robustness of the proposed method with respect to random noise, spiky noise, and blending interference. Compared with the state-of-the-art predictive filtering\nmethod, median filtering method, singular spectrum analysis method, and curvelet thresholding method,\nthe proposed method obtains an obviously better performance in compromising signal preservation and\nnoise removal.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yatong Zhou [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Shili Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Seismic noise attenuation Nuclear norm minimization Singular value thresholding Trace prediction Low-rank space", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 147 (2017) 52\u201367, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.09.005", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Mar 2019"}
