{"Nomor": 35650, "Judul": "Evaluation of optimal reservoir prospectivity using acoustic-impedance model inversion: A case study of an offshore field, western Niger Delta, Nigeria", "Abstrak": "The evaluation of economic potential of any hydrocarbon field involves the understanding of the reservoir\nlithofacies and porosity variations. This in turns contributes immensely towards subsequent reservoir\nmanagement and field development. In this study, integrated 3D seismic data and well log data\nwere employed to assess the quality and prospectivity of the delineated reservoirs (H1\u2013H5) within the\nOPO field, western Niger Delta using a model-based seismic inversion technique. The model inversion\nresults revealed four distinct sedimentary packages based on the subsurface acoustic impedance properties\nand shale contents. Low acoustic impedance model values were associated with the delineated\nhydrocarbon bearing units, denoting their high porosity and good quality. Application of model-based\ninverted velocity, density and acoustic impedance properties on the generated time slices of reservoirs\nalso revealed a regional fault and prospects within the field", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Kehinde D.
