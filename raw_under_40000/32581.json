{"Nomor": 32581, "Judul": "FINITE DISSIPATION IN ANISOTROPIC MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC TURBULENCE", "Abstrak": "In the presence of an externally supported, mean magnetic field, a turbulent, conducting medium, such as  \nplasma, becomes anisotropic. This mean magnetic field, which is separate from the fluctuating, turbulent\npart of the magnetic field, has considerable effects on the dynamics of the system. In this paper, we examine\nthe dissipation rates for decaying incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence with an\nincreasing Reynolds number and in the presence of a mean magnetic field of varying strength. Proceeding\nnumerically, we find that, as the Reynolds number increases, the dissipation rate asymptotes to a finite\nvalue for each magnetic-field strength, confirming the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n-Howarth hypothesis as applied to MHD.\nThe asymptotic value of the dimensionless dissipation rate is initially suppressed from the zero-mean-field\nvalue by the mean magnetic field but then approaches a constant value for higher values of the mean-field\nstrength. Additionally, for comparison, we perform a set of two-dimensional (2DMHD) and a set of\nreduced MHD (RMHD) simulations. We find that the RMHD results lie very close to the values\ncorresponding to the high-mean-field limit of the three-dimensional runs while the 2DMHD results admit\ndistinct values far from both the zero-mean-field cases and the high-mean-field limit of the threedimensional\ncases. These findings provide firm underpinnings for numerous applications in space and\nastrophysics wherein von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n decay of turbulence is assumed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "RIDDHI BANDYOPADHYAY [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["S.
