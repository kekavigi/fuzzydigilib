{"Nomor": 32588, "Judul": "ASYMMETRIC PARTICLE TRANSPORT AND LIGHT-CONE DYNAMICS INDUCED BY ANYONIC STATISTICS", "Abstrak": "We study the nonequilibrium dynamics of Abelian anyons in a one-dimensional system.We find that the\ninterplay of anyonic statistics and interactions gives rise to spatially asymmetric particle transport together\nwith a novel dynamical symmetry that depends on the anyonic statistical angle and the sign of interactions.\nMoreover, we show that anyonic statistics induces asymmetric spreading of quantum information,\ncharacterized by asymmetric light cones of out-of-time-ordered correlators. Such asymmetric dynamics is\nin sharp contrast to the dynamics of conventional fermions or bosons, where both the transport and\ninformation dynamics are spatially symmetric. We further discuss experiments with cold atoms where the\npredicted phenomena can be observed using state-of-the-art technologies. Our results pave the way toward\nexperimentally probing anyonic statistics through nonequilibrium dynamics.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "FANGLI LIU [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["JAMES R.
