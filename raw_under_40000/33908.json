Laboratory true triaxial hydraulic fracturing experiments were conducted on layered specimens with diferent\ncombination types of natural sandstone and coal to simulate the propagation behavior of hydraulic fractures. The efects of\nthe fracture initiation position, fracturing fuid viscosity and injection rate were discussed. The results showed that diferent\nfracture morphologies could be found. When initiating from coal seams, three patterns of fracture initiation and propagation were obtained: (1) The main hydraulic fracture initiated and propagated along the natural fractures and then diverged\ndue to the efects of in situ stress and formed secondary fractures. (2) The hydraulic fracture initiated and propagated in the\ndirection of the maximum horizontal stress. (3) Multiple fractures initiated and propagated at the same time. With the same\nfracturing fuid viscosity and injection rate, the hydraulic fractures initiating in sandstones had greater chances than those\nin coal seams to penetrate interfaces and enter neighboring layers. Excessively small or large fracturing fuid viscosity and\ninjection rate would do harm to the vertical extension height of the induced fracture and improvement of the stimulated reservoir volume. Compared with operation parameters (fracturing fuid viscosity and injection rate), the natural weak planes\nin coals were considered to be the key factor that afected the fracture propagation path. The experimental results would\nmake some contributions to the development of tight sandstone\u2013coal interbedded reservoirs.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "PENG TAN  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yan Jin", "Liang Yuan", "Zhen Yu Xiong", "Bing Hou", "Mian Chen", "Li Ming Wan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Hydraulic fracturing ; Fracture propagation ; Sandstone\u2013coal interbed ; Layered formation", "Sumber": "Petroleum Science (2019) 16:148\u2013160 https://doi.org/10.1007/s12182-018-0297-z", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Jan 2019"}
