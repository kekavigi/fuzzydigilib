{"Nomor": 37617, "Judul": "Design of a physical layer security mechanism for CSMA/CD networks", "Abstrak": "CSMA/CD networks (or Ethernets)\nhave become the standard of networking in many\nmedium- to large-scale establishments such as universities,\nresearch laboratories and hospitals.\nHowever, many departments of these establishments\nare reluctant to transmit into these networks\nsensitive information such as examination\npapers and student records in universities, technical\ndata in research laboratories, or patient\nrecords in hospitals. This is due to the fact that all\ndata transmitted into a CSMAjCD network can\nbe received by any station with its network access\ncontroller programmed into the promiscuous\nmode. The paper presents a hardware-oriented\nsecurity scheme for the physical layer of\nCSMA/CD networks. In the scheme, connection\nand data confidentiality in CSMAjCD networks\nare achieved while the broadcast nature of the networks\nis preserved. The basic security mechanism\nis the encipherment of CSMAjCD frames transmitted\nfrom CSMAjCD controllers. This mechanism\nis implemented in a security controller\ninserted between a CSMAjCD controller and its\ntransceiver. In developing the security key management\nmechanism in the security controller, a\nkey number (or key reference) concept was introduced.\nWith this new key number concept, the distribution\nof session keys, either by a key exchange\nor a key distribution centre, becomes unnecessary.\nThe security scheme allows communications in\neither normal or security mode; however, stations\nwithout the security controller can only receive\nframes transitted in the normal mode. Apart from\nthe additional security controller, hardware and\nsoftware alterations are not required to implement\nthe security scheme in any existing CSMAjCD\nnetworks.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "F.S.F.P oon, BSc, DPhil  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["M.S.
