{"Nomor": 33118, "Judul": "Locating magnetic sources by Empirical Mode Decomposition", "Abstrak": "The detection and correct location of magnetic bodies is crucial in geomagnetic explorations. However, the interpretation\nof magnetic anomalies is usually complicated, mostly because of their dipolar nature. In previous studies,\nmany methods had been introduced to locate the edges of magnetic bodies. On the other hand, some of such\nmethods are based on derivative algorithms which are theoretically sensitive to noise in the data. In this paper,\n\u201cEmpirical Mode Decomposition method (EMD)\u201d is investigated as a novel tool to locate magnetic bodies by\nextracting intrinsic mode functions of the magnetic data. The introduced method is a source location detector\nwhile it cannot be considered as an exact edge detection filter. EmpiricalMode Decomposition is a very powerful\nand well-known algorithm in time-frequency analysis of nonlinear and non-stationary signals. Since it is not a\nderivative-based method, it is able to handle the noise involved in data. Although the method has already been\napplied to the potential field to separate regional and local anomalies, in this study, for the first time it is used\nto detect the location of the subsurface magnetic bodies.\nSeveral noisy and noise free synthetic models have been used to verify the efficiency of Empirical Mode Decomposition.\nBesides, for a real test, magnetic data from Sourk mining area in Central Iran have been utilized. Some\nother location detector and edge detector methods, including Horizontal Derivative, Total Gradient, Tilt Angle\nand Enhanced Horizontal Derivative methods, have been applied to synthetic and real magnetic data to compare\nwith results of CEEMD. The results showthat, in the existence of relatively high level of noise (usually more than\n3%), the improved version of Empirical Mode Decomposition, i.e.,Complete Ensemble EmpiricalMode Decomposition\nmethod (CEEMD) has an acceptable resolution in locating magnetic sources. Generally, comparing with\nsome other methods, applying EmpiricalMode Decomposition may lead to more reliable locating adjacent magnetic\nsources with fewer artifacts especially in noisy magnetic data.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Amir Amirpour Asl [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Navid Shad Manaman"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Magnetic body Location determination Empirical Mode Decomposition Sourk mining area", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 159 (2018) 329\u2013340, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.09.001", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Jan 2019"}
