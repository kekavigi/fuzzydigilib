{"Nomor": 36575, "Judul": "Evaporative cooling technologies for greenhouses: a comprehensive review", "Abstrak": "Excessive heat generation by the high solar radiation is the major issue for agricultural greenhouses in hot climatic\nregions. This issue has become the great concern for summer greenhouses and has continuously been under study. Effective\ncooling of greenhouses needs to be undertaken to minimize the issue. There are several techniques of greenhouse cooling and\namong them, evaporative cooling has completely revolutionized the system of cooling in greenhouses since the nineteenth\ncentury and still it is being used around the world. The current paper presents a review study covering the past and the latest\nkinds of evaporative cooling techniques, which have been utilizing for agricultural greenhouses in summer. The paper\nattempted to show the performance characteristics of the individual cooling systems, like fan-pad systems, fog cooled systems,\nroof cooling systems, dissector pad-fan systems, two-stage cooling system and seawater greenhouse systems. A brief survey\nof literature revealed that evaporative cooling could be applied to any environmental condition to reduce greenhouse excess\nthermal load depending upon the types of the system. Finally, some innovative cooling ideas have been provided for further\nstudies.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Debajit Misra [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sudip Ghosh"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Architecture", "Kata Kunci": "evaporative cooling, greenhouse, fan-pad system, fog-cooled, roof cooling, two-stage evaporative cooling, India", "Sumber": "AgricEngInt: CIGR Journal Open access at http://www.cigrjournal.org Vol. 20, No. 1", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Mar 2019"}
