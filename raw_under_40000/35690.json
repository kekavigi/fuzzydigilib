This  study  examines  the  relationship  between  abstract  thinking  ability  and  the pattern of eye gaze in patients with schizophrenia using a novel theme identification task. \nMethods \nTwenty   patients   with   schizophrenia   and   22   healthy   controls   completed the   theme \nidentification  task,  in  which  subjects  selected  which  word,  out  of  a  set  of  provided  words, best  described  the  theme  of  a  picture.  Eye  gaze  while  performing the  task  was  recorded  by \nthe eye tracker. \nResults \nPatients  exhibited  a  significantly  lower  correct  rate  for  theme  identification  and  lesser fixation  and  saccade  counts  than  controls.  The  correct  rate  was  significantly  correlated  with \nthe fixation count in patients, but not in controls. Patients with schizophrenia showed impaired abstract thinking and decreased quality of gaze, which were positively associated with each other. Theme identification and eye  gaze appear to  be  useful  as  tools  for  the  objective  measurement  of  abstract  thinking  in  patients  with schizophrenia.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jooyoung Oh [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ji-Won Chun", "Jung Suk Lee", "Jae-Jin Kim."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Schizophrenia, Abstract thinking, Theme identification, Eye gaze", "Sumber": "Behavioral & Brain Functions. 2014, Vol. 10 Issue 1, p1-17. 17p", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Feb 2019"}
