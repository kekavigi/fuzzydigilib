{"Nomor": 34936, "Judul": "Flexible Electronics toward Wearable Sensing", "Abstrak": "Wearable sensors play a crucial role in realizing personalized medicine, as they can continuously collect data from the human body to capture meaningful health status changes in time for preventive intervention. However, motion artifacts and mechanical mismatches between conventional rigid electronic materials and soft skin often lead to substantial sensor errors during epidermal measurement. Because of its unique properties such as high flexibility and conformability, flexible electronics enables a natural interaction between electronics and the human body. In this Account, we summarize our recent studies on the design of flexible electronic devices and systems for physical and chemical monitoring. Material innovation, sensor design, device fabrication, system integration, and human studies employed toward continuous and noninvasive wearable sensing are\ndiscussed.....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Wei Gao [- ]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hiroki Ota, Daisuke Kiriya, Kuniharu Takei, Ali Javey."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Flexible Electronics, Wearable Sensing", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Feb 2019"}
