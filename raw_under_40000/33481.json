{"Nomor": 33481, "Judul": "Ecotoxicological effects of microplastics: Examination of biomarkers, current state and future perspectives", "Abstrak": "Interest about interactions between microplastics and organisms is on the rise. Accessing organisms'\nresponses to these chemically \u201cinert\u201d compounds plays an important role in determining their potential\ntoxicity. Microplastics from the environment tend to accumulate and move through living organisms,\ninducing a variety of biological effects, such as disturbances in energy metabolism, oxidative balance,\nantioxidative capacity, DNA, immunological, neurological and histological damage. In the present review,\nwe summarized the adverse effects of different size, concentrations and types of microplastics on animals' antioxidative system, energy metabolism and nervous system. Results showed that microplastics\ncan: induce oxidative damage (increased lipid peroxidation and DNA strand breaks); alter antioxidative\nsystem (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase were parameters with the highest\nand significant changes in activities) and metabolism (isocitrate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase activity); and have neurotoxic effects (inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity). The effects were\ndepending on size and dose of used microplastics, and/or their interaction with other xenobiotics. We\nexamined also potential strategies and offer research priorities for current and future studies.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Marko D.
