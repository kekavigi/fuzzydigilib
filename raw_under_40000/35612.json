{"Nomor": 35612, "Judul": "IMPLEMENTATION OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLANNING IN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT-CASE STUDY IN PRAJIN COAL TRANSPORTATION PROJECT PT. BUKIT ASAM", "Abstrak": "In running the company. Management cannot be separated from risk exposure, especially in PT Bukit Asam activity that focus on mining business management, in which it has various project, that one of them is coal transportation infrastructure development project with the objective of enhancing coal capacity up to 10 million ton. Therefore, risks are something that cannot be avoided. Therefore, in order to manage risk effectively, a good implementation of Enterprise Risk Management in the project is required.\nAs a part of risk management implementation process, PTBA has formulated risk management guidelines and risk control policy and measures. However, in the infrastructure development project in Prajin Area South Sumatera, risk management has yet to be implemented integrally because it is still in planning stage. This crucial project is definitely needs risk management system that is structured so that project objectives will be achieved.\nOne of the problems that is encountered in this project activity was the absence of systematic risk management planning. Risk Management is only carried out by following the framework template that is already available, for example ISO 31000: 2018. The preparation of the Risk Breakdown Structure, for example, is not conducted in the risk management stage carried out by the company. In essence, a comprehensive risk management plan document, which describes the stages of risk management from beginning to end is not available. Therefore, the author tries to develop guidelines for project owners in implementing risk management in the form of risk management plan documents so that it can assist project implementers in responding to risk events that occur in the project.\nThis research will be focusing on designing risk management plan, which is the process that is carried out before the beginning of risk management implementation. Risk Management Plan sets the tone for the rest of the risk management efforts. It involves deciding how to process; who should be involved, when risk management activities should be done during the project management life cycle and how frequently they should be done.", "Daftar File": {"2019_TS_PP_FARIS_DZIKRUR_RAHMAN_1-ABSTRAK.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/160582"}, "Penulis": "Faris Dzikrur Rahman [29317008]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
