{"Nomor": 32367, "Judul": "ASSESSMENT OF THE CONTRIBUTION OF FACTOR CONTROLLING EROSION IN CAN GIO, GO CONG DONG, TAN THANH, AND VUNG TAU COAST, SOUTHERN VIETNAM", "Abstrak": "Abstract\nCoastal area of Southern Vietnam is endangered by the erosion, with the recorded\nerosion rate reach estimated 30 m/year. This coastal erosion brings negative impact to\nthe local development on Go Cong Dong, Can Gio, Tan Thanh, and Vung Tau coasts\nof Southern Vietnam. Several factors are contributing to the erosion of those coastal\narea, i.e littoral material composition, water level and long-shore current, wave field,\nwaterway traffic, aquaculture activities, marine sand extraction and lack of supplement\nmaterials. However, factor which dominate the erosion process is still unknown.\nTherefore, the assessment of the each factor influence level in summer and winter\nseason, as well as the dominating coastal erosion factor, are needed. Each factor is\nassessed by pairwise comparison method to calculate the weight of each factor, where\nvalue of bed shear stress at one meter depth is used as comparison variable. Bed shear\nstress is calculated directly using current-generated and wave-generated bed shear\nstress equation, as well as parameters which represent each factor. The result of study\nshows that erosion process near Can Gio, Go Cong Dong, Tan Thanh, and Vung Tau\nCoast in summer season is mostly affected by wave field factor, followed by the effect\nmarine sand extraction, waterway traffic, littoral material composition, longshore\ncurrent, aquaculture activity, and lack of supplement materials factor. Meanwhile,\nerosion process in winter season is mostly affected by marine sand extraction factor,\nfollowed by the effect of wave field, waterway traffic, littoral material composition,\nlongshore current, aquaculture activity, and lack of supplement materials factor.\nCoastal erosion process is equally dominated by activity of wave at shallow water and\nmarine sand extraction factor. Furthermore, it would be a good option for further\nresearch to focus on learn the impact of shallow water wave and sand extraction in\ncausing coastal erosion, as well as for any stakeholders or Government of Vietnam to\nmake suitable action regarding coastal protection by wave impact and sand extraction.", "Daftar File": {"2016_TA_PP_ADI_POETRA_PRATAMA_1-bab_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/145776", "2016_TA_PP_ADI_POETRA_PRATAMA_1-BAB_21.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/145779", "2016_TA_PP_ADI_POETRA_PRATAMA_1-BAB_22.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/145780", "2016_TA_PP_ADI_POETRA_PRATAMA_1-cover.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/145784"}, "Penulis": "Adi Poetra Pratama [15111028]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. rer.nat.
