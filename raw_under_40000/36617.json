{"Nomor": 36617, "Judul": "Strengthening Shale Wellbore With Silica Nanoparticles Drilling Fluid", "Abstrak": "Nanoparticles have been widely used to reduce wellbore instability problems of shale formation. In\nthis paper, nanoparticle-containing water-based drilling fluids (WBDFs) and oil-based drilling fluids\n(OBDFs) were evaluated by running three new tests including spontaneous imbibition, swelling\nrate and acoustic transit time. Results showed that, for the WBDFs, nanoparticles leaded to higher\nplastic viscosity (PV) and yield point (YP), and lower API-filtration. Moreover, because pore throats\nof shale can be plugged by nanoparticles, imbibition amount, swelling rate, and Young's-modulus\nreduction of shale decreased significantly. Higher concentration of nanoparticles can induce better\nplugging effect. However, for the OBDFs, nanoparticles did not show these positive effects like the\nnano WBDFs, even leaded to some negative effects such as higher filtration and larger Young'smodulus reduction. The main reasons are that the silica nanoparticles can easily disperse in the\nWBDFs, and effectively prevent the filtrate invading into shale by plugging pore throats. But the\nsame silica nanoparticles are difficult to disperse in OBDFs, and do not perform the expected\nfunctions. This study indicates that nano WBDFs have great potential to reduce the wellbore\ninstability problems of shale formation.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yili Kang  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jiping She", "Hao Zhang", "Lijun You", "Minggu Song"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Shale, Wellbore instability, Nanoparticles, Strengthen wellbore, Drilling fluid", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 2, Pages 189-195 (June  2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Mar 2019"}
