{"Nomor": 38458, "Judul": "The Impact of Participatory Research on Urban Teens: An Experimental Evaluation", "Abstrak": "Although there is much practice of communitybased participatory research in economically-developing\ncountries and increasingly in North America, there has been little systematic assessment of empowerment effects. Youth-led participatory research holds particular promise for fostering positive development and civic participation among economically disadvantaged urban youth. The present investigation uses a clustered-randomized, withinschool experimental design to test the effects of youth-led participatory research on the psychological empowerment of 401 students attending urban public schools. We find\nthat attending a participatory research elective class during the school day was associated with increases in sociopolitical skills, motivation to influence their schools and communities, and participatory behavior. We found no significant effects for perceived control at school. The implications for participatory research and related youth development interventions are discussed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Emily J.
