{"Nomor": 38418, "Judul": "Effective field theory of force-free electrodynamics", "Abstrak": "Force-free electrodynamics (FFE) is a closed set of equations for the electromagnetic field of a\nmagnetically dominated plasma. There are strong arguments for the existence of force-free plasmas near\npulsars and active black holes, but FFE alone cannot account for the observational signatures, such as\ncoherent radio emission and relativistic jets and winds.We reformulate FFE as the effective field theory of a\ncold string fluid and initiate a systematic study of corrections in a derivative expansion. At leading order the\neffective theory is equivalent to (generalized) FFE, with the strings comprised by magnetic field line world\nsheets. Higher-order corrections generically give rise to nonzero accelerating electric fields (E \u00b7 B ? 0).\nWe discuss potential observable consequences and comment on an intriguing numerical coincidence.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Samuel E.
