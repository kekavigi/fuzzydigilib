{"Nomor": 32490, "Judul": "Transient vibration control using nonlinear convergence active vibration absorber for impulse excitation", "Abstrak": "This paper presents a nonlinear convergence algorithm for active dynamic vibration absor-\nber (ADVA) to control the transient vibration caused by the impulse excitation. The pro-\nposed nonlinear ADVA is made up of equivalent dynamic modeling equations and\nfrequency estimator. The ADVA is mathematically imitated by a mass body and a voice coil\nmotor (VCM). The VCM plays two roles in this study. On one hand, the algorithm-\ncontrolled Lorentz force of the VCM is actively utilized to suppress the transient response\nof primary system. On the other hand, the VCM also acts as a magnetic damper, which\nhelps attenuate the transient vibration passively. The nonlinear convergence estimator is\napplied to simultaneously satisfy the requirements of fast convergence rate and small\nsteady state frequency error, which are incompatible for the linear convergence estimator.\nThe experiments demonstrate that the nonlinear ADVA can shorten 70% of the convergence\ntime than the linear ADVA. The nonlinear ADVA and VCM magnetic damper work together\nand help eliminate 95% of the uncontrolled transient vibration at 1.5 s.\n\u00d3\n2018 Elsevier Ltd.
