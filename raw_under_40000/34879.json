{"Nomor": 34879, "Judul": "Reliability, Availability, Maintainability (RAM) Study, On Reciprocating Compressors API 618", "Abstrak": "The Oil & Gas industry has continuously increased its requirements and together with the high\ncomplexity of technological systems and the higher competitiveness of markets, has compelled\nproviders to implement adequate management strategies for these systems in order to improve\ntheir availability and productivity to meet those more demanding criteria.\nIn this context, the complex of RAM factors constitute a strategic approach for integrating reliability, availability and maintainability, by using methods, tools and engineering techniques (Mean\nTime to Failure, Equipment down Time and System Availability values) to identify and quantify\nequipment and system failures that prevent the achievement of the productive objectives. The\napplication of such methodologies requires a deep experience and know-how together with the\npossibility of acquiring and processing data in operating conditions. This paper presents the most\nrelevant aspects and findings of a study conducted for assessing the operational performance of a\nreciprocating compressor system package installed and used in the oil and gas' industries. The\nstudy was based on the analysis of the behaviour of states defined for each individual parts and\ncomponent of reciprocating compressor and also aimed to identify and evaluate the effects of RAMtype factors and was conducted in collaboration with a private company that, for privacy reasons,\nwill be named RC company. The Methodologies procedures used in this descriptive study were the\nbibliographical research, documentary and content analysis of the main literature. Adopting the\nmost suitable maintenance strategy is one of the main challenges that maintenance managers face.\nThe main purpose of this work is to propose a new approach to evaluate maintenance strategies.\nIn this study, three criteria called reliability, availability and maintainability (RAM) have been\nemployed to compare to future maintenance strategies.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Francesco Corvaro  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Giancarlo Giacchetta", "Barbara Marchetti", "Maurilio Recanati"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "RAM, Reciprocating compressors, Maintenance, Oil & gas", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 3, Issue 2, Pages 266-272 (Juni 2017)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Feb 2019"}
