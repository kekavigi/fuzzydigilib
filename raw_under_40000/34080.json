{"Nomor": 34080, "Judul": "COMPETING UNIVERSALITIES IN KARDAR-PARISI-ZHANG GROWTH MODELS", "Abstrak": "We report on the universality of height fluctuations at the crossing point of two interacting (1 \u00fe 1)-\ndimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang interfaces with curved and flat initial conditions. We introduce a control\nparameter p as the probability for the initially flat geometry to be chosen and compute the phase diagram as\na function of p. We find that the distribution of the fluctuations converges to the Gaussian orthogonal\nensemble Tracy-Widom distribution for p < 0.5, and to the Gaussian unitary ensemble Tracy-Widom\ndistribution for p > 0.5. For p \u00bc 0.5 where the two geometries are equally weighted, the behavior is\ngoverned by an emergent Gaussian statistics in the universality class of Brownian motion. We propose a\nphenomenological theory to explain our findings and discuss possible applications in nonequilibrium\ntransport and traffic flow.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ABBAS ALI SABERI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["HOR DASHTI-NASERABADI,", "AND JOACHIM KRUG"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 122, 040605 (2019); \u00a9 2019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Feb 2019"}
