{"Nomor": 32472, "Judul": "Facebook and academic performance", "Abstrak": "There is much talk of a change in modern youth \u2013 often referred to as digital natives or Homo Zappiens \u2013\nwith respect to their ability to simultaneously process multiple channels of information. In other words,\nkids today can multitask. Unfortunately for proponents of this position, there is much empirical documentation\nconcerning the negative effects of attempting to simultaneously process different streams\nof information showing that such behavior leads to both increased study time to achieve learning parity\nand an increase in mistakes while processing information than those who are sequentially or serially processing\nthat same information. This article presents the preliminary results of a descriptive and exploratory\nsurvey study involving Facebook use, often carried out simultaneously with other study activities,\nand its relation to academic performance as measured by self-reported Grade Point Average (GPA) and\nhours spent studying per week. Results show that Facebook users reported having lower GPAs and\nspend fewer hours per week studying than nonusers.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Paul A.
