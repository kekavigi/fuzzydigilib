{"Nomor": 37648, "Judul": "Transitional behaviour between biphasic lubrication and soft elastohydrodynamic lubrication of poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogel using microelectromechanical system pressure sensor", "Abstrak": "Abstract: The soft hydrogel material is expected for a candidate material as biomimetic artificial cartilage with synergistic functionalities of adaptive multimode lubrication. In boundary lubrication mode of hydrogel material, the biphasic lubrication mechanism cooperatively exerts its functionality. In hydrodynamic lubrication mode, it is preferable that the lubricating surfaces be impermeable to trap the fluid pressure in contact surfaces, whereas the actual biphasic material like a hydrogel is a permeable material with surface porosity. It is indicated that the interstitial fluid pressurisation in the permeable biphasic material can contribute to significant fluid load support under lower sliding speed condition. So, the authors examined how the contrary fluid pressure effect appears in the transition from the boundary lubrication mode to soft elastohydrodynamic lubrication mode. In the experiment, a small pressure sensor was utilised to measure the in-situ fluid pressure in sliding condition. Although the experimental condition of this study was selective, the result showed a possibility of the negative effect of the biphasic surface, in which the permeable surface\ndiminished the hydrodynamic fluid pressure. This means that one should manage and enhance the biphasic lubrication abilities in wide operation range when the hydrogel material was used as a load bearing material.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Nobuo Sakai [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Seido Yarimitsu, Yoshinori Sawae, Mochimitsu Komori, Teruo Murakami"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "biphasic lubrication, soft elastohydrodynamic, microelectromechanical system pressure sensor", "Sumber": "Biosurface and Biotribology IET JOURNALS", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Apr 2019"}
