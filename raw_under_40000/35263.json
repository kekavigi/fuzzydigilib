{"Nomor": 35263, "Judul": "Seismic Health Monitoring of a Space Reinforced Concrete Frame Structure Using Piezoceramic-Based Sensors", "Abstrak": ": In this study, a piezoelectric-based active sensing system was used to conduct the structural health monitoring (SHM) of a\none-bay, two-story reinforced concrete (RC) space frame structure subjected to earthquake loadings. The RC frame in which were installed\npiezoelectric-based actuators and sensors was tested on a shaking table with ground excitation of various intensities. The embedded\nsensors in the RC frame were used to diagnose the health status of the tested RC frame during the tests, and an energy-base damage\nindex was adopted to quantify the severity of the damage. The test results indicate that the piezoelectric-based active sensing method for\nSHM revealed the severity of damage of the tested RC frame after earthquake excitations. A simplified and accurate method for simulating\nthe dynamic responses of the tested RC space frame is presented; it was based on the moment-curvature method and identified fundamental\nfrequencies. The calculated displacement time histories and maximum ductility demands of the structural members were compared with\nthose measured in the shake table test, and excellent agreement was achieved.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP WEN-I LIAO 1": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/159358"}, "Penulis": "Wen-I Liao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Chien-Kuo Chiu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Concrete Frame Structure,  Piezoceramic-Based Sensors", "Sumber": "Journal of Aerospace Engineering ISSN (print): 0893-1321 | ISSN (online): 1943-5525 Frequency: Bimonthly | Sponsored by the Aerospace Division", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Feb 2019"}
