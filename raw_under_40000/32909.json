{"Nomor": 32909, "Judul": "Office versus leisure environments: Effects of surroundings on concentration", "Abstrak": "Mobile workers perform tasks that require high concentration not only in their traditional office but also within\nenvironments that are typically related to leisure (e.g., in a park or in the living room). Because research has\nshown that surroundings affect cognitive processing, we assume that concentration is different in office versus in\nleisure environments. We hypothesize that a typical office activates an associated (work-related) schema which\nin turn positively influences processes that are normally conducted within the environment (e.g., show high\nconcentration in work-related activities in the office). In two studies, we assessed participants\u2019 objective and\nsubjective work-related concentration twice, each time once within an office and once within a leisure environment. In study 1 (laboratory), we manipulated environments by means of virtual realities. In study 2 (field\nexperiment), participants were tested within their self-elected, real-life environments. In both studies, results\nindicated higher work-related concentration when surrounded by an office compared to a leisure environment.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Carolin P.
