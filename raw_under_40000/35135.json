Supercritical CO2 is injected into a reservoir and dissolves in the brine. Under the impact\nof pressure and temperature (PeT) the aqueous species of the CO2-acidified brine diffuse through\nthe cap rock where they trigger CO2ewatererock interactions. These geochemical reactions result\nin mineral dissolution and precipitation along the CO2 migration path and are responsible for a\nchange in porosity and therefore for the sealing capacity of the cap rock. This study focuses on the\ndiffusive mass transport of CO2 along a gradient of decreasing PeT conditions. The process is\nretraced with a one-dimensional hydrogeochemical reactive mass transport model. The semigeneric hydrogeochemical model is based on chemical equilibrium thermodynamics. Based on a\nbroad variety of scenarios, including different initial mineralogical, chemical and physical parameters, the hydrogeochemical parameters that are most sensitive for safe long-term CO2 storage are\nidentified. The results demonstrate that PeT conditions have the strongest effect on the change in\nporosity and the effect of both is stronger at high PeT conditions because the solubility of the\nmineral phases involved depends on PeT conditions. Furthermore, modeling results indicate that\nthe change in porosity depends strongly on the initial mineralogical composition of the reservoir\nand cap rock as well as on the brine compositions. Nevertheless, a wide range of conditions for safe\nCO2 storage is identified", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Christina Hemme [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wolfgang van Berk"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Rock Porosity Triggered, Pressure And Temperature Dependent CO2 \u2013 Water-Rock, CO2 Storage Systems, mineral", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 3, Issue 1, Pages 96-108 (March 2017)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Feb 2019"}
