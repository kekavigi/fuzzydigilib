In order to more effectively characterize the\nmicroscopic pore structure of gas hydrate reservoirs and conduct relevant characterization analysis, digital\nrock model was constructed based on high-resolution CT scanning of gas hydrate reservoir rock samples. The relevant pore structure parameters were obtained by numerical simulation methods. The pore structure was characterized and analyzed by the fractal theory of porous media. High-resolution CT scanning and numerical\nsimulations of rock physics show that the pore size of the rock sample is mainly distributed within the range\nof 1-5um. The rock sample is mainly based on microscopic pores, and the microscopic pores provide most of\nthe pore volume. Fractal dimension analysis results show that the fractal dimension of the gas hydrate reservoir\nrock presents a distinct linearly segmentation feature. The fractal dimension of the rock pores in the interval I\nranged from 2.214 to 2.714, indicating that the small pores were evenly distributed in the interval I, and ranged\nfrom 2.869 to 2.988 in the interval II, indicating that the pore distribution uniformity was poor in the interval II. In\naddition, there is a certain correlation between the pore fractal dimension D1, D2 and the porosity, permeability\nand average pore radius of gas hydrate reservoir in a whole. The fractal dimension D1 is positively correlated with\nporosity, permeability, and average pore radius. The fractal dimension D2 is negatively correlated with porosity,\npermeability, and average pore radius", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Dong Huaimin  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sun Jianmenga, Cui Likai, Golsanami Naser, Yan Weichao"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Natural gas hydrate Pore structure Digital rock Fractal theory Fractal dimension", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2019.03.005", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Apr 2019"}
