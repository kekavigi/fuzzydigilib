M-ary frequency-shift-keying\n(MFSK) modulation with noncoherent square-law\nenvelope demodulation and Reed-Solomon (RS)\ncoding is considered. Results obtained in this\nstudy show that an FFH-SSMA system is not sensitive\nto the changes in the number of paths.\nEmploying RS coding with an increased number\nM of MFSK signals yields a significant improvement\nin BER performance. Assuming a given\nsystem bandwidth, using a single hop per symbol\nis the best solution when the multiaccess interference\ncan be large. Using several hops per\nsymbol is more advantageous when the multiaccess\ninterference is small.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "M. Moeneclaey, PhD  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["J.
