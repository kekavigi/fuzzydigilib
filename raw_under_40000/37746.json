{"Nomor": 37746, "Judul": "A magnetar-powered X-ray transient as the aftermath of a binary neutron-star merger", "Abstrak": "Mergers of neutron stars are known to be associated with short ?-ray bursts1\u20134\n. If the neutron-star equation of state is sufficiently stiff (that is, the pressure increases sharply as the density increases), at least some such mergers will leave behind a supramassive or even a stable neutron star that spins rapidly with a strong magnetic field5\u20138 (that is, a magnetar). Such a magnetar signature may have been observed in the form of the X-ray plateau that follows up to half of observed short ?-ray bursts9,10. However, it has been expected that some X-ray transients powered by binary neutron-star mergers may not be associated with a short ?-ray burst11,12. A fast X-ray\ntransient (CDF-S XT1) was recently found to be associated with a faint host galaxy, the redshift of which is unknown13. Its X-ray and host-galaxy properties allow several possible explanations including a short ?-ray burst seen off-axis, a low-luminosity ?-ray burst at high redshift, or a tidal disruption event involving an intermediatemass black hole and a white dwarf13. Here we report a second X-ray transient, CDF-S XT2, that is associated with a galaxy at redshift z = 0.738 (ref. 14). The measured light curve is fully consistent with the X-ray transient being powered by a millisecond magnetar. More\nintriguingly, CDF-S XT2 lies in the outskirts of its star-forming host galaxy with a moderate offset from the galaxy centre, as short ?-ray bursts often do15,16. The estimated event-rate density of similar X-ray transients, when corrected to the local value, is consistent with the event-rate density of binary neutron-star mergers that is\nrobustly inferred from the detection of the gravitational-wave event GW170817.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Y.Q.
