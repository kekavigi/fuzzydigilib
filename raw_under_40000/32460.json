The work sampling was applied to evaluate the efficiency of machines and men. The facility layout was improved by applying the systematic layout planning so as to reduce the waiting time and handling waste; the multi-machine-tools operation strategy was designed by applying man-machine operation analysis to reduce workers waiting time; in addition, some other improvement suggestions were proposed from the angle of group technology and part\u2019s moving method. The work sampling shows that these improvement measures can improve the workshop\u2019s production efficiency effectively at lower cost", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Cao Yang-hua1 [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Kang Xiu-cui2"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "production management; work sampling; systematic layout planning; man-machine operation analysis", "Sumber": "Applied Mechanics and Materials Vol. 685 (2014) pp 693-696 Submitted: 10.09.2014 \u00a9 (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland Revised: 11.09.2014 doi:10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.685.693", "Staf Input/Edit": "Dewi Supryati", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
