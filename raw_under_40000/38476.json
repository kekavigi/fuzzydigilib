{"Nomor": 38476, "Judul": "Complex F\ufffd\ufffdrster Energy Transfer Interactions between Semiconductor Quantum Dots and a Redox-Active Osmium Assembly", "Abstrak": "The ability of luminescent semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) to engage in\ndiverse energy transfer processes with organic\ndyes, light-harvesting proteins, metal complexes,\nand redox-active labels continues to stimulate interest in developing them for biosensing and\nlight-harvesting applications. Within biosensing configurations, changes in the rate of energy\ntransfer between the QD and the proximal donor, or acceptor, based upon some external\n(biological) event form the principle basis for signal transduction. However, designing QD\nsensors to function optimally is predicated on a full understanding of all relevant energy\ntransfer mechanisms. In this report, we examine energy transfer between a range of\nCdSeZnS coreshell QDs and a redox-active osmium(II) polypyridyl complex. To facilitate\nthis, the Os complex was synthesized as a reactive isothiocyanate and used to label a\nhexahistidine-terminated peptide. The Os-labeled peptide was ratiometrically self-assembled\nto the QDs via metal affinity coordination, bringing the Os complex into close proximity of the\nnanocrystal surface. QDs displaying different emission maxima were assembled with\nincreasing ratios of Ospeptide complex and subjected to detailed steady-state, ultrafast\ntransient absorption, and luminescence lifetime decay analyses. Although the possibility exists\nfor charge transfer quenching interactions, we find that the QD donors engage in relatively\nefficient F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer with the Os complex acceptor despite relatively low\noverall spectral overlap. These results are in contrast to other similar QD donorredox-active\nacceptor systems with similar separation distances, but displaying far higher spectral overlap,\nwhere charge transfer processes were reported to be the dominant QD quenching mechanism", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Michael H.
