{"Nomor": 37557, "Judul": "How can Psych ology inform disaster research ?", "Abstrak": "This paper will set out our current understanding of how psychology can help us to understand and influence preparation for, and responses to disaster. Using four primary research studies, this paper will outline how psychology can inform our knowledge of all stages of a disaster (preparedness, immediate response and long-term consequences). The first study used a questionnaire design \nto examine factors that influence evacuation behaviours. The second and third studies explored\nphysiological and psychological responses to simulated disaster training. The fourth study explored the consequences of trauma exposure focusing specifically on predictors  of  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  and  post-traumatic  growth.The  results  show  that  psychology can play  a role  in  our  \nunderstanding of human behaviour during a disaster. Specifically, study one shows how psychology can inform disaster preparation by identifying barriers to evacuation. The second and third studies show how psychology can help us to explore and predict human behaviour during a disaster. Finally, the fourth study highlights how psychology can help us to understand the longer-term impact \nof exposure to traumatic events. Overall, the results of these studies show that psychological knowledge can predict and positively influence human behaviour in response to disasters.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Sarita J Robinson [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "disaster management; psychology ; evacuation; human factors;  disaster; preparedness; resilience #", "Sumber": "Procedia Engineering 212 (2018)  1083\u20131090", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Apr 2019"}
