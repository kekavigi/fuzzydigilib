Therefore, the effective and efficient removal of contaminants from water has\nbecome a hot topic. As a fast-growing branch of coordination chemistry, metal\u2013organic frameworks\n(MOFs) with tailorable porous structures and numerous active sites have proved to be ideal adsorbents\nor photocatalysts for water purification. In this review, recent advances in the removal and degradation of\nwater pollutants by MOFs are highlighted. In addition, the challenges and prospects in this active field are\nalso briefly discussed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Qiang Gao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jian Xu.,Xian-He Bu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Metal\u2013organic frameworks Pollutant removal Wastewater Adsorption Photocatalytic degradation", "Sumber": "Coordination Chemistry Reviews 378 (2019) 17\u201331", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Mar 2019"}
