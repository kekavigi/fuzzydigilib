{"Nomor": 33235, "Judul": "Research On Shape Parameters Of Circular Arc Disc Teeth For Three-Cone Bit", "Abstrak": "Through the single row drilling experiment, this paper studied the regularity of the tooth shape parameter's influence to the disc teeth's rock-breaking effect, which provided some basis for the composite\nteeth type roller bit's combined experimental study and the structure design of the tooth type. This\nexperimental research is only for the circular arc disc teeth which is arranged on the composite teeth\ntype roller bit's main tooth. The experiments were designed using the method of orthogonal design and\nthe results were analyzed by the fuzzy optimization method. The results show that the disc tooth's\ndrilling effect is the best when the tip diameter is 2 mm, taper angle is 30 and the groove number is 8,\nand the disc tooth's drilling effect is the second best when the tip diameter is 3 mm, taper angle is 30\nand the groove number is 7. The above two combined ways of drilling effect's difference is very small (the\ndifference of the degree of the membership is 0.003).", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "QIN HU [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Huan Zhu, Hang Ren"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Tooth shape parameters, Rock-breaking experiments, Orthogonal design, Fuzzy analysis", "Sumber": "Petroleum 4 (2018) 108-114 - KeAi, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2017.12.001", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Jan 2019"}
