{"Nomor": 38471, "Judul": "Nano-\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdSqueegee\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd for the Creation of Clean 2D Material Interfaces", "Abstrak": "Two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit many exciting phenomena that make them promising as materials for\nfuture electronic, optoelectronic, and mechanical devices. Because of their atomic thinness, interfaces play a dominant role in\ndetermining material behavior. In order to observe and exploit the unique properties of these materials, it is therefore vital to\nobtain clean and repeatable interfaces. However, the conventional mechanical stacking of atomically thin layers typically leads to\ntrapped contaminants and spatially inhomogeneous interfaces, which obscure the true intrinsic behavior. This work presents a\nsimple and generic approach to create clean 2D material interfaces in mechanically stacked structures. The operating principle is\nto use an AFM tip to controllably squeeze contaminants out from between 2D layers and their substrates, similar to a \u201csqueegee\u201d.\nThis approach leads to drastically improved homogeneity and consistency of 2D material interfaces, as demonstrated by AFM\ntopography and significant reduction of photoluminescence line widths. Also, this approach enables emission from interlayer\nexcitons, demonstrating that the technique enhances interlayer coupling in van der Waals heterostructures. The technique\nenables repeatable observation of intrinsic 2D material properties, which is crucial for the continued development of these\npromising materials.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Matthew R.
