{"Nomor": 35266, "Judul": "Hydrogen bioproduction with anaerobic bacteria consortium from brewery wastewater", "Abstrak": "Biohydrogen production is a cheap and clean way to obtain hydrogen gas. In subtropical\ncountries such as Brazil the average temperatures of 27 C can favor the hydrogen producing\nbacteria growth. A mixed culture was obtained from a subtropical sludge treating brewery\nwastewater and anaerobic batch reactors were fed with glucose, sucrose, fructose and xylose\nin low concentrations (2.0, 5.0 and 10.0 g L1\n) at 37 C, initial pH 5.5 and headspace with N2\n(99%) to maintain the anaerobic conditions. The inoculum was a subtropical granulated\nsludge from UASB (Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket) reactor treating brewery wastewater.\nThe higher H2 yields were obtained in reactors operated with 2 and 5 g L1of fructose and they\nwere 1.5 mol H2 mol1 of fructose and 1.3 mol H2 mol1 of sucrose, respectively. The volatile\nfatty acids (VFA) generated at the end of operation were, predominantly, butyric and acetic\nacid, indicating the favoring of themetabolic route of hydrogen generation by the consortium\nof anaerobic bacteria from the brewery wastewater. Biomolecular analyses revealed the\npredominance of hydrogen producing bacteria from Firmicutes phylum distributed in the\nfamilies Streptococcaceae, Veillonellaceae and uncultured bacteria. These results confirm future\napplications of subtropical sludges with agroindustrial wastewaters containing low concentrations of sugars on hydrogen generation", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Renan Pachiega [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mayara Franco Rodrigues.,Caroline Varella Rodrigues .,Isabel Kimiko Sakamoto.,Maria Bernadete A.
