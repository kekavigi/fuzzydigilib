{"Nomor": 33970, "Judul": "Disruption of the Orion molecular core 1 by wind from the massive star ?1  Orionis C", "Abstrak": "Massive stars inject mechanical and radiative energy into the surrounding environment, which stirs it up, heats the gas, produces cloud and intercloud phases in the interstellar medium, and disrupts\nmolecular clouds (the birth sites of new stars1,2). Stellar winds, supernova explosions and ionization by ultraviolet photons control the lifetimes of molecular clouds3\u20137. Theoretical studies predict that\nmomentum injection by radiation should dominate that by stellar winds8, but this has been difficult to assess observationally. Velocityresolved large-scale images in the fine-structure line of ionized\ncarbon ([C ii]) provide an observational diagnostic for the radiative energy input and the dynamics of the interstellar medium around massive stars. Here we report observations of a one-square-degree\nregion (about 7 parsecs in diameter) of Orion molecular core 1\u2014 the region nearest to Earth that exhibits massive-star formation\u2014 at a resolution of 16 arcseconds (0.03 parsecs) in the [C ii] line at 1.9 terahertz (158 micrometres). The results reveal that the stellar wind originating from the massive star ?1\n Orionis C has swept up the surrounding material to create a \u2018bubble\u2019 roughly four parsecs\nin diameter with a 2,600-solar-mass shell, which is expanding at 13 kilometres per second. This finding demonstrates that the mechanical energy from the stellar wind is converted very efficiently\ninto kinetic energy of the shell and causes more disruption of the Orion molecular core 1 than do photo-ionization and evaporation or future supernova explosions", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "C.
