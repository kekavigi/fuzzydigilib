Si\nnce, the bulk of the sales in these outlets  were  based  on  impulsive  buying;  hence,  aim  of  this  study  was  to  measure  the  effect  of  visual  merchandising,  sensational  seeking,  and collectivism  on  impulsive  buying  behavior.  Visual  Merchandising Scale (Kim, 2003; Faber, 2000), Sensation Seeking Scale  (Kacen  &  Lee,  2002),  Collectivism  Scale  (Kacen  &  Lee,  2002), and Impulsive Buying Scale (Kim, 2003; Faber, 2000) were administered  on  sample.  Mall  intercept  method  was  used  for  data  collection  from  a  convenient  sample  (N  =  300)  and  data  was  analyzed   with   multiple   step   procedure   inclusive   of   validity   analyses and confirmatory factor analysis for all the constructs and model through structural equation modeling. Results revealed that a  strong  and  positive  relationship  existed  between  sensational  seeking   and   impulsive   buying.   On   the   other   hand,   visual   merchandising  and  collectivism  had  nonsignificant  relationship  with  impulsive  buying.  Inference  of  the  present  study  indicated  that  retailing  outlets  in  Pakistan  had  been  in  initial  stages  of  development and the visual merchandising strategies used in local \nstares  had  not  been  adequate  enough  to  make  an  impact  on  consumers.   The   major   contribution   of   this   study   was   the   exploration of relationships of collectivism and sensational seeking with   impulsive buying which was  relatively newer arena   of  consumer behavior in Pakistan.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Tariq Jalees  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mustaghis-ur-Rahman"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Impulsive  buying,  sensational  seeking,  innovation,   visual merchandising, collectivism, consumer behavior", "Sumber": "Pakistan Journal of Psychological Research,  2018, Vol. 33, No. 1, 177-190", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Apr 2019"}
