It is essential to reconstruct and\npredict capillary pressure curve properly. Many traditional capillary pressure correlations have been\nsuggested in the literature. However, their major limitation is mainly applicable to homogenous reservoir, and the larger error will be caused when heterogeneous reservoir is dealt by using these mathematical correlations. This study aims at providing an important method based on Particle Swarm\nOptimization-Back Propagation Neural Network (PSO-BP neural network) to represent and predict\ncapillary pressure curve for homogenous and heterogeneous reservoir. The combination of PSO algorithm and BP neural network converges quickly, which improves the accuracy and efficiency of simulation. In this paper, core samples from three blocks of the same marine-sand reservoir, whose porosity is\nbetween 0.6% and 20.0% and permeability is between 0.1mD and 6117mD, are investigated by PSO-BP\nneural network method and J-Function method respectively. The reconstruction and prediction results\nare compared with the results obtained by mercury intrusion method in laboratory. The results show\nthat capillary pressure curves reconstructed and predicted by PSO-BP neural network method are in\nbetter agreement with mercury intrusion curves than J-Function method, with 0.1%e5% and 5%e8%\nrelative error respectively, which can totally meet the in-situ requirements. It is also demonstrated that\nPSO-BP neural network method is more suitable for homogenous and heterogeneous reservoir", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "LIJUN YOU [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Qigui Tan, Yili Kang, Chengyuan Xu, Chong Lin"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Capillary pressure curve, Homogenous reservoir, Heterogeneous reservoir, PSO-BP neural netw", "Sumber": "Petroleum 4 (2018) 268-280 - KeAi, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.03.004", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Jan 2019"}
