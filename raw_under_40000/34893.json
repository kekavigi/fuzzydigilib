The history of discovery of these oil accumulations resulted in the\nfields being given several different names. The Weyburn field\nand the immediately-adjacent Midale field are effectively part\nof a larger oil pool with OOIP (original oil in place) reserves of\nover 2 billion barrels. This is certainly a large conventional oil\npool for Canada even if not large by world standards.\nThese pools are found in truncated stratigraphic traps and\noccur at about 1450e1550 m depth making them ideal for CO2\nstorage", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ken Brown  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Steve Whittaker", "Malcolm Wilson", "Wayuta Srisang, Heidi Smithson", "Paitoon Tontiwachwuthikul"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "IEA GHG Weyburn-Midale CO2 Monitoring, the world largest CO2 for EOR and CCS program", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 3, Issue 2, Pages 3-9 (March 2017)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Feb 2019"}
