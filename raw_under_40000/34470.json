{"Nomor": 34470, "Judul": "ARTS AND CRAFTS IN IRON AGE BRITAIN: RECONSIDERING THE AESTHETIC EFFECTS OF WEAVING COMBS", "Abstrak": "Recent years have witnessed the formal acknowledgement of the\nprivileged position from which decorative media in Iron Age Britain have\ntraditionally been studied. Tension remains, however, between the study of the\ndecorated metals that formed the basis for models of Celtic expansion, and\ndecorated non-metals. Despite the general paucity of decoration in Iron Age\nBritain, decorated non-metals are still not viewed in the same light of social\nsignificance as metals. This paper will examine weaving combs from\nGlastonbury Lake Village, highly decorated objects of antler and bone. By\nconcentrating on the fabrication and display of weaving combs, I aim to\nhighlight the potential significance of the aesthetic effects of these objects.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "HELEN CHITTOCK [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Craft, aesthetic, weaving", "Sumber": "Oxford Journal of Archaeology.
