{"Nomor": 38406, "Judul": "Ten Steps for Conceptualizing and Conducting Qualitative Research Studies in a Pragmatically Curious Manner", "Abstrak": "In a world of methodological pluralism and mixed-methods, qualitative researchers can take a pathway of pragmatic curiosity by exploring their research interests and the possible design and methodology choices to\ncreate studies that not only allow them to pursue their investigative curiosities, but also result in coherent and effective systems of procedural choices. Ten steps are offered for researchers to conceive and conduct\nqualitative research projects that are both responsive to research goals and objectives and defendable to criteria of quality and critics of utility.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ronald J.
