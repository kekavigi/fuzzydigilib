{"Nomor": 36622, "Judul": "Post flooding damage assessment of earth dams and historical reservoirs using non-invasive geophysical techniques", "Abstrak": "This paper describes the use of four geophysical techniques to map the structural integrity of historical earth reservoir embankments which are susceptible to natural decay with time.\nThe four techniques that were used to assess the post flood damage were 1. A fast scanning technique using a dipole electromagnetic profile apparatus (GEM2), 2. Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) in order to obtain a\nhigh resolution image of the shape of the damaged/seepage zone, 3. Self-Potential surveys were carried out to relate the detected seepage evolution and change of the water displacement inside the embankment, 4. The\nwashed zone in the areas with piping was characterised with microgravimetry.\nThe four geophysical techniques used were evaluated against the case studies of two reservoirs in South Bohemia,\nCzech Republic. A risk approach based on the Geophysical results was undertaken for the reservoir embankments. The four techniques together enabled a comprehensive non-invasive assessment whereby remedial action could be recommended where required. Conclusions were also drawn on the efficiency of the techniques\nto be applied for embankments with wood structures.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Philippe Sentenac [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Vojtech Benes, Vladimir Budinsky, Helen Keenan, Ron Baron"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Slingram Electrical Resistivity Tomography Geophysics Microgravimetry Seepage Piping Earth Dam Reservoirs", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 146 (2017) 138\u2013148, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.09.006", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Mar 2019"}
