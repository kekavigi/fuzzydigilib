The current study explored the joint effects\nof five personality traits (i.e., extraversion, openness, neuroticism, normlessness and altruism)\nand global perceived stress (measured with the Perceived Stress Scale-10) on pedestrian\nbehavior (measured with the Pedestrian Behavior Scale) in 311 Chinese individuals.\nResults showed that altruism, neuroticism and openness significantly affected different\npedestrian behavior dimensions, while global perceived stress also significantly and positively\npredicted positive behavior. Moreover, the effect of neuroticism on positive behavior\nwas fully mediated by stress. Some explanations and implications are provided in the discussion\nsection.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Tingting Zheng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Weina Qu, Yan Ge, Xianghong Sun, Kan Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "personality traits; perceived stress ; pedestrian behavior ; Chinese", "Sumber": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0188153 November 30, 2017", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Mar 2019"}
