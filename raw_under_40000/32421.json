Studies that focus on these issues tend to examine infrastructures in isolation from each other, and tend to work with evolutionary accounts of incremental change punctuated by short periods of radical innovation. This paper questions both these abstractions. Using four empirical cases, it directs attention to intersections between infrastructures at speci?c times and places, highlighting the dynamic qualities of infrastructures-in-use, and conceptualising societal transformations as outcomes of these intersections. Four forms of intersection are elaborated \u2013 co-constitution, adaptation and threading through, historical layering, and coexisting con?gurations. Instances of each are used to illustrate some of complex and often ambiguous processes through which infrastructures interact. The paper ends by outlining implications for future research and for interventions by policy-makers and others seeking to in?uence the ways in which infrastructures intersect.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "NOEL CASS [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Tim Schwanenb.", "Elizabeth Shovea"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Infrastructure, Intersection, Societal transformation, Innovation", "Sumber": "Technological Forecasting & Social Change 137 (2018) 160\u2013167", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yoninur Almira", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
