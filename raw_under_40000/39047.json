{"Nomor": 39047, "Judul": "Low-Cost and Green Fabrication of Polymer Electronic Devices by Push-Coating of the Polymer Active Layers", "Abstrak": "Because of both its easy processability and\ncompatibility with roll-to-roll processes, polymer electronics is\nconsidered to be the most promising technology for the future\ngeneration of low-cost electronic devices such as light-emitting\ndiodes and solar cells. However, the state-of-the-art deposition\ntechnique for polymer electronics (spin-coating) generates a\nhigh volume of chlorinated solution wastes during the active\nlayer fabrication. Here, we demonstrate that devices with\nsimilar or higher performances can be manufactured using the\npush-coating technique in which a poly(dimethylsiloxane)\n(PDMS) layer is simply laid over a very small amount of solution (less than 1?L/covered cm2\n), which is then left for drying.\nUsing mm thick PDMS provides a means to control the solvent diffusion kinetics (sorption/retention) and removes the necessity\nfor additional applied pressure to generate the desired active layer thickness. Unlike spin-coating, push-coating is a slow drying\nprocess that induces a higher degree of crystallinity in the polymer thin film without the necessity for a post-annealing step. The\npolymer light-emitting diodes and solar cells prepared by push-coating exhibit slightly higher performances with respect to the\nreference spin-coated devices, whereas at the same time reduce the amounts of active layer materials and chlorinated solvents by\n50 and 20 times, respectively. These increased performances can be correlated to the higher polymer crystallinities obtained\nwithout applying a post-annealing treatment. As push-coating is a roll-to-roll compatible method, the results presented here open\nthe path to low-cost and eco-friendly fabrication of a wide range of emerging devices based on conjugated polymer materials.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Varun Vohra 1.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170903"}, "Penulis": "Varun Vohra [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wojciech Mroz, Shusei Inaba,William Porzio,Umberto Giovanella,Francesco Galeotti"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "polymer solar cells, OLED, OPV, coating methods, organic semiconductor, thin films, PDMS", "Sumber": "www.acsami.org   DOI: 10.1021/acsami.7b07857 ACS Appl.
