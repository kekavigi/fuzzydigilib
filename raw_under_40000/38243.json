{"Nomor": 38243, "Judul": "INSTITUTIONALIZING CULTURAL STUDIES IN COLOMBIA or, an argument about Marx and Foucault", "Abstrak": "In  this  article,  I  locate  the  institutionalization  of  Cultural  Studies  in  the Departamento de Lenguajes y Estudios Socioculturales in the Universidad de Los Andes,  Bogota ?,  Colombia.  The  conditions  of  possibility  of  the  said  institutionalization   are   ascribed   to   something   like   a   crisis,   itself   engendered   by   the encroachment  of  neoliberal  ideology  on  the  University\u2019s  sense  of  mission  and understanding  of  itself.  Essentially,  a  more  or  less  traditional  department  of modern  languages  was  abolished  and  a  potentially  innovative  but  epistemologi-\ncally fuzzy department devoted to teaching language and the linguistic turn, each informed  by  the  other,  was  cobbled  together  in  its  place.  This  required  the  retooling of the department\u2019s professors, but also the hiring of new professors who influenced   the   department\u2019s   intellectual   direction   and   contributed   to   the sharpening of the project. The article then describes how the incipient programme was the site of a struggle for epistemological clarity, which is here represented in\nthe form of an argument about the necessity of thinking both Foucault and Marx together in the project of critical Cultural Studies.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Gregory J.
