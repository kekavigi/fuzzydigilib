{"Nomor": 37634, "Judul": "Resist-Free Direct Stamp Imprinting of GaAs via Metal-AssistedChemical Etching", "Abstrak": "We introduce a method for the directimprinting of GaAs substrates using wet-chemical stamping.The predefined patterns on the stamps etch the GaAssubstrates via metal-assisted chemical etching. This is aresist-free method in which the stamp and the GaAs substrateare directly pressed together. Imprinting and etching occurconcurrently until the stamp is released from the substrate.The stamp imprinting results in a three-dimensionalanisotropic etching profile and does not impair the semi-conductor crystallinity in the wet-chemical bath. Hole, trench,and complex patterns can be imprinted on the GaAs substrateafter stamping with pillar,fin, and letter shapes. In addition,we demonstrate the formation of sub-100 nm trench patternson GaAs through a single-step stamping process. Consecutive imprinting using a single stamp is possible, demonstrating therecyclability of the stamp, which can be used more than 10 times. The greatest benefit of this technique is the simple method ofpatterning by integrating the lithographic and etching processes, making this a high-throughput and low-cost technique.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Kyunghwan_Kim_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/165131"}, "Penulis": "Kyunghwan Kim [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Bugeun Ki, Keorock Choi, Seungmin Lee, and Jungwoo Oh"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "resist-free direct imprinting, nanoimprint lithography, metal-assisted chemical etching, nanostructure,chemical imprinting, GaAs", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
