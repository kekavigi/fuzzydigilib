{"Nomor": 36066, "Judul": "A Bismuth Metal?Organic Framework as a Contrast Agent for X?rayComputed Tomography", "Abstrak": "A new bismuth metal?organic framework (MOF), bismuth-NU-901 (Bi-NU-901), featuring thescutopology and a pore with a diameter of?11 \u00c5,was solvothermally synthesized, and its use as an X-ray computed tomography(CT) contrast agent was tested. X-ray CT is a common diagnostic method used inthe medicalfield. Inside the body, contrast media enhance the distinction betweentissues and organs of similar density. Bi-NU-901 consists of eight connected Bi6nodes and tetratopic 1,3,5,8-(p-benzoate)pyrene linkers (TBAPy). Numerousmaterial characterization studies including powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD),scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and DFT pore sizedistribution support thescustructure. Additionally, given the framework\u2019s highdensity of nontoxic heavy atoms, Bi-NU-901 was evaluated as an X-ray computedtomography (CT) agent. Importantly,in vitrostudies revealed this new bismuthMOF demonstrates?7 times better contrast intensity compared to a zirconiumMOF featuring the same topology and?14 times better contrast than acommercially available CT contrast agent. These results suggest bismuth MOFs may be promising CT contrast agents", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Lee_Robison_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/161505"}, "Penulis": "Lee Robison [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Lin Zhang,Riki J.
