{"Nomor": 36765, "Judul": "Geometric factor and influence of sensors in the establishment of a resistivity-moisture relation in soil samples", "Abstrak": "Prior to field scale research, soil samples are analysed on a laboratory scale for electrical resistivity calibrations.\nCurrently, there are a variety of field instruments to estimate the water content in soils using different physical\nphenomena. These instruments can be used to develop moisture-resistivity relationships on the same soil\nsamples. This assures that measurements are performed on the same material and under the same conditions\n(e.g., humidity and temperature). A geometric factor is applied to the location of electrodes, in order to calculate\nthe apparent electrical resistivity of the laboratory test cells. This geometric factor can be determined in three different ways: by means of the use of an analytical approximation, laboratory trials (experimental approximation),\nor by the analysis of a numerical model. The first case, the analytical approximation, is not appropriate for\ncomplex cells or arrays. And both, the experimental and numerical approximation can lead to inaccurate results.\nTherefore, we propose a novel approach to obtain a compromise solution between both techniques, providing a\nmore precise determination of the geometrical factor", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "M.
