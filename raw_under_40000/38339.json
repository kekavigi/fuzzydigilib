{"Nomor": 38339, "Judul": "Anomalous Floquet insulators", "Abstrak": "Landau\u2019s theory of phase transitions provides a framework for describing phases of matter in thermodynamicequilibrium.  Recently,  an  intriguing  new  class  of  quantum  many-body  localized  (MBL)  systems  that  do  notreach  thermodynamic  equilibrium  was  discovered.  The  possibility  of  MBL  systems  to  not  heat  up  underperiodic driving, which drastically changes the nature of dynamics in the system, opens the door for new, trulynonequilibrium phases of matter. In this paper we find a two-dimensional nonequilibrium topological phase, theanomalous Floquet insulator (AFI), which arises from the combination of periodic driving and MBL. Having nocounterpart in equilibrium, the AFI is characterized by an MBL bulk, and topologically protected delocalized(thermalizing) chiral states at its boundaries. After establishing the regime of stability of the AFI phase in asimple yet experimentally realistic model, we investigate the interplay between the thermalizing edge and thelocalized bulk via numerical simulations of an AFI in a geometry with edges. We find that nonuniform particledensity profiles remain stable in the bulk up to the longest timescales that we can access, while the propagatingedge states persist and thermalize. These findings open the possibility of observing quantized edge transport ininteracting systems at high temperature.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Frederik Nathan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dmitry Abanin,", "Erez Berg,", "Netanel H.
