{"Nomor": 36363, "Judul": "Advanced Polymer Electrolyte with Enhanced ElectrochemicalPerformance for Lithium-Ion Batteries: Effect of Nitrile-Functionalized Ionic Liquid", "Abstrak": "High-voltage electrode materials are beneficial fordeveloping high-power-density lithium-ion batteries. The anodicvoltage stability of electrolytes is a major challenge for high-voltagelithium batteries. Herein, a polysiloxane-based solid polymer electro-lyte is fabricated by grafting ionic liquid and poly(ethylene oxide)chains ontoflexible polysiloxane backbone. An ionic liquid with astrong electron-withdrawing nitrile group and a positively chargedimidazole possesses good resistance against anodic oxidation, whichendows the solid polymer electrolyte with a wide electrochemicalwindow. The electrolyte integrates advantages of ionic liquid andpoly(ethylene oxide) exhibiting a high ionic conductivity (3.56\u00d710?4Scm?1at room temperature) and excellent resistance to dendritegrowth. In addition, both Li/LiFePO4and high-voltage Li/LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4cells with the as-prepared solid polymer electrolyteshow excellent cycling performance and superior rate capability at 30\u00b0C. Thus, the modified polysiloxane-based electrolyte is apromising electrolyte candidate for next-generation high-energy-density batteries", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Xiaoli_Zhan_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/162080"}, "Penulis": "Xiaoli Zhan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mingzhu Liu,Jiawen Zhang,Mingzhu Liu,Jianguo Lu,Qinghua Zhang,Fengqiu Chen"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "high voltage, lithium-ion batteries, solid polymer electrolyte, dendrite-free, ionic liquid", "Sumber": "ACSAppl.EnergyMater.XXXX, XXX, XXX?XXX", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Mar 2019"}
