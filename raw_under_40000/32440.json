{"Nomor": 32440, "Judul": "Development of Petroleum Geology in China: Discussion on Continuous Petroleum Accumulation", "Abstrak": "Petroleum exploration targets are extending gradually from the single conventional trap\nreservoirs to the large-scale unconventional continuous accumulations. Oil and gas reservoirs have\nbeen divided into two types based on the trapping mechanism and distribution of oil and gas: conventional single-trap reservoirs, such as the Daqing oil field in Songliao Basin and the Kela-2 gas field in\nTarim Basin; and unconventional continuous petroleum accumulation, such as Upper Paleozoic tight\ngas and Mesozoic tight oil in Ordos Basin, and Upper Triassic tight gas in Sichuan Basin. Two typical\ngeologic characteristics of continuous petroleum accumulation involve: (1) coexisting source and reservoir, petroleum pervasive throughout a large area tight reservoirs, and no obvious traps or well-defined\nwater-oil and gas contracts; (2) non-buoyancy accumulation, continuous petroleum charge, and no significant influence by buoyancy. Continuous petroleum accumulation generally have nm-scale pore\nthroats, and the diameters range of 10\u2013500 nm. The geometry and connectivity of these pore throats\nhas significant impact on the migration and distribution of oil and gas in continuous petroleum accumulation. China has numerous continuous petroleum accumulation containing various petroleum deposits, and the exploration of continuous resources is very promising. Unconventional petroleum geology will become an important new subject in petroleum geology in future, and the nano-technology will\nfunction greatly on research, exploration and development of the hydrocarbon accumulation in nano-pore-throats.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "CAINENG ZOU  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Shizheng Tao", "Zhi Yang", "), Lianhua Hou", "Xuanjun Yuan", "Rukai Zhu", "Jinhua Jia", "Songtao Wu", "Yanjie Gong", "Xiaohui Gao", "Lan Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "continuous petroleum accumulation, unconventional petroleum geology, nano-pore", "Sumber": "Journal of Earth Science, Vol. 24, No. 5, p. 796\u2013803, October 2013 ISSN 1674-487X Printed in China DOI: 10.1007/s12583-013-0373-7", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
