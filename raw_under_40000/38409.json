{"Nomor": 38409, "Judul": "Association between Consumer Practices  and Phthalate Exposure in Children and their  Parents from Slovakia", "Abstrak": "Phthalates represent endocrine disrupting chemicals, with harmful effect on the hormonal balance \nof the human body. Food is a substantial source of exposure to phthalates. The aim of study was to \ninvestigate association between phthalate exposure of children and their parents from Slovakia (children n = 51, parents n = 27) and their consumer practices. We analysed urine samples by high performance liquid  chromatography  and  tandem  mass  spectrometry  (HPLC-MS/MS)  to  determine  concentrations of  phthalate  metabolites  monoethyl  phthalate  (MEP),  monomethyl  phthalate  (MMP),  mono-n-buthyl phthalate  (MnBP),  mono-iso-buthyl  phthalate  (MiBP),  monocyclo-hexyl  phthalate  (MCHP),  mono(2-ethylhexyl)  phthalate  (MEHP),  mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl)  phthalate  (MEHHP),  mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl)  phthalate  (MEOHP),  mono(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl)  phthalate  (MECPP)  and  mono(2-carboxymethylhexyl)  phthalate  (McMHP),  mono-n-octyl  phthalate  (MnOP)  and  mono-isononyl phthalate  (MiNP).  We  observed  significantly  higher  concentrations  of  di  (2-ethylhexyl)  phthalate (DEHP) metabolites and MiBP in children in comparison with parents (p?0.05). We found statistically significant association between concentrations of some phthalates and consumption of food packed in the plastic containers, drinking of milk and strongest association was detected between consumption of sliced salami in a plastic package and concentrations of all DEHP metabolites (p?0.05). We concluded that consumption of the fat rich food stored in the plastic containers together with socioeconomic status and age could affect urinary concentration of phthalate metabolites.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Henrieta Hlisn\u00edkov\u00e1 [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Miroslava \u0160idlovsk\u00e1, Branislav Kolena, Ida Petrovi?ov\u00e1"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "biomonitoring, phthalate metabolites, consumer practices, food containers, children and their  parents from Slovakia", "Sumber": "Pol.
