{"Nomor": 38716, "Judul": "Visual Detection of Multiplex MicroRNAs Using Cationic Conjugated Polymer Materials", "Abstrak": "A simple, visual, and specific method for\nsimultaneous detection of multiplex microRNAs (miRNAs)\nhas been developed by integrating duplex-specific nuclease\n(DSN)-induced amplification with cationic conjugated polymer (CCP) materials. The probe DNA with a complementary\nsequence to target miRNA is labeled with fluorescein dye\n(FAM). Without target miRNA, the single-strand DNA probe\ncannot be digested by DSN. Upon adding CCPs, efficient\nfluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from CCP to\nFAM occurs owing to strong electrostatic interactions between\nCCP and the DNA probe. In the presence of target miRNA, the DNA probe hybridizes with target miRNA followed by digestion\nto small nucleotide fragments by DSN; meanwhile, the miRNA is released and subsequently interacts again with the probe,\nresulting in the cycled digestion of the DNA probe. In this case, weak electrostatic interactions between oligonucleotide\nfragments and CCP lead to inefficient FRET from CCP to FAM. Thus, by triggering the FRET signal from CCP to FAM,\nmiRNA can be specially detected, and the fluorescence color change based on FRET can be visualized directly with the naked eye\nunder an UV lamp. Furthermore, an energy transfer cascade can be designed using CCP and DNA probes labeled at the 5?-\nterminus with FAM and Cy3 dyes, and the multistep FRET processes offer the ability of simultaneous detection of multiplex\nmiRNAs.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Yuanyuan Zhou 1.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170199"}, "Penulis": "Yuanyuan Zhou [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jiangyan Zhang, Likun Zhao, Yingcun Li, Hui Chen, Shengliang Li,Yongqiang Cheng"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "cationic conjugated polymer, microRNA, FRET, multiplex detection, visual detection", "Sumber": "www.acsami.org", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Jun 2019"}
