{"Nomor": 32932, "Judul": "Modeling The Effect Of Water Vaporization And Salt Precipitation On Reservoir Properties Due To Carbon Dioxide Sequestration In A Depleted Gas Reservoir", "Abstrak": "Vaporization of water during both gas reservoir development and CO2 geological sequestration in saline\nformations can cause salt precipitation with rapid loss of formation porosity and permeability. Water\nvaporization and precipitation of halite around a single well from stage production to CO2 injection are\nstudied to investigate the effect on reservoir properties in a gas reservoir. This paper identifies and\nquantifies post-flood dry zones and permeability changes in depleted gas reservoir after CO2 exposure\nwith the comparison in gas production period by performing the numerical simulation with the\ncompositional simulator. Simulation results indicate that water vaporization and salt precipitation occur\nduring gas production, and can be intensified by CO2 injection. Dry supercritical CO2 injection vaporizes\nthe brine promoting brine concentration and halite precipitation. The simulation indicates a drying area\nwith a radius of 78 m around wellbore after CO2 injection. Porosity reduces with the most scope of 58%,\nand permeability can be decreased by up to 93.9% due to salt precipitation. And the injectivity is\ndamaged by 99.77% at the end of injection period based on maximum permeability reduction. Moreover,\nsix factors are investigated to conduct the influence analysis, showing that higher salinity brine, higher\ninjection rate, higher irreducible water saturation, lower initial permeability, higher temperature and\nwith capillary flow are conditions enhancing the salt precipitation due to dry CO2 injection", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "YONG TANG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ruizhi Yang, Xingmei Kang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Carbon dioxide, Reservoir, Gas reservoir", "Sumber": "Petroleum 4 (2018) 385-397 - KeAi, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2017.12.003", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Jan 2019"}
