{"Nomor": 37821, "Judul": "SIZE EFFECTS OF ELASTICMODULUS OF FCC METALS BASED ONTHE CAUCHY-BORNRULEAND NANOPLATEMODELS", "Abstrak": "In the present research, a simple quasi-continuum model, the Cauchy-Born rule\nmodel, is used to investigate the size effects of elastic modulus for fcc metals. By considering\na nanoplate model and calculating the strain energy for the nano-sized plate under tension and\nbending, the relationship between the elastic modulus and the plate thickness is found. Size effects\nof the elastic modulus are displayed by the relative differences of the elastic modulus between\nthe nano-sized plate sample and the bulk sample. By comparing the present results with those\nof others, the effectiveness of the Cauchy-Born rule model in studying the size effects of material\nproperties are shown.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jianyun Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jingru Song, Yueguang Wei"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "quasi-continuum method, Cauchy-Born rule, size effect, elastic modulus, fcc-metal", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Apr 2019"}
