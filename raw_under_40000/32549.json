However, their dental applications remain to be evaluated,\nespecially under the context of the oral microbial community. Here,\nwe examined the exposure-response of salivary bacterial community\nto two types of GMs, that is, graphene oxide (GO) and GO-silver\nnanoparticles (AgNPs). Both GO and GO-AgNPs showed lethal\ne\nff\nect against salivary bacteria in a concentration-dependent manner,\nand the antibacterial capacity of GO-AgNPs is superior to GO.\nInterestingly, the salivary bact\nerial community enhanced the\ntolerance to GMs as compared to homogeneous bacteria. High-\nthroughput sequencing revealed that both 80\n?\ng/mL GO and 20\n?\ng/\nmL GO-AgNPs signi\nfi\ncantly altered the biodiversity of salivary\nbacterialcommunity.Especially,theyincreasedtherelative\nabundance of Gram-positive bacteria compared to the untreated sample, notably\nStreptococcus\n, suggesting that the bacterial\nwall structure plays a critical role in resisting the damage of GMs. Although GMs could e\nff\nectively limit the salivary bacterial\nactivity and cause changes in bacterial community structure, they are not toxic to mammalian cell lines. We envision this study\ncould provide novel insights into the application of GMs as\n\u201c\ngreen antibiotics\n\u201d\nin nanomedicine.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yuting Shi, [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wenjun Xia", "Wenjun Xia", "Shima Liu", "Jingyang Guo", "Zhengnan Qi", "Yan Zou", "Liping Wang", "Sheng-Zhong Duan", "Yi Zhou", "Chenglie Lin", "Jiye Shi", "Lihua Wang", "Chunhai Fan", "Zisheng Tang."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "graphene oxide (GO), graphene oxide-silver nanoparticles (GO-AgNPs), saliva, microbial community", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
