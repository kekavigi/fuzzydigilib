{"Nomor": 37308, "Judul": "A microscopic simulation model for pedestrian-pedestrian and pedestrian-vehicle interactions at crosswalks", "Abstrak": "This study aims to develop a microscopic pedestrian behavior model considering various\ninteractions on pedestrian dynamics at crosswalks. Particularly, we take into account the\nevasion behavior with counter-flow pedestrians, the following behavior with leader pedestrians,\nand the collision avoidance behavior with vehicles. Aerial video data at one intersection\nin Beijing, China are extracted for model calibration. A microscopic calibration approach\nbased on maximum likelihood estimation is applied to estimate the parameters of a modified\nsocial force model. Finally, we validate step-wise speed, step-wise acceleration, step-wise\ndirection change, crossing time and lane formation phenomenon by comparing the real data\nand simulation outputs.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Manxia Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Weiliang Zeng, Peng Chen, Xuyi Wu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "pedestrian; pedestrian-vehicle ; interactions at crosswalks", "Sumber": "zeng.weiliang@g.mbox.nagoya-u.ac.jp", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Mar 2019"}
