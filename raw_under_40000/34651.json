{"Nomor": 34651, "Judul": "Multi-point Digitalization Research of Hull Plate Based on Visual  Communication of Hull Information", "Abstrak": "The surface of hull plate is mostly composed of complex and inextensible spatial surface. The bending \nprocess of it is still finished by hand, which has become one of the bottlenecks in the digitalization of hull construction. In order to realize the digital processing of hull plate, combined with visual communication and  according  to  the  requirements  of  hull  plate  forming  technology,  a  technical  scheme  based  on  PID  control  method  was  applied  to  the  hull  plate  forming.  By  applying  the  multi-point  forming  process,  large-scale  steel  plate  was  formed  in  the  small  equipment.  In  the  multi-point  digital  forming  system,  combined with the PID control method, the required shape was obtained through precise position control of the multiple basic bodies of the hull plate. The experimental results show that the multi-point forming technology can better finish the digital forming of hull plate, and it can be used for hull plate forming process after accuracy testing", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hongmin Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Hull information, visual communication, hull plate, multi-point digitalization.", "Sumber": "Department of Information Engineering Tianjin Bohai Vocational Technical College Tianjin 300222, China", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Feb 2019"}
