{"Nomor": 36353, "Judul": "Ontologies and Shape Grammars: Communication between Knowledge-Based and Generative Systems", "Abstrak": "This paper discusses information flow between knowledge-based models and\nshape grammars for generation of building designs, explaining the interaction, system\nand implementation. The benefit for using the interactive system is that the\ncomplementary properties of the two schemes are used to strengthen the overall\nprocess. Shape grammar contains rules about the geometric organization, while\nknowledge-based model supports the contextual information.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Francois Grobler [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ajla Aksamija and Hyunjoo Kim", "Ramesh Krishnamurti, Kui Yue and Casey Hickerson"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Architectural structure", "Kata Kunci": "Knowledge-Based, Generative Systems", "Sumber": "J.S.
