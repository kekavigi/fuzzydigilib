{"Nomor": 38143, "Judul": "Designing public spaces through the lively planning integrative perspective", "Abstrak": "t The current sustainability-driven urban reality is complex. Planning for such a\nmultidimensional environment is even more complex. Alternatives to traditional planning\napproaches are sought in an attempt to create liveable and lively urban public spaces. The\nlively planning approach is based on the principles of place-making, planning scales and\nwithin various planning dimensions, with the aim to design successful public spaces. This\npaper evaluates the role that lively planning integrated approach can play in creating\nsustainable, liveable and lively public spaces, by determining the scale of implementation\nand identifying the dimensions of lively planning that could be incorporated in public\nspace design and planning. The scale and dimensions of the lively planning integrative\napproach are linked to each another, and examples of elements to be incorporated in the\ndesign of a public space are included as a conclusion of this research.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "E.
