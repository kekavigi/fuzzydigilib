{"Nomor": 38347, "Judul": "Conservation and MaintenanCe as a Means of sustainable developMent - finnish perspective", "Abstrak": "The article deals with the environmental consciousness emerged from the 1970\u2019s onwards, and with subsequent change in the ideology of city planning. The focus is on the development of urban conservation methods and on the maintenance of the built environment, which have marked a decisive shift away from the CIAM theses that dominated urban thinking during half-a-century. The decision to take the existing built environment as the starting point for all actions of city planning and design has been a radical stand for a new approach, corresponding to and paralleling the idea of sustainable development that crystallized in the 1980\u2019s up to the 1992 UN Conference. Grassroots-level strategies are considered important for all actions towards a sustainable way of life. The case of Finland is studied in some detail, with the conservation atlas of the historic milieu as an example of teaching a sustainable approach to environmental planning and design.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Kaisa Broner-Bauer [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Environmental Consciousness, Urban Conservation, Sustainable Development, and Conservation Atlas of Historic Milieu.", "Sumber": "https://search.proquest.com/docview/889258249/fulltextPDF/FDE5F689D0444337PQ/13?accountid=31562", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Mei 2019"}
