{"Nomor": 37580, "Judul": "OBTAININGMULTI-AXIAL ELASTIC POTENTIALS FORRUBBER-LIKEMATERIALS VIA ANEXPLICIT, EXACT APPROACHBASED ONSPLINE INTERPOLATION", "Abstrak": "An explicit, exact approach is proposed to obtain multi-axial elastic potentials for\nisotropic rubber-like materials undergoing large incompressible deformations. By means of two\ndirect, explicit procedures, this approach reduces the problem of determining multi-axial potentials\nto that of determining one-dimensional elastic potentials. To this end, two one-dimensional\npotentials for uniaxial case and simple shear case are respectively determined via spline interpolation\nand, then, the two potentials are extended to generate a multi-axial elastic potential\nusing a novel method based on certain logarithmic invariants. Eventually, each of the multi-axial\npotentials will exactly match the finite strain data from four benchmark tests.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hao L i Yuy u Z hang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["X iao ming Wang Z he ng nan Y in He ng X iao"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "elastomers, elastic potentials, logarithmic strain, invariants, benchmark tests, spline interpolation, exact matching", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Apr 2019"}
