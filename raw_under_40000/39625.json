{"Nomor": 39625, "Judul": "PROPORTIONAL RESONANT CONTROLLER BASED DYNAMIC VOLTAGE RESTORER WITH BATTERY ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEM", "Abstrak": "The problem of power quality is greatly concerned by consumers, especially at industrial consumers. In the present modern world, most of the equipment from industrial consumers are quite sensitive to voltage sag, so it needed high power quality to guarantee the reliability of the production process. One of the custom power devices which is effective for compensating voltage sag is Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR). To mitigate the deep voltage sag, the DVR is integrated with Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) to provide the power during compensation voltage sag is proposed. A Proportional Resonant controller based an integrated DVR with BESS, which is built in the stationary reference frame, is proposed to mitigate the unbalanced and balanced voltage sag and the phase angle jump. The proposed controller in this research consists of the outer loop voltage controller which has the feedback of load voltage, the inner loop current controller which has the feedback of a capacitor current, and in additional, the feedforwards path is added to provide the instantaneous response. The proposed DVR are validated by simulation which developed in PSIM software under various voltage disturbance. The simulation result shows the proposed DVR can fully compensate the unbalanced and balanced voltage sag, deep voltage sag, phase angle jump, and fast response to track the reference voltage.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Abdul Muiz Sufianto": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/172553"}, "Penulis": "Abdul Muiz Sufianto [23217121]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
