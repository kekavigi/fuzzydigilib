{"Nomor": 34287, "Judul": "Quantitative interpretation of multiple self-potential anomaly sources by a global optimization approach", "Abstrak": "Multiple self-potential (SP) anomalies are analyzed by using a Genetic-Price Algorithm (GPA),\nwhich has been recently introduced for the inversion of SP data. The proposed approach is tested\non multiple synthetic anomalies, which are modeled by horizontal cylinders. First, a forward\nmodeling is used to analyze the resolution of such anomalies by varying all model parameters.\nThen, GPA is applied to invert synthetic multiple SP anomalies. The numerical analyses show\nthat the proposed approach is able to fully characterize the anomaly sources by providing the\ncorrect values of the model parameters as well as the number of sources, even if Gaussian\nrandom noise is added to the synthetic data. Furthermore, to show the computational efficiency\nof GPA, the results of a comparative analysis with the Very Fast Simulated Annealing algorithm\nare given. The validity of the GPA approach is confirmed by its application to three examples of\nself-potential field data from mineral exploration and groundwater investigations, which are\npresented and discussed in relation to other inversion approaches. Finally, the quantitative interpretation of multiple anomalies along a SP profile crossing the Mt. Somma-Vesuvius\nvolcano caldera (southern Italy) is provided.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Rosa Di Maio [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ester Piegari, Payal Rani, Rolando Carbonari, Eleonora Vitagliano, Leopoldo Milano"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "self-potential anomalies; statistical methods; genetic algorithms; global optimization approach", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics, S0926-9851(18)30408-7  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2019.02.004", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Feb 2019"}
