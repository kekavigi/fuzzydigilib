{"Nomor": 33360, "Judul": "Microplastic in marine organism: Environmental and toxicological effects", "Abstrak": "Microplastics are tiny ubiquitous plastic particles present in marine environments. They are not an individual\nentity, but constitute a cocktail of polymers and additives that can absorb substances from the surrounding\nenvironment, including living substances, nutrients and marine pollutants. Given their small size (< 5 ?m),\nmicroplastics can be ingested by a wide range of marine organisms with the potential to cause harms.\nMicroplastics are a growing threat for marine biota and ecosystem. For organisms, the risks associated with\nmicroplastic ingestion are not only due to the material itself, but also to its ability to absorb and concentrate\nenvironmental contaminants in seawater and subsequently transfer them through food chains. Moreover, microplastics could influence ecological processes. Recently, plastic debris are recognized as emerging pollutants\nand represent a great risk for marine biodiversity worldwide. Here, we summarize the main effects of plastics\nand microplastics on some marine organisms and ecosystem.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Eleonora Guzzetti [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Antoni Sureda.,Silvia Tejada.,Caterina Faggio"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Microplastics Ingestion Effects Pollutants Marine environments Ecosystem", "Sumber": "Environmental Toxicology and Pharmacology 64 (2018) 164\u2013171", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Jan 2019"}
