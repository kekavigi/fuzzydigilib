{"Nomor": 37374, "Judul": "Life-Saving Threads: Advances in Textile-Based Analytical Devices", "Abstrak": "Novel approaches that incorporate electrofluidic\nand microfluidic technologies are reviewed to illustrate\nthe translation of traditional enclosed structures into open and\naccessible textile based platforms. Through the utilization of\non-fiber and on-textile microfluidics, it is possible to invert the\ntypical enclosed capillary column or microfluidic \u201cchip\u201d\nplatform, to achieve surface accessible efficient separations\nand fluid handling, while maintaining a microfluidic environment.\nThe open fiber/textile based fluidics approach\nimmediately provides new possibilities to interrogate,\nmanipulate, redirect, extract, characterize, and quantify solutes\nand target species at any point in time during such processes as on-fiber electrodriven separations. This approach is\nrevolutionary in its simplicity and provides many potential advantages not otherwise afforded by the more traditional enclosed\nplatforms.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Syamak Farajikhah [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Joan M.
