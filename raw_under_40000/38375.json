{"Nomor": 38375, "Judul": "Classifying elements of a typology of gated communities", "Abstrak": "Purpose \u2013 This paper aims to classify major elements in a typology of gated communities and develop a\nframework that can be used to promote international comparison of this built form.  Design/methodology/approach \u2013 The paper draws on a survey of 77 gated housing estates in Hong\nKong and interviews with major stakeholders to develop and order a classification of elements of a typology of gated communities. Principle component analysis and regression analysis are used in conjunction with insights from 20 in-depth and about 70 open-ended face-to-face interviews.\nFindings \u2013 This paper explores Hong Kong\u2019s gated communities to evaluate the relationships between the\nfour main elements of a typology of gated communities: supply, demand, features of gated estates and\ncharacteristics of built form. It is suggested that there is a hierarchical relationship between the elements, \nsupply and demand are higher-order elements and features of gated housing and characteristics of the\nhousing stock are lower-order elements. The paper additionally highlights the impact of definitional and\nconceptual drift in key concepts, such as security, privacy, prestige and lifestyle, on developing robust\ntypologies.\nOriginality/value \u2013 The paper reviews the many and varied typologies of gated communities in the\ninternational literature, classifies the elements into four main groups and posits a hierarchical relationship\nbetween these elements. This paper proposes a robust methodology for further comparative research into\ngated communities.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Adrienne La Grange  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Urban planning, Public policy, Residential property, High-density housing, Urban design, Typology Hong Kong, Gated communities", "Sumber": "International Journal of Housing Markets and Analysis; Bingley Vol. 11, Iss. 3,  (2018): 520-540.", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Mei 2019"}
