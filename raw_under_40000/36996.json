{"Nomor": 36996, "Judul": "FOLK HOUSING REVISITED", "Abstrak": "As Fred Kniffen observed, vernacular buildings identify culture and record\nour relationships with physical and social environment. Influenced by Kniffen, twentieth-\ncentury cultural geographers used spatially correlated log homebuilding attributes as\ndiagnostics. The present study used a qualitative meta-study approach to evaluate studies\nciting such correlations in the eastern temperate forests of North America. Forty-two\nstudies involving sixty-three geographic entities and twenty-two attribute types were\nevaluated. The meta-study\u2019s findings were consistent with an Eastern Woodlands regional\nmodel described by Kniffen, Terry Jordan, and Wilbur Zelinsky. A majority of the\nspatially correlated attributes involved building materials, cited cultural and/or environmental\ninfluences to explain their findings, and cited correlations at state/province or\ncounty scales. Today, identification of building culture undoubtedly continues to offer\npotential guidance to sustainability efforts, and, although untapped, vernacular building\ncontinues to offer potential as a key diagnostic.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "JAMES S.
