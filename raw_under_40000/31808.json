The method used in this research is analytical model by using equations which are developed by Gourlay (2007) and Barrass (1981). Gourlay (2007) equation is used to determine the maximum allowed squat using bathymetry data of Sangkulirang River and draft of deep-draft vessels data. And, Barrass (1981) equation is used to determine the criteria speed designs using the known maximum allowed squat which needs bathymetry and width data of Sangkulirang River also the beam and draft of vessels data. Finally, the criteria speed design of deep-draft vessels in shallow waterway can be proposed for providing safety navigation in Sangkulirang River for large barge vessels is 9.7 knots, for large container vessels is 11.3 knots and for RoRo vessels is 17 knots. But those criteria speed designs are calculated based only on the dimensions of waterway and vessels. Therefore it needs other factor to be included into calculations such as waterway traffic and interaction between vessels for better results", "Daftar File": {"2015 TA PP YUGI PRATAMA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/142388", "2015 TA PP YUGI PRATAMA 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/142389", "2015 TA PP YUGI PRATAMA 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/142390", "2015 TA PP YUGI PRATAMA 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/142391", "2015 TA PP YUGI PRATAMA 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/142392", "2015 TA PP YUGI PRATAMA 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/142393"}, "Penulis": "YUGI PRATAMA (NIM : 15111044 )", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing :  Dr.rer.nat.
