{"Nomor": 36995, "Judul": "Building Power in Rural Hinterlands: An Ethnoarchaeological Study of Vernacular Architecture in Tigray, Ethiopia", "Abstrak": "In Tigray, Ethiopia highland farmers and noblemen used a common vernacular\narchitecture to build places of political authority and power during the last century\nof Ethiopia\u2019s feudal economy. This study contributes to the perspective that\ndomestic houses are active political locales integrated into the larger political\nlandscape. In addition, it is argued that vernacular architectural style generates\nhierarchical power in part by manipulating building strategies usually attributed\nto monumental construction. The study concludes that vernacular architecture is\nactively engaged in rendering a political aesthetic that reproduces state authority\nin rural hinterlands.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Diane E.
