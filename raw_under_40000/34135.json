{"Nomor": 34135, "Judul": "FROM SINGLE-PARTICLE EXCITATIONS TO SOUND WAVES IN A BOX-TRAPPED ATOMIC BOSE-EINSTEIN CONDENSATE", "Abstrak": "We experimentally and theoretically investigate the lowest-lying axial excitation of an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate in a cylindrical box trap. By tuning the atomic density, we observe how the nature of the mode changes from a single-particle excitation (in the low-density limit) to a sound wave (in the high-density limit). Throughout this crossover the measured mode frequency agrees with Bogoliubov theory. Using approximate low-energy models we show that the evolution of the mode frequency is directly related to the interaction-induced shape changes of the condensate and the excitation. Finally, if we create a large-amplitude excitation, and then let the system evolve freely, we observe that the mode amplitude decays nonexponentially in time; this nonlinear behavior is indicative of interactions between the elementary excitations, but remains to be quantitatively understood.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SAMUEL J.
