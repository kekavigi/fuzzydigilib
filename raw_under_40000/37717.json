{"Nomor": 37717, "Judul": "Free-text keystroke dynamics authentication for Arabic language", "Abstrak": "This study introduces an approach for user authentication using free-text keystroke dynamics which\nincorporates text in Arabic language. The Arabic language has completely different characteristics to those of English. The approach followed in this study involves the use of the keyboard\u2019s key-layout. The method extracts timing features from specific key-pairs in the typed text. Decision trees were exploited to classify each of the users\u2019 data. In parallel for comparison, support vector machines were also used for classification in association with an ant colony optimisation feature selection technique. The results obtained from this study are encouraging as low false accept rates and false reject rates were achieved in the experimentation phase. This signifies that satisfactory overall system performance was achieved by using the typing attributes in the proposed approach, while typing Arabic text.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Arwa Alsultan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Kevin Warwick, Hong Wei"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "keystroke dynamics authentication, Arabic language", "Sumber": "IET Biometrics", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Apr 2019"}
