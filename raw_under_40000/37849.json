{"Nomor": 37849, "Judul": "Exploring the intelligent art installation as a space for expansion of the conscious mind", "Abstrak": "This paper argues for the digital interactive installation artwork based on principles of complexity as an interface with the potential to evoke ekspansions in the  subjective  experience  by  confronting  the  user  with  an  idea  of  abstract thought, created through a conceptual design, and experienced through bodily\ninteraction  and  contemplative  acts  at  symbolic  levels.  The  claim  is,  that  ideas presented  through  good  artworks  based  on  the  coalision  of  science  and  technology   can   potentially   create   a   synthesis   between   ideas   inspired   by   the philosophies and empiricisms of the physical-material world view, but also of a higher, spiritual dimension, in which new possibilities of knowledge are poten-\ntially to be found. The article accepts the thesis of cognition being the cause of evolution, rather than evolution of man being the cause of cognition", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Kathrine Elizabeth Anker [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "artificial intelligence artificial life consciousness contemplation of art complexity evolution spirituality virtual information networks", "Sumber": "Technoetic Arts: A Journal of Speculative Research. 2009, Vol. 6 Issue 3, p251-258. 8p", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Apr 2019"}
