The design used was quasiexperimental pre-test intervention\u2013posttest with control group. The sample used included 86 children aged 10 and 11 years, 54 experimental and 32 control, distributed in 4 groups. Before and after the program, 2 assessment methods were  administered:  7  verbal  and  figural  tasks  from Torrance\u2019s Tests of Creative Thinking and direct judgment by experts who assessed a creative product. Theprogram consisted of a weekly 2-hr intervention session throughout the school year. The program\u2019s activities were intended to stimulate verbal, graphic\u2013figural, constructive,  and  dramatic  creativity.  Results  of  the analyses of variance suggest a positive effect of the intervention,  as  the  experimental  participants  significantly  increased  their  verbal  creativity  (originality)and  graphic\u2013figural  creativity  (resistance  to  premature closure, originality, elaboration, creative performance). The program produced a significantly greater change in the experimental participants who showed a low level of creativity before the intervention. The effects of the program were similar in boys and girls", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Maite Garaigordobil [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Maite Garaigordobil"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Creativity, child, verbal", "Sumber": "Creativity Research Journal 2006, Vol. 18, No. 3, 329\u2013345", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Apr 2019"}
