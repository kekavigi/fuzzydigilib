{"Nomor": 34103, "Judul": "3-D studies of MT data in the Central Polish Basin: Influence of inversion parameters, model space and transfer function selection", "Abstrak": "3-D inversion of geophysical data has become a practical, commonly used tool in the interpretation of\nmagnetotelluric (MT) data. However, 3-D inversion is a non-linear and non-unique task and requires adopting\nadditional assumptions. In this paper, we analyze the influence of selection of inversion parameters in the case\nof previously published, real model for Pomerania region (Poland). This zone is a regional scale 2-D structure,\nwhich locally becomes 3-D. The analyzed model was accomplished by inversion of full impedance and tippers\nfrom 31 MT stations with the period range from 10 s to 10,000 s. The inversion parameters were chosen to\nprovide the best possible agreement of the model with well-known geophysical and geophysical data.\nThe purpose of the presented work is to determine how the change of some inversion parameters influences\npreviously obtained model, and therefore we check which structure features remain in spite of the change of\nthe implied parameters. A number of tests were performed employing an implementation of the freely available\nModEM inversion package. These included the choice of an appropriate initial model and a model covariances\nevaluation as a means to control smoothness between adjoining model areas. Additionally, we compared the\nmodels calculated from all transfer functions (impedances and tippers) and from subsets (only tippers and\noff-diagonal components of the impedance tensor and tippers). Moreover, the tests with the model coordinate\nsystem rotation were performed.\nOur analysis has shown that the values of covariance matrix coefficients have an evident effect on the results.\nHowever, the multiple use of the covariance matrix with small coefficients gives a similar result as its single\nuse with higher coefficients. The initial model and the selection of the transfer function for inversion can significantly\nchange the model. However, changing the orientation of the coordinate system from geographic to the\none that is aligned with a regional strike direction does not cause noticeable changes in the solution obtained.\nIt can be only noted that for the rotated coordinate system the obtained model becomes closer to the model of\na 2-D regional structure.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Katarzyna Slezak  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Waldemar Jozwiak, Krzysztof Nowozynski, Szymon Orynski, Heinrich Brasse"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Magnetotellurics 3-D modeling Covariance Numerical solutions", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 161 (2019) 26\u201336, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.11.008", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Feb 2019"}
