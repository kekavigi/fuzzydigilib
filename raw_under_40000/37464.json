{"Nomor": 37464, "Judul": "Conversion of MoS2to a Ternary MoS2?xSexAlloy for High-Performance Sodium-Ion Batteries", "Abstrak": "MoS2has attracted tremendous attention as an anode forNa-ion batteries (NIBs) owing to its high specific capacity and layeredgraphite-like structure. Herein, MoS2is converted to a ternary MoS2?xSexalloy through the selenizing process in order to boost the electrochemicalperformance for Na-ion batteries. Conversion of MoS2to MoS2?xSexexpands interlayer spacing, improves electronic conductivity, and createsmore defects. The expanded interlayer spacing decreases Na+diffusionresistance and facilitates Na+fast transfer. The integrated graphene as aconductive network offers effective pathway for electron migration andmaintains structural stability of electrodes during cycles. The ternaryMoS1.2Se0.8/graphene (MoS1.2Se0.8/G) electrode demonstrates an ex-tremely high reversible capacity of 509 mA h g?1after 200 cycles at 0.1Ag?1(capacity retention of 109%) as an anode for sodium-ion batteries.Even at 2 A g?1and after 700 cycles, the MoS1.2Se0.8/G electrode also displays a relatively high reversible capacity of 178 mA hg?1. Full cells assembled with Na3V2(PO4)2F3cathodes and MoS1.2Se0.8/G anodes reveal high charge/discharge capacities. Thiswork demonstrates that the ternary MoS2?xSexalloy could be a potential anode material for Na-ion storage.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Yaqiong_Zhang,_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164518"}, "Penulis": "Yaqiong Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Huachao Tao,Shaolin Du,Xuelin Yang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "sodium ion batteries, anode, MoS2, MoS2?xSex, selenizing", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
