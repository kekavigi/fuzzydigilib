{"Nomor": 35264, "Judul": "The impact of temperature on the transformation of illicit drug biomarkers in wastewater", "Abstrak": "Temperature is one of the key factors, influencing the transformation kinetics of organic chemicals. In the context\nof wastewater-based epidemiology, however, temperature differences among sewer catchments and within the\nsame catchment (due to, e.g., seasonal variations) have been neglected to date as a factor influencing the estimation of illicit drug consumption. In this study, we assessed the influence of temperature on the transformation of\nbiomarkers in wastewater and its ensuing implications on the back-calculation of chemical consumption rate in\nurban catchments using the example of selected illicit drugs. Literature data, obtained in laboratory-scale experiments, on the stability of drug biomarkers in untreated wastewater at trace levels was systematically reviewed,\nand transformation rates obtained at different temperatures were collected.\nArrhenius-based equations were fitted to empirical data and identified to describe the transformation of selected\ncocaine and morphine biomarkers at applicability temperature range (from 2\u20139 \u00b0C to 30\u201331 \u00b0C), with estimated\nexponential Arrhenius coefficients between 1.04 and 1.18. These empirically-derived relationships were used to\nassess the influence of temperature on the transformation of drug biomarkers during in-sewer transport and its\neffect on the back-calculation of drug consumption rate in hypothetical urban catchment scenario simulations.\nUp to 4-fold increase in removal efficiency was estimated when wastewater temperature increased from 15 \u00b0C\nto 25 \u00b0C. Findings from this study can help reducing the uncertainty intrinsic to wastewater-based epidemiology\nstudies, and will be beneficial in comparing chemical consumption estimates from different catchments\nworldwide.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Pedram Ramin [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Fabio Polesel.,Andreas Libonati Brock.,Benedek Gy.
