{"Nomor": 33322, "Judul": "Adsorption mechanisms of five bisphenol analogues on PVC microplastics", "Abstrak": "Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics are easily embrittled and decomposed to microplastics in an aquatic environment. The plasticizers such as bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol S (BPS) and their analogues might be released and\nadsorbed by the PVC microplastics causing consequential pollution to the ecosystem. Herein, a systematic\nstudy was performed to determine the adsorption mechanisms of five bisphenol analogues (BPA, BPS, BPF,\nBPB and BPAF) on PVC microplastics. The maximum adsorption efficiency reached 0.19 \u00b1 0.02 mg\u00b7g?1 (BPA),\n0.15 \u00b1 0.01 mg\u00b7g?1 (BPS), 0.16 \u00b1 0.01 mg\u00b7g?1 (BPF), 0.22 \u00b1 0.01 mg\u00b7g?1 (BPB), and 0.24 \u00b1 0.02 mg\u00b7g?1\n(BPAF) at PVC dosage of 1.5 g\u00b7L?1 . The kinetics study shows that the adsorption processes can be divided into\nthree stages including external mass transport, intraparticle diffusion and dynamic equilibrium. The isotherm\nmodeling shows a better fit of the adsorption results to the Freundlich isotherm compared to the Langmuir\nmodel. The thermodynamic study indicates the adsorption of all bisphenols as exothermic processes. Furthermore, the adsorption mechanisms of bisphenols were explicated intensively, with respect to hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic forces, and noncovalent bonds. A positive effect of hydrophobic interactions was identified\nfor bisphenols adsorption on PVC microplastics, but an obvious inhibition by electrostatic repulsions was revealed for BPF due to its ionization in the neutral solution. In addition, noncovalent bonds (hydrogen and halogen\nbonds) may promote the adsorption of bisphenols on PVC microplastics. Finally, the desorption and competitive\nadsorption of five bisphenol analogues on the microplastics were provided together with a perspective for future\nworks.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Pengfei Wu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zongwei Cai., Hangbiao Jin .,Yuanyuan Tang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Microplastics Bisphenol analogues Adsorption mechanisms Kinetics Isotherms Thermodynamics", "Sumber": "Science of the Total Environment 650 (2019) 671\u2013678", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi \u00a0\n                                     Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Jan 2019"}
