{"Nomor": 36631, "Judul": "Kinetic Modeling Of Cement Slurry Synthesized With Henna Extract In Oil Well Acidizing Treatments", "Abstrak": "Acidizing treatment in petroleum reservoirs is a short-term and viable strategy to preserve the\nproductivity of a well. There is a major concern for the degradation of cement sheath integrity,\nleading to poor zonal isolation and environmental issues. Therefore, it is essential to understand\nhow the cement behaves when attacked by hydrochloric acid. In this study, a cement slurry by\nincorporation of the Henna extract, as an environmentally friendly cement additive, was synthesized as a potential solution to solve this problem. The characteristics of the treated cement slurry\nwere compared with a reference slurry (w/c \u00bc 0.44) which is composed of only cement and water.\nA kinetic study was carried out to evaluate the adsorption behavior of the cement slurries exposed\nto an acid solution with 0.1 M HCl in a range of 25 to 55 C conditions. The features of the cement\nslurries were evaluated by multiple analytical techniques such as XRD, FTIR, TG, and DSC analysis.\nFrom the experimental data, it is concluded that the second-order Lagergren kinetic model revealed\nto be the best in describing kinetic isotherms taken, because the margin between experimental and\ncalculated values was minor for this model. The results of the characterization and HCl interaction\nkinetic studies underlined the prominent protective role of Henna extract-modified cement slurry\nin the enhancement of the cement resistance against acid attack and utilization in environmentally\nfavorable oil well acidizing treatments", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Amir Hossein Aghajafari  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Seyed Reza Shadizadeh", "Khalil Shahbazi", "Hadi Tabandehjou"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Oil well cement, Henna extract Solid/solution interaction, Environment protection, Kinetic modeling", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 2, Pages 196-207 (June  2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Mar 2019"}
