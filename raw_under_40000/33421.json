{"Nomor": 33421, "Judul": "Towards an IOT Based System for Detection and Monitoring of Microplastics in Aquatic Environments", "Abstrak": "Monitoring presence of micro-plastics in the ocean\nand fresh waters is an important research topic due to a need\nto preserve marine ecosystem. Microplastics represent\nthreats to living organisms, producing harmful effects,\nultimately also having an impact on humans through the\nfood-chain. Use of laboratory-based and in situ techniques do\nhelp in investigating density and scale of this kind of\npollutants. The in-situ sensing techniques are gaining\npopularity due to automation and continuous availability.\nThese techniques though need an accurate hardware and\nefficient computing model to achieve desired success. Here,\nwe propose an IoT based system called 'SmartIC' using\nspecialized sensors and intelligent computing tools,\nspecifically designed for in-situ monitoring of microplastics\nin natural aquatic environments. This paper is focused on\nsystem architecture, monitoring process and outline of\nexperimental work. The initial research provides very\npromising results. A further course of the investigation with\nvalidation will be conducted in future to establish the\nproposed system completely.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zenon Chaczko [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Anup Kale., Jos\u00e9 Juan Santana-Rodr\u00edguez., Carmen Paz Su\u00e1rez-Araujo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Microplastics, IoT, In-Situ Sensing,Multimodality", "Sumber": "INES 2018 \u2022 22nd IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Engineering Systems \u2022 June 21-23, 2018 \u2022 Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Jan 2019"}
