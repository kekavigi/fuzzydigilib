{"Nomor": 34312, "Judul": "FIRST OBSERVATION OF OPTICAL ACTIVITY IN HYPER-RAYLEIGH SCATTERING", "Abstrak": "Chiral nano- or metamaterials and surfaces enable striking photonic properties, such as negative\nrefractive index and superchiral light, driving promising applications in novel optical components,\nnanorobotics, and enhanced chiral molecular interactions with light. In characterizing chirality, although\nnonlinear chiroptical techniques are typically much more sensitive than their linear optical counterparts,\nseparating true chirality from anisotropy is a major challenge. Here, we report the first observation of\noptical activity in second-harmonic hyper-Rayleigh scattering (HRS). We demonstrate the effect in a 3D\nisotropic suspension of Ag nanohelices in water. The effect is 5 orders of magnitude stronger than linear\noptical activity and is well pronounced above the multiphoton luminescence background. Because of its\nsensitivity, isotropic environment, and straightforward experimental geometry, HRS optical activity\nconstitutes a fundamental experimental breakthrough in chiral photonics for media including nanomaterials, metamaterials, and chemical molecules.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "J.
