{"Nomor": 37246, "Judul": "Fluvial Facies Reservoir Productivity Prediction Method Based On Principal Component Analysis And Artificial Neural Network", "Abstrak": "It is difficult to forecast the well productivity because of the complexity of vertical and horizontal\ndevelopments in fluvial facies reservoir. This paper proposes a method based on Principal\nComponent Analysis and Artificial Neural Network to predict well productivity of fluvial facies\nreservoir. The method summarizes the statistical reservoir factors and engineering factors that\naffect the well productivity, extracts information by applying the principal component analysis\nmethod and approximates arbitrary functions of the neural network to realize an accurate and\nefficient prediction on the fluvial facies reservoir well productivity. This method provides an\neffective way for forecasting the productivity of fluvial facies reservoir which is affected by multifactors and complex mechanism. The study result shows that this method is a practical, effective,\naccurate and indirect productivity forecast method and is suitable for field application.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Pengyu Gao  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Chong Jiang", "Qin Huang", "Hui Cai", "Zhifeng Luo", "Meijia"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Fluvial facies reservoir, Productivity forecast, Principal component analysis, Artificial neural network", "Sumber": "Petroleum,Volume 2, Issue 1, Page 49-53 (March 2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Mar 2019"}
