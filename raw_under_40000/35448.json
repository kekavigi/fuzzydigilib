{"Nomor": 35448, "Judul": "The Aesthetics of Information: A Bit of Beauty", "Abstrak": "On the basis of the cyclical time model of consciousness, the aesthetics of arts and music is discussed in terms of the smallest unit of information, the bit. Previously, the chronological advancement of music was discussed in terms of an increase in randomness, which then led to a higher order. The musical beauty of a bit is considered in light of randomness and order being interconnected through a cyclical looping process, as seen in consciousness. On the other hand, the progress of the arts can be studied in terms of the interplay between physical and the mental aspects. It is argued that the artistry of a single bit may be associated with an attachment between the reality of the bit and the semantic meaning, or the conscious awareness of choice. The relevance of the proposed model of beauty in music and the arts to Heidegger\u2019s argument on existence and Wittgenstein\u2019s analysis of language is also discussed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Daegene Song [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Information, Beauty, Cyclical time, Language, Music , Arts", "Sumber": "NeuroQuantology | March 2018 | Volume 16 | Issue 3  | Page 56-60 | doi: 10.14704/nq.2018.16.3.1116", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Feb 2019"}
