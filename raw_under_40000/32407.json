A squall line system\nthat occurred on 23 April 2007 over southern China was used to investigate the impacts of the data assimilation frequency\nof radar data on analyses and forecasts. A three-dimensional variational system was used to assimilate radial velocity data,\nand a cloud analysis system was used for reflectivity assimilation with a 2-h assimilation window covering the initial stage of\nthe squall line. Two operators of radar reflectivity for cloud analyses corresponding to single- and double-moment schemes\nwere used. In this study, we examined the sensitivity of assimilation frequency using 10-, 20-, 30-, and 60-min assimilation\nintervals. The results showed that analysis fields were not consistent with model dynamics and microphysics in general;\nthus, model states, including dynamic and microphysical variables, required approximately 20 min to reach a new balance\nafter data assimilation in all experiments. Moreover, a 20-min data assimilation interval generally produced better forecasts\nfor both single- and double-moment schemes in terms of equitable threat and bias scores. We conclude that a higher data\nassimilation frequency can produce a more intense cold pool and rear inflow jets but does not necessarily lead to a better\nforecast.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yujie PAN [196315152014092001]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mingjun WANG"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Astronomi", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Knowledge", "Kata Kunci": "cloud analysis, radar data assimilation, data assimilation interval", "Sumber": "ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, VOL. 36, FEBRUARY 2019, 160\u2013", "Staf Input/Edit": "pustaka bosscha", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
