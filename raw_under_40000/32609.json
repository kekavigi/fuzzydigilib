However, the heating mechanism\nunderlying the application has been rarely elaborated. Herein,\nwe used a template-assisted approach to formulate a poly-\n?\n-\ncaprolactone nanocarrier system integrated with magnetic\nnanoparticles and gold nanorods for a controlled drug\ndelivery. With the incorporated magnetic nanoparticles, the\nsystem included e\nffi\ncient cellular internalization via magnetic\ndriving. Meanwhile, it demonstrated a near-infrared-light-responsive on/o\nff\ndrug release behavior by photothermal heating\noriginated from the gold nanorods. The nanostructure of the carrier system was examined intact upon the photothermal\nheating. A further investigation on the release mechanism showed that the photothermal heating con\nfi\nned temperature elevation\nto the region around gold nanorods, which only induced a localized structural change of the polymer matrix that triggered the\nrelease of the vicinity cargo. The work introduces a feasibly formulated multifunctional drug delivery system, and also, it unveils\nthe controlled release mechanism of the photothermal heating that only triggers a localized structural disruption of the carrier\nmatrix.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zhen Yang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Guoliang He", "Dong Cai", "Zhifeng Ren"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Physics", "Kata Kunci": "photothermal, drug delivery, controlled release, poly- ? -caprolactone, template-assisted nanofabrication", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
