{"Nomor": 36482, "Judul": "A New Method Of Deliverability Prediction By Steady Point In Gas Wells", "Abstrak": "Calculating the absolute open flow potential timely and investigating production capacity so as to\nadjust working system of production wells is one of main means to effectively recovery gas reservoirs during intermediate and late development stage. In order to obtain the open flow potential\nof gas wells accurately, a new method which utilized a single steady point was proposed in this\nresearch, which was based on deliverability formula of a gas well in pseudo-steady state flow with\npseudo-pressure form. The influence on factor B in binomial productivity equation caused by the\nchanged permeability was taken into consideration. According to the stable production data,\nreservoir permeability K can be determined by iterative method firstly, and the coefficient A, B in\nbinomial productivity equation can be calculated with the open flow potential subsequently. It\nillustrated clearly by a practical example that the new method was suitable for gas wells especially\nwhen the producing pressure drop is large. Additionally, the error between the open flow potential\nvalue and interpretation result from the multi-point test was small, which proved it to be more\nsimple, economic and effective than the common one", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Aiting Mu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Qiguo Liu", "Honghua Tao", "Zhiyang Du", "Ke Li", "Kun Xiao"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Gas wells, Single steady point, Deliverability equation, Open flow potential, Single-point test, Well test analysis", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 2, Pages 183-188 (June  2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Mar 2019"}
