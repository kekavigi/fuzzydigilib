{"Nomor": 32389, "Judul": "A review on exergy analysis of aerospace power systems", "Abstrak": "Exergy, an integration of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, enriches the traditional analysis method\nbased on energy conservation. It can effectively reveal the causes of the irreversibilities and inefficiencies of the\nthermodynamic processes, which provides a convenient approach for engineers to design and optimize the\ncomponents and systems. This paper firstly introduces the development history of exergy and the fundamental\nmathematics behind exergy analysis in general. Next, the application status of exergy analysis method in turbojet/\nturbofan engines, scramjet engine, aircraft system and multidisciplinary design optimization is represented\nin detail. At the end of this review, we put forward the practical needs for further development of\nexergy analysis and conclude that this method has wide application prospect in the field of aerospace power\nsystems.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zeyu Dong [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dapeng Li., Zhenguo Wang., Mingbo Sun"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "Reading & use of other information media", "Kata Kunci": "Exergy, Exergy analysis method, Aerospace power systems, Multidisciplinary design optimization", "Sumber": "Acta Astronautica 152 (2018) 486\u2013495", "Staf Input/Edit": "Erlin Marliana Effendi \u00a0\n                                     Erlin Marliana Effendi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
