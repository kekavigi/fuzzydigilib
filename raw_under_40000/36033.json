{"Nomor": 36033, "Judul": "Intermediate Water on Calcium Phosphate Minerals: Its Origin andRole in Crystal Growth", "Abstrak": "Water molecules are known to play crucial roles both in theformation and biological function of materials. Herein, we show the presenceof\u201cintermediate water\u201don an inorganic solid material, hydroxyapatite.In vitroexperiments revealed that Mg substitution of apatite significantly enriched theamount of intermediate water, possibly due to the proton transfer to ahydrogen-bonded network of water around HPO42?on divalent-cation-deficient apatite surfaces. The intermediate water formation related to amarkedly suppressed protein adsorption on apatite. Analysis of bone apatitessuggested that the intermediate water on minerals could play crucial roles in regulating crystal growth.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Masahiro_Okada_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/161467"}, "Penulis": "Masahiro Okada [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Emilio Satoshi Hara,Daisuke Kobayashi,Shoki Kai,Keiko Ogura,Masaru Tanaka,Takuya Matsumoto"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "bone apatite mineral growth, water hydrogen-bonded network, intermediate water, differential scanning calorimetry,infrared spectroscopy", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
