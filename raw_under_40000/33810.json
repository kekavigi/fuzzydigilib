{"Nomor": 33810, "Judul": "Leveraging the Strengths of Dedicated, Gruan and Conventional Radiosondes for Satellite Hyperspectral Geophysical Sounding Assessment", "Abstrak": "The atmospheric temperature and water vapour profile products, derived from the hyperspectral cross-track infrared sounder/advanced technology microwave sounder (CrIS/ATMS) on board the Suomi national polar orbiting partnership (S-NPP) satellite and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) on board MetOP-B satellite, were assessed using radiosonde data as the target. This is achieved by leveraging the strengths of satellite synchronized dedicated, Global Reference Upper Air Network (GRUAN), and conventional radiosonde observations (RAOBs) in the analysis of satellite-radiosonde collocation data, compiled through the NOAA sounding Products Validation System (NPROVS). One of the results found in the study is water vapour profiles of both the NOAA Unique Combined Atmospheric Processing System (NUCAPS) and EUMETSAT IASI L2 products are comparable to or even better than numerical model prediction (NWP) outputs, when dedicated ship RAOBs were used as the benchmark.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Bomin Sun [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Anthony Reale, Michael Pettey, Ryan Smith, Nicholas Nalli, and Lihang Zhou"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Satellite broadcasting , Ocean temperature , Atmospheric measurements , US Government agencies , Marine vehicles , Land surface temperature , Temperature measurement", "Sumber": "IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, DOI: 10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8517992", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Jan 2019"}
