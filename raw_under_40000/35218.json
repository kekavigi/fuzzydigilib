Three ortho-corrected RapidEye satellite images at 5-m spatial resolution and cloud cover of??89%) than that of the conventional unsupervised ISODATA method (>?83%) as river water and vegetation could be differentiated more accurately using this new method. The unchanged area was greater for river water than for vegetation and bare alluvium. These results indicated that habitat distribution changed spatially and temporally, especially for fluvial habitats, while the composition of habitat types was preserved in the middle reaches of the Tagliamento River. This method can be used to continuously and accurately monitor the large-scale spatiotemporal dynamics of habitat structures.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP SHIENA OKADA 1": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/159220"}, "Penulis": "Shiena Okada [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Rajendra Khanal, Chihiro Yoshimura, Oliver Saavedra, Masahiro Ryo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Habitat turnover,  Spatio-temporal dynamics, Land cover classification,  Digital number distribution,  Pixel value, Tagliamento River", "Sumber": "Landscape and Ecological Engineering  January 2019, Volume 15, Issue 1, pp 63\u201374 | Cite as", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Feb 2019"}
