By drawing on the ways Abstract Expressionism was\nconstructed and promoted within the rigid national perspective of 1950s\u2019 US cultural\npolicy and reacted against in Britain and Europe on similarly nationalistic terms, I show\nhow the circulatory exchange of cultural flows reveals a more co-produced understanding\nof these  histories.

In  doing  so  I  draw\nparticular  attention  to  the  period  from  the  early  1950s  to  the  1960s  and  the  artistic\nactivity and critical writing associated with New York City and the Cornish coastal town\nof St Ives.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Andy Morris [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Atlantic, Abstract Expressionism, New York, St Ives, cultural geographies", "Sumber": "Social & Cultural Geography, Vol. 6, No. 3, June 2005", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Feb 2019"}
