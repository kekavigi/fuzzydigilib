{"Nomor": 33314, "Judul": "Application of image contours to three aspects of image processing : compression, shape recognition and stereopsis", "Abstrak": "Image processing comprises two distinct areas of\nresearch, namely image analysis and image compression.\nHowever, the thrust of research towards the analysis of\ndigital images and towards their efficient coding has been\npursued almost independently. Both areas are of vital\nimportance. The prospect of building \u2018machines that see\u2019\nfor industrial inspection, medical imaging etc. is an exciting\none indeed. Also the necessity to develop efficient\ncoding techniques to reduce the number of data required\nfor image storage and transmission is clear.\nIn both image analysis and image compression it is\nnecessary to derive a representation from the pixel data.\nAlthough basic filtering and template matching\napproaches in image analysis operate directly upon the\nimage intensity values, more complex tasks such as\nunconstrained recognition must operate on higher-level\nprimitive descriptions. Exactly what these primitives\nshould comprise is still an area of current research. Features\nsuch as edges, corners and zero crossings of the\nsecond derivative have been proposed Marr [2].
