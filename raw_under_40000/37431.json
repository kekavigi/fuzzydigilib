{"Nomor": 37431, "Judul": "Inflammation clues in STING protein structure", "Abstrak": "The branch of the immune system called\ninnate immunity has a pivotal role in\nhost defence by recognizing general\nhallmarks of disease-causing agents. The\nintracellular protein STING, a transmembrane\nprotein usually located on an organelle called\nthe endoplasmic reticulum, is a key regulator\nof this type of immune response1. Writing in\nNature, Shang et al.2 and Zhang et al.3 report\nfull-length structures of STING, including\nSTING in complex with the kinase protein\nTBK1, which initiates the downstream signalling\npathway that is triggered on STING\nactivation.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ANDREA ABLASSER [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "protein structure", "Sumber": "Springer", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Mar 2019"}
