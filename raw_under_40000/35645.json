{"Nomor": 35645, "Judul": "Description of damage process in fractured rocks", "Abstrak": "This paper is focused on analysis of the damage process in rock that contains some pre-existing fractures. The\nmethodology employs an enhanced embedded discontinuity approach, which is extended here to account for the\npresence of multiple sets of joints. The approach can be easily implemented in standard FE codes and the results\nare virtually independent of mesh size/alignment. This is in view of incorporation of a \u2018characteristic dimension\u2019\nwhich explicitly depends on discretization of the domain. It is demonstrated that the approach is capable of\npredicting complex fracture modes associated with formation and propagation of new cracks within the region\nthat contains the pre-existing flaws.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "H.
