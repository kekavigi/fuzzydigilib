{"Nomor": 32820, "Judul": "Research on biomass energy and environment from the past to the future: A bibliometric analysis", "Abstrak": "The development and utilization of biomass energy can help to change the ways of energy production and consumption and establish a sustainable energy system that can effectively promote the development of the national\neconomy and strengthen the protection of the environment. Here,we perform a bibliometric analysis of 9514 literature reports in the Web of Science Core Collection searched with the key words \u201cBiomass energy\u201d and \u201cEnvironment*\u201d date from 1998 to 2017; hot topics in the research and development of biomass energy utilization, as\nwell as the status and development trends of biomass energy utilization and the environment, were analyzed\nbased on content analysis and bibliometrics. The interaction between biomass energy and the environment\nbegan to become a major concern as the research progressively deepened. This work is of great significance for\nthe development and utilization of biomass energy to put forward specific suggestions and strategies based onthe analysis and demonstration of relationships and interactions between biomass energy utilization and environment. It is also useful to researchers for selecting the future research topics.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Guozhu Mao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ning Huang.,a , Lu Chen., Hongmei Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Biomass energy Environment Bibliometrics", "Sumber": "Science of the Total Environment 635 (2018) 1081\u20131090", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Jan 2019"}
