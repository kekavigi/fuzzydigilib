{"Nomor": 35522, "Judul": "Preparation and characterization of silver nanoparticles homogenous thin films", "Abstrak": "The wet chemical method by metal salt reduction has been widely used to synthesize nanoparticles. Accordingly\nthe silver nitrate used as silver precursor and sodium borohydrate as reduction agent. The silver nanoparticles\nwere characterized by different characterization techniques including UV\u2013VIS spectrometry, Transmission\nelectron microscope (TEM), and Zeta potential technique. Thin films of the colloidal solution were fabricated\nusing direct precipitation technique on ITO glass, silicon substrate and commercial glass substrate and characterized by imaging technique. The absorption peak of the silver nanoparticles colloidal solution was around\n400 nm. The TEM images indicate that the silver nanoparticles had spherical shape and their sizes were from 10\nto 17 nm. The particle size of the silver nanoparticles was confirmed by Zeta potential technique. The imaging\ntechnique indicated that the homogeneous distribution of the colloidal silver solution thin film on the silicon\nsubstrate was stronger than the ITO glass and inhomogeneous film was emerged on the commercial glass.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Maroof A.
