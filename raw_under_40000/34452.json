{"Nomor": 34452, "Judul": "Evaluation Of Dolomite Reservoirs In The Longwangmiao Formation, Lower Cambrian In Northern Sichuan Basin, China", "Abstrak": "With the extended petroleum exploration of the carbonate reservoir in the Longwangmiao Formation, Lower Cambrian in Sichuan basin, looking for a new favorable exploration area is the\nprimary task in current exploration. This paper focusing on the dolomite reservoir in the Longwangmiao Formation in the Northern Sichuan basin, will evaluate the reservoir conditions,\nincluding reservoir lithology, reservoir spaces, physical properties and other basic characteristics.\nCombined with sedimentary environment study and diagenesis analysis, the genetic mechanism of\nLongwangmiao reservoir in study area will be discussed. It indicates that the reservoir rocks of\nLongwangmiao Formation in the study area are composed of dolarenite and crystalline dolomite,\nand the main reservoir spaces are intergranular dissolved pores, intragranular dissolved pores and\nintercrystalline dissolved pores. However, most of dissolved pores have been filled with bitumen,\nwhich lead to the reservoir properties very poor, both the porosity and permeability are worse than\nthat of central Sichuan basin, so the reservoir in the Longwangmiao Formation in the Northern\nSichuan basin is low-porosity and low-permeability reservoir. During the Early Cambrian Longwangmiao period, the study was near the old-land, and the energy of sea water was not enough to\ndeposit many grain shoals, which cause the sediments are small with lots of quartz and muds.\nMoreover, because lacking of large scale karstification in the late diagenesis, there isn't much\ndissolved pores and vugs develop in the Longwangmiao Formation. Some Intergranular dissolved\npores and intercrystalline dissolved pores formed by the early atmosphere water dissolved exist as\nsome reservoir spaces, but most of them have been filled with bitumen, which was residual when\nthe ancient oil reservoir transformed. Above factors cause the Longwangmiao Formation in the\nNorthern Sichuan basin become not a very favorable reservoir in Sichuan basin", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "XUEFEI YANG  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yaping Wang", "Xingzhi Wang", "Deming Zeng", "Longbo Xu", "Zisang Huang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Reservoir evaluation, Dolomites, Longwangmiao Formation, Northern Sichuan basin", "Sumber": "Petroleum-KeAi, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2017.06.003", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Feb 2019"}
