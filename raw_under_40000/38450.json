{"Nomor": 38450, "Judul": "OPTIMIZATION OF AIRFOIL OF WING IN GROUND EFFECT USING GENETIC ALGORITHM", "Abstrak": "One of methods that are being used widely lately for optimization need is Genetic\nAlgorithm or GA. This method adapted the mechanism of biology mechanism involving\nnatural selection. With many advantages it has, numerical simulation of an airfoil with\nground influence is attempted to be coupled with Genetic Algorithm to get better lift\nalteration.\nStudy focused on developing the program of Genetic Algorithm and Aerodynamic with\nground effect condition. Coupling of both programs giving a good result that the shape of\nairfoil would be changes to provide better properties of aerodynamic. Consideration of\ncoupled program will involve objective function, parameter setting, constraints, and the\nperformance of computer. The whole components contribute to generate appropriate\nsolution of optimization in aerodynamic domain as well.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Muhammad Ilham Adhynugraha": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/169726", "PUSTAKA Muhammad Ilham Adhynugraha": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/169733"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Ilham Adhynugraha [23606009]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Lavi Rizki Zuhal"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "genetic algorithms, ground effect, lift maximization, numerical simulation", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Mei 2019"}
