{"Nomor": 32921, "Judul": "Some practical guidance for petroleum migration modeling", "Abstrak": "Petroleum migration modeling is widely used to assess petroleum charge and fluid phase risk in exploration and\nappraisal. There are three principal migration methods: Darcy flow, invasion percolation, and flowpath (or ray\ntracing). Each method relies on different assumptions and yields different outcomes. This paper analyzes the\nstrengths and weaknesses of these methods as they are implemented in PetroMod\u00ae\n, providing a practical guide as\nto how and when to apply each migration method. Flowpath is the most simplistic and computationally fastest\nmethod and should only be applied when a quick screening is required. Invasion percolation delivers satisfactory\nresults for most geological settings, from structurally and stratigraphically simple to complex, but does not\nconsider expulsion from the source rock properly. Darcy flow is the preferred method for unconventional resource assessments and supports maximum downward migration. A traditional modeling approach is to use two\nmethods, applying Darcy flow to tight rocks and flowpath to highly permeable rocks. Another combined method\ncan be used in such a way that Darcy flow is applied to the source rock and invasion percolation to the carrier\nand reservoir beds. The latter seems to deliver best results in most geological settings, while also providing more\nrealistic results of secondary migration losses.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "FRIEDEMANN BAUR [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Barry Katz"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Petroleum geology, Petroleum Basin modeling, Migration Darcy, Flowpath Invasion percolation", "Sumber": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2018.03.003 Received 24 May 2017; Received in revised form 2 March 2018; Accepted 5 March 2018", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Jan 2019"}
