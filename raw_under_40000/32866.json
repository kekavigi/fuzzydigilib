{"Nomor": 32866, "Judul": "COMPLEX ENERGY LANDSCAPES IN SPIKED-TENSOR AND SIMPLE GLASSY MODELS: RUGGEDNESS, ARRANGEMENTS OF LOCAL MINIMA, AND PHASE TRANSITIONS", "Abstrak": "We study rough high-dimensional landscapes in which an increasingly stronger preference for a given\nconfiguration emerges. Such energy landscapes arise in glass physics and inference. In particular, we focus\non random Gaussian functions and on the spiked-tensor model and generalizations.We thoroughly analyze\nthe statistical properties of the corresponding landscapes and characterize the associated geometrical phase transitions. In order to perform our study, we develop a framework based on the Kac-Rice method that allows us to compute the complexity of the landscape, i.e., the logarithm of the typical number of stationary points and their Hessian. This approach generalizes the one used to compute rigorously the annealed complexity of mean-field glass models. We discuss its advantages with respect to previous frameworks, in particular, the thermodynamical replica method, which is shown to lead to partially incorrect predictions.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "VALENTINA ROS [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["GERARD BEN AROUS,", "GIULIO BIROLI,", "AND CHIARA CAMMAROTA"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Physics", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "AMERICAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari \u00a0\n                                     Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Jan 2019"}
