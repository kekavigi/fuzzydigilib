{"Nomor": 38428, "Judul": "Stochastic fluctuations and quasipattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems with anomalous transport", "Abstrak": "Many approaches to modeling reaction-diffusion systems with anomalous transport rely on deterministic\nequations which ignore fluctuations arising due to finite particle numbers. Starting from an individual-based model we use a generating-functional approach to derive a Gaussian approximation for this intrinsic noise in subdiffusive systems. This results in corrections to the deterministic fractional reaction-diffusion equations. Using this analytical approach, we study the onset of noise-driven quasipatterns in reaction-subdiffusion systems. We find that subdiffusion can be conducive to the formation of both deterministic and stochastic patterns. Our analysis shows that the combination of subdiffusion and intrinsic stochasticity can reduce the threshold ratio of the effective diffusion coefficients required for pattern formation to a greater degree than either effect on its own.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Joseph W.
