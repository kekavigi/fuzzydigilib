{"Nomor": 33108, "Judul": "Effect Of Reservoir Heterogeneity On Air Injection Performance In A Light Oil Reservoir", "Abstrak": "Air injection is a good option to development light oil reservoir. As well-known that, reservoir heterogeneity has great effect for various EOR processes. This also applies to air injection. However, oil recovery\nmechanisms and physical processes for air injection in heterogeneous reservoir with dip angle are still\nnot well understood. The reported setting of reservoir heterogeneous for physical model or simulation\nmodel of air injection only simply uses different-layer permeability of porous media. In practice, reservoir heterogeneity follows the principle of geostatistics. How much of contrast in permeability actually\nchallenges the air injection in light oil reservoir? This should be investigated by using layered porous\nmedial settings of the classical Dykstra-Parsons style. Unfortunately, there has been no work addressing\nthis issue for air injection in light oil reservoir. In this paper, Reservoir heterogeneity is quantified based\non the use of different reservoir permeability distribution according to classical Dykstra-Parsons coefficients method. The aim of this work is to investigate the effect of reservoir heterogeneity on physical\nprocess and production performance of air injection in light oil reservoir through numerical reservoir\nsimulation approach. The basic model is calibrated based on previous study. Total eleven pseudo compounders are included in this model and ten complexity of reactions are proposed to achieve the reaction\nscheme. Results show that oil recovery factor is decreased with the increasing of reservoir heterogeneity\nboth for air and N2 injection from updip location, which is against the working behavior of air injection\nfrom updip location. Reservoir heterogeneity sometimes can act as positive effect to improve sweep\nefficiency as well as enhance production performance for air injection. High O2 content air injection can\nbenefit oil recovery factor, also lead to early O2 breakthrough in heterogeneous reservoir. Well-type does\nnot show great effect on production performance for air injection in extreme heterogeneous reservoir.\nWhile adopting horizontal producer is favourable to promote production performance for air injection in\nhomogenous reservoir.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "HU JIA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Air injection, Light oil, Heterogeneity Dykstra-parsons coefficients, Enhanced oil recover,y Recovery mechanism", "Sumber": "Petroleum 4 (2018) 15-24 - KeAi, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2017.10.006", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Jan 2019"}
