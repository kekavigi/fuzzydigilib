With the effective superimposed resonance effect from electron-deficient carbonyls and electron-rich nitrogen atom, both emitters realizesignificant TADF characteristics with small?ESTs of 0.18 and 0.19 eV,respectively. And, molecular relaxations were dramatically suppressed for bothemitters because of their conjugated structure. In the devices, 3-PhQAD realizessuperior performance with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of19.1% and a narrow full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 44 nm, whereas amaximum EQE of 18.7% and an extremely narrow FWHM of 34 nm arerealized for 7-PhQAD. These superior results reveal that apart from nitrogenand boron-aromatic systems, QAD framework can also act as a TADF matrix with effective resonance effect, and QADderivatives are ideal candidates to develop TADF emitters with narrow FWHMs for practical applications", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Xing_Li_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164758"}, "Penulis": "Xing Li [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yi-Zhong Shi, Kai Wang, Ming Zhang, Cai-Jun Zheng,Dian-Ming Sun,Gao-Le Dai,Xiao-Chun Fan,De-Qi Wang,Wei Liu,Yan-Qing Li,Jia Yu,Xue-Mei Ou,Chihaya Adachi,Xiao-Hong Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "thermally activated delayedfluorescence, resonance effect, narrow full width at half-maximum,organic light-emitting diodes, rigid framework", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
