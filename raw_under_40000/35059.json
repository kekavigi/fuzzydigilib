{"Nomor": 35059, "Judul": "Real-time 3-D space numerical shake prediction for earthquake early warning", "Abstrak": "In earthquake early warning systems, real-time shake prediction through wave propagation simulation is a promising approach. Compared with traditional methods, it does not suffer from the inaccurate estimation of source parameters. For computation efficiency, wave direction is assumed to propagate on the 2-D surface of the earth in these methods. In fact, since the seismic wave propagates in the 3-D sphere of the earth, the 2-D space modeling of wave direction results in inaccurate wave estimation. In this paper, we propose a 3-D space numerical shake prediction method, which simulates the wave propagation in 3-D space using radiative transfer theory, and incorporate data assimilation technique to estimate the distribution of wave energy. 2011 Tohoku earthquake is studied as an example to show the validity of the proposed model. 2-D space model and 3-D space model are compared in this article, and the prediction results show that numerical shake prediction based on 3-D space model can estimate the real-time ground motion precisely, and overprediction is alleviated when using 3-D space model.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP TIANYUN WANG 1": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/158667"}, "Penulis": "Tianyun Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xing Jin, Yandan Huang, Yongxiang Wei"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Real-time numerical shake prediction,  3-D space model,  Radiative transfer theory,  Data assimilation", "Sumber": "Earthquake Science  December 2017, Volume 30, Issue 5\u20136, pp 269\u2013281 | Cite as", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Feb 2019"}
