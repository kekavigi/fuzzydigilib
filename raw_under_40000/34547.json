{"Nomor": 34547, "Judul": "Optimized Polymer Flooding Projects Via Combination Of Experimental Design And Reservoir Simulation", "Abstrak": "The conventional approach for an EOR process is to compare the reservoir properties with those of\nsuccessful worldwide projects. However, some proper cases may be neglected due to the lack of\nreliable data. A combination of experimental design and reservoir simulation is an alternative\napproach. In this work, the fractional factorial design suggests some numerical experiments which\ntheir results are analyzed by statistical inference. After determination of the main effects and interactions, the most important parameters of polymer flooding are studied by ANOVA method and\nPareto and Tornado charts. Analysis of main effects shows that the oil viscosity, connate water\nsaturation and the horizontal permeability are the 3 deciding factors in oil production. The proposed methodology can help to select the good candidate reservoirs for polymer flooding", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ali Bengar [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Siyamak Moradi", "Mostafa Ganjeh-Ghazvini", "Amin Shokrollahi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Polymer flooding, Fractional factorial design, Reservoir simulation, P-value, ANOVA", "Sumber": "Petroleum, Volume 3, Issue 4, Pages 461-469 (December 2017)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Feb 2019"}
