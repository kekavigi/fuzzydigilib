{"Nomor": 34208, "Judul": "History as a Piece of Art", "Abstrak": "The purpose of this article is to analyze the situation that developed in the modern philosophy \nof  history  and  historiography.  An  attempt  was  made  to  overcome  the  so-\ncalled  \"end  of  \nhistory\"  crisis.  The  main  argument  of  thinkers  who  adhere  to  the  position  of  history  \nimpossibility was the comparison or even the identification of the historical text with works of \nart.  In  the  authors'  opinion,  such  a  problematization,  although  quite  serious  and  appropriate,  \ndoes  not  so  much  hamper  the  possibility  of  history  and\n  historical  research  as  it  gives  new  \nopportunities in understanding the problem of history. The main conclusion of this article is to \nrecognize the crisis of the form of history or historical research characteristic of the classical \nhistory philosophy appl\nied in the XIXth and partly, albeit with varying success, in the XXth \ncentury.  The  narrative\n-artistic  form  is  a  symptom  of  the  end  of  history  (neither  as  a  real  \nhistorical  process,  nor  as  the  way  of  its  description),  but  as  a  turn  and  an  event  in  the  \ndevel\nopment of the history paradigm and the principle of historicism. An event that, like other \nevents, has its own historical boundaries and limits.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Natal'ya Anatol'evna Tereshchenko [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Samson Aleksandrovich Liberman"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "History, A bsence of history, T he end of history, H istorical narrative, A  work .", "Sumber": "Journal of History Culture and Art Research", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Feb 2019"}
