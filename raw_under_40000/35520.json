{"Nomor": 35520, "Judul": "Studying the variation of eddy diffusivity on the behavior of advectiondiffusion equation", "Abstrak": "In this work, the advection-diffusion equation was solved in two dimensions to calculate the normalized\ncrosswind integrated concentration by Laplace technique. Considering that the wind speed is constant and we\nhave two models of the vertical eddy diffusivity, one depends on downwind distance and the other model\ndepends on vertical distance. A comparison between our proposed two models, Gaussian, previous work and\nobserved data measured at Copenhagen, Denmark, have been carried out. One finds that there is a good\nagreement between predicted (2) model and the observed concentrations than predicted (1), Gaussian and\nprevious work.\nFrom the statistical technique, one finds that all models are inside a factor of two with observed data.\nRegarding to Normalized mean square error (NMSE) and Fraction Bais (FB), proposed model (2) is performance\nwell with observed data than the predicted (1), Gaussian and previous work in unstable condition.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Khaled Sadek Mohamed Essa [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Aziz Nazer Mina, Hany Saleh Hamdy, Fawzia Mubarak, Ayman Ali khalifa"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Diffusion Equation Separation of variables Gaussian model Laplace technique Eddy diffusivity", "Sumber": "NRIAG Journal of Astronomy and Geophysics 7 (2018) 10\u201314, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrjag.2018.02.003", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Feb 2019"}
