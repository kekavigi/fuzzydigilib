{"Nomor": 36175, "Judul": "Cross-Flow Analysis Of Injection Wells In A Multilayered ReservoirPresenting decision tree for best mixing rules and Z-factor correlations and introducing novel correlation for binary mixtures", "Abstrak": "The significance of gas compressibility factor in petroleum engineering encourages the researchers\nto employ the most accurate and precise methods for estimation of this factor. Commonly,\nempirical correlations due to their simplicity have been referred more than other approaches for\nprediction of Z-factor. There is no clear and reliable report to address an appropriate combination of\ncorrelation and mixing rule for each type of gas. In the present study, combination of several\nempirical correlations and mixing rules is examined and a decision tree is constructed to suggest\nbest combination for each gas system. For this reason, 2329 experimental data were used for\nanalysis. According to the results, LelandeMueller mixing rule/Sanjari and Lay correlation is the\nbest combination for sour and natural gas. Also, Van NesseAbbot mixing rule/HalleYarborough\ncorrelation, StewarteBurkhardteVoo mixing rule/Heidarian correlation and SattereCampbell\nmixing rule/Papay correlation are the most appropriate combination for gas condensate, binary and\nternary mixtures respectively.\nFor binary mixtures, a robust and novel empirical correlation was developed based on Kay\nmixing rule to estimate Z-factor. The results employed how good the new correlation is in agreement with the experimental data with significant R-squared 0.9843.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mohamad Mohamadi-Baghmolaei [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Reza Azin", "Zeinab Zarei", "Shahriar Osfouri"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Z-factor, Mixing rules, Empirical correlations, Binary and ternary mixtures", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 3, Pages 289-295 (September  2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Mar 2019"}
