{"Nomor": 32179, "Judul": "DEFORMATION ANALYSIS IN THE EAST NUSA TENGGARA AND BANDA ISLANDS BASED ON GPS OBSERVATION FROM 2010-2015", "Abstrak": "East Nusa Tenggara (NTT) and Banda Islands are located at the collision zone between Australian Plate and Eurasian Plate. The result from this activity caused significant tectonic activities around East Nusa Tenggara (NTT) to Banda Islands which can generate earthquake activity. GPS Observation can be applied for deformation monitoring in this research area. The data used to understand the tectonic activities characteristics in East Nusa Tenggara and Banda Islands are continuous GPS observation data from 2010-2015 and IGS data from 9 sites around the research area from 2010-2015. The GPS data are processed using GAMIT 10.5 software to derive geocentric coordinates, geodetic coordinates, and standard deviation. The coordinates are transformed into topocentric coordinates and in Sundaland block reference (ITRF2000). The velocity of displacement in this area are at range of 1.72 \u00b1 0.01 cm/year to 7.73 \u00b1 0.00 cm/year in Sundaland block reference, move north-northeastward. The strains in this research area are dominated by shortening component in north-south direction with maximum shortening happened in back-arc basin zone.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Giovanni Cynthia P [15112045]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Irwan Meilano, ST., M.Sc.", "Dr. Endra Gunawan, S.T., M.Sc."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Geodesi dan Geomatika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Ilmu dan Teknologi Kebumian", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "collision, eastern Indonesia, velocity, strain, deformation", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "6 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Des 2018"}
