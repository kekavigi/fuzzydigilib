Suite of logs from four wells were provided, but only three wells were used\nfor the analysis because well 3 does not have density log. Petrophysical properties were calculated from the logs\nusing the respective equations and pseudo shear wave velocity was estimated from the P-wave velocity. The\nresult of the rock physics analysis carried out using crossplots of acoustic impedance against P-wave velocity\ncoloured with gamma ray log was able to separate the lithology into sand and shale both within the wells and the\nreservoirs of interest with the aid of the relevant rock physics models. Vp/Vs against acoustic impedance\ncrossplots coloured with density log indicated the pore fluid in the wells and mapped sand bodies to be water\nand oil. Two mathematical models for predicting elastic parameters in the absence of some necessary logs were\ndeveloped and these models can be used in the Niger Delta and in other sedimentary basins of the world.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "S.J.
