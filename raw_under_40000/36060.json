{"Nomor": 36060, "Judul": "Dynamic aperture limitation in e + e ? colliders due to synchrotron radiation in quadrupoles", "Abstrak": "In a lepton storage ring of very high energy (e.g., in the e\u00fee? Higgs factory) synchrotron radiation from\nquadrupoles constrains transverse dynamic aperture even in the absence of any magnetic nonlinearities.\nThis was observed in tracking for LEP and the Future Circular e\u00fee? Collider (FCC-ee). Here we describe a new mechanism of instability created by modulation of the particle energy at the double betatron frequency by synchrotron radiation in the quadrupoles. Energy modulation varies transverse focusing strength at the same frequency and creates a parametric resonance of the betatron oscillations with unusual properties. It occurs at arbitrary betatron frequency (the resonant detuning is always zero) and the magnitude of the parameter modulation of the betatron oscillation (strength of the resonance driving term) depends on the oscillation amplitude. Equilibrium between the radiation damping and the resonant excitation gives the boundary of the stable motion. Starting from 6d equations of motion we derive and solve the relevant differential equation describing the resonance, and show good agreement between analytical results and numerical simulation.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "A.
