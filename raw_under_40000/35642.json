{"Nomor": 35642, "Judul": "Operando DRIFTS and DFT Study of Propane Dehydrogenation over Solid- and Liquid-Supported GaxPty Catalysts", "Abstrak": "Supported catalytically active liquid metal solutions (SCALMS) represent a class of catalytic materials that have only recently been developed, but have already proven to be highly active, e.g., for dehydrogenation reactions. Previous studies attributed the catalytic activity to isolated noble metal atoms at the surface of a liquid and inert Ga matrix....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Tanja Bauer [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sven Maisel, Dominik Blaumeiser, Julia Vecchietti, Nicola Taccardi, Peter Wasserscheid, Adrian Bonivardi, Andreas Go?rling, Jo?rg Libuda"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "SCALMS, dehydrogenation, DRIFTS, operando, DFT", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Feb 2019"}
