The peripheral draft tube aeration was performed by air injection through\n(1) a continuous orifice and (2) a series of discrete orifices along the surface of the draft tube. The simulations were performed when the system is operating in the turbine mode. Peripheral aeration was\nmore effective for the achieved dissolved oxygen level and the oxygen dissolution efficiency. The mean\ndissolved oxygen concentration and the dissolution efficiency inside the draft tube were predicted to\nbe 1.8 mg/l and 80% using the continuous or discrete peripheral aeration and 1.4 mg/l and 25% using\nthe central aeration. A mean value ranging from 1.0 mg/l to 2.0 mg/l was considered to be sufficient\nfor aerobic bacteria to treat the wastewater. Aeration resulted in a minor penalty on the power generation, while it provided a significant reduction in the flow-induced vibration. The central aeration was\nmore effective in reducing the amplitude of pressure fluctuations and yielded more stable turbine operating conditions.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Cosan Daskiran [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Bashar Attiya.,Muhannad Altimemy.,I-Han Liu.,Alparslan Oztekin"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Large eddy simulation Central aeration Peripheral aeration Oxygen dissolution Pressure fluctuations Wastewater treatment", "Sumber": "International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer 131 (2019) 1052\u20131063", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Mar 2019"}
