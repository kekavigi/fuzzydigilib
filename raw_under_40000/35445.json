{"Nomor": 35445, "Judul": "Impact of Wet Treatments on the Electrical Performance of Ge0.9Sn0.1-Based p?MOS Capacitors", "Abstrak": "We have investigated the impact of different\nwet treatments on the electrical performances of germanium?\ntin (GeSn)-based p-MOS capacitors with 10% Sn. Atomic\nforce microscopy (AFM) showed the presence of Sn droplets\nfor the degreased Ge0.9Sn0.1 surface, which were removed by\nHCl, HF, and HF:HCl treatments. On the other hand,\n(NH4)2S and NH4OH treatments were not fully able to\nremove these droplets. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy\n(XPS) measurements confirmed AFM results and highlighted\nthe efficiency of HF, HCl, and HF:HCl treatments in\nremoving Ge and Sn native oxide, which was not the case\nwith (NH4)2S and NH4OH. Nevertheless, XPS showed a reoxidation of ...", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mohamed Aymen Mahjoub [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Thibault Haffner, Se?bastien Labau, Etienne Eustache, Joris Aubin, Jean-Michel Hartmann, Ge?rard Ghibaudo, Bernard Pelissier, Franck Bassani, and Bassem Salem"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "germanium?tin (GeSn), wet treatments, depth profile, MOS capacitor, C?V measurements, pAR-XPS", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Feb 2019"}
