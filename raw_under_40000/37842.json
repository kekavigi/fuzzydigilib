{"Nomor": 37842, "Judul": "CONSTITUTIVE MODELINGOFROLLED SHAPE MEMORY ALLOY SHEETS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT PRE-TEXTUREAND ANISOTROPICHARDENING", "Abstrak": "The drawing or rolling process endows polycrystal shape memory alloy with a crystallographic\ntexture, which can result in macroscopic anisotropy. The main purpose of this work is\nto develop a constitutive model to predict the thermomechanical behavior of shape memory alloy\nsheets, which accounts for the crystallographic texture. The total macroscopic strain is decomposed\ninto elastic strain and macro-transformation strain under isothermal condition. Considering\nthe transformation strain in local grains and the orientation distribution function of crystallographic\ntexture, the macro-transformation strain and the effective elastic modulus of textured\npolycrystal shape memory alloy are developed by using tensor expressions. The kinetic equation\nis established to calculate the volume fraction of the martensite transformation under given stress.\nFurthermore, the Hill\u2019s quadratic model is developed for anisotropic transformation hardening of\ntextured SMA sheets. All the calculation results are in good agreement with experimental data,\nwhich show that the present model can accurately describe the macro-anisotropic behaviors of\ntextured shape memory alloy sheets.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yuping Zhu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yuanbing Wang, Guansuo Dui"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "shape memory alloy, constitutive model, transformation yield function, texture, anisotropic hardening", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect: Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 27, No. 2, April, 2014 ISSN 0894", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Apr 2019"}
