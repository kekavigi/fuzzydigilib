{"Nomor": 35435, "Judul": "Facile Surface Multi-Functionalization of Biomedical Catheters with Dual-Microcrystalline Broad-Spectrum Antibacterial Drugs and Antifouling Poly(ethylene glycol) for Effective Inhibition of Bacterial Infections", "Abstrak": "With the development of biomedical materials, the widespread use of\nimplantable medical devices such as biomedical catheters has saved lives and improved\ntherapeutic outcomes in the clinic. Biomedical catheters (BCs) have the ability to\nconnect the body inside and outside and are widely used in clinical sites for fluid\ndischarging, blood indwelling, mechanical ventilating, and so on. However, catheterrelated\ninfections (CRIs) are common nosocomial infections with high morbidity\nand mortality. The pathogens in the urinary tract, blood, and lung tissue carried by\nBCs may be the direct cause of CRIs, and the bacterial biofilm on the surface of BCs\nprovides a notable source of persistent diseases....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Manman Yu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xuejia Ding, Yiwen Zhu, Shuangmei Wu, Xiaokang Ding, Yang Li, Bingran Yu, Fu-Jian Xu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "microcrystalline drugs, infection, antibacterial, antifouling, multifunctionalization", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Feb 2019"}
