{"Nomor": 37762, "Judul": "Creative Aspirations or Pipe Dreams? Toward Understanding Creative Mortification in Children and Adolescents", "Abstrak": "What experiences influence the development of creativity in children and ado-\nlescents? One experience is the mortification of creative aspirations. Creative\nmortification (CM) refers to the loss of one\u2019s willingness to pursue a particular\ncreative aspiration following a negative performance outcome. The purpose of\nthis article is to introduce an empirically testable model of CM. Specifically, the\nmodel highlights how CM can result from interpreting a negative performance\noutcome through the lens of internal attributions, fixed ability beliefs, and the\nexperience of shame. The model further posits that young people\u2019s level of aspi-\nrational commitment, the feedback they receive, and their sociocultural context\ncan moderate their interpretations and experiences of negative performance out-\ncomes and CM.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ronald A.
