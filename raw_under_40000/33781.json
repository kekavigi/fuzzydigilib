{"Nomor": 33781, "Judul": "IMPACT OF TURBULENCE ON FLYING INSECTS IN TETHERED AND FREE FLIGHT: HIGH-RESOLUTION NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS", "Abstrak": "Flapping insects are remarkably agile fliers, adapted to a highly turbulent environment.\nWe present a series of high-resolution numerical simulations of a bumblebee interacting\nwith turbulent inflow. We consider both tethered and free flight, the latter with all six\ndegrees of freedom coupled to the Navier-Stokes equations. To this end, we vary the\ncharacteristics of the turbulent inflow, either changing the turbulence intensity or the\nspectral distribution of turbulent kinetic energy. Active control is excluded in order to\nquantify the passive response real animals exhibit during their reaction time delay, before\nthe wing beat can be adapted. Modifying the turbulence intensity shows no significant\nimpact on the cycle-averaged aerodynamical forces, moments, and power, compared to\nlaminar inflow conditions. The fluctuations of aerodynamic observables, however, significantly\ngrow with increasing turbulence intensity. Changing the integral scale of turbulent\nperturbations, while keeping the turbulence intensity fixed, shows that the fluctuation level\nof forces and moments is significantly reduced if the integral scale is smaller than the wing\nlength. Our study shows that the scale-dependent energy distribution in the surrounding\nturbulent flow is a relevant factor conditioning how flying insects control their body\norientation.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "THOMAS ENGELS    [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["DMITRY KOLOMENSKIY,", "KAI SCHNEIDER,", "MARIE FARGE.", "FRITZ-OLAF LEHMANN,", "AND J\u00d6RN SESTERHENN"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS 4, 013103 (2019);  \u00a92019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Jan 2019"}
