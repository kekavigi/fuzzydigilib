But that day, mission controllers at the European Space Agency (ESA) realized\nthey had a problem: a piece of space debris was hurtling uncontrollably towards the \u20ac140-million\n(US$162-million) satellite, which monitors ice on the planet.\nAs engineers tracked the paths of both objects, the chances of a collision slowly increased \u2014 forcing mission controllers to take action. On 9 July, ESA fired the thrusters on CryoSat-2 to boost it into a higher orbit.\nJust 50 minutes later, the debris rocketed past at 4.1 kilometres a second.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ALEXANDRA WITZE [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Astronomi", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Space", "Sumber": "NATURE | VOL 561 | 6 SEPTEMBER 2018", "Staf Input/Edit": "pustaka bosscha", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Des 2018"}
