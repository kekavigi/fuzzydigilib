{"Nomor": 39044, "Judul": "A General Bioinspired, Metals-Based Synergic Cross-Linking Strategy toward Mechanically Enhanced Materials", "Abstrak": "Creating lightweight engineering materials\ncombining high strength and great toughness remains a\nsignificant challenge. Despite possessing-enhanced strength\nand stiffness, bioinspired/polymeric materials usually suffer\nfrom clearly reduced extensibility and toughness when\ncompared to corresponding bulk polymer materials. Herein,\ninspired by tiny amounts of various inorganic impurities for\nmechanical improvement in natural materials, we present a\nversatile and effective metal ion (Mn+\n)-based synergic crosslinking (MSC) strategy incorporating eight types of metal\nions into material bulks that can drastically enhance the\ntensile strength (?24.1?70.8%), toughness (?18.6?\n110.1%), modulus (?21.6?66.7%), and hardness (?6.4?176.5%) of multiple types of pristine materials (from hydrophilic\nto hydrophobic and from unary to binary). More importantly, we also explore the primarily elastic?plastic deformation\nmechanism and brittle fracture behavior (indentation strain of >5%) of the synergic cross-linked graphene oxide (Syn-GO)\npaper by means of in situ nanoindentation SEM. The MSC strategy for mechanically enhanced integration can be readily\nattributed to the formation of the complicated metals-based cross-linking/complex networks in the interfaces and\nintermolecules between functional groups of materials and various metal ions that give rise to efficient energy dissipation.\nThis work suggests a promising MSC strategy for designing advanced materials with outstanding mechanical properties by\nadding low amounts (<1.0 wt %) of synergic metal ions serving as synergic ion-bonding cross-linkers", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Ke Chen 1.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170900"}, "Penulis": "Ke Chen [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jin Ding, Shuhao Zhang, Xuke Tang, Yonghai Yue,  Lin Guo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": ": bioinspired, synergic cross-linking, metal ions, mechanical properties", "Sumber": "www.acsnano.org  DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.6b07932 ACS Nano 2017, 11, 2835?2845", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Jun 2019"}
