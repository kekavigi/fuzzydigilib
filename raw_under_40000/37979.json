{"Nomor": 37979, "Judul": "New Ideas On The Tectonic Of The Kurveleshi Anticlinal Belt In Albania, And The Perspective For Exploration In Its Subthrust", "Abstrak": "The external thrustbelt of Albania consists of some tectonic zones (Ionian, Kruja and Krasta-Cukali\nzones), that are westward overthrust, with a large amplitude (50e100 km), above the Apulian\nplatform and South Adriatic Basin. The relative movement of the Adriatico-Apulian sub-plate\nbetween, the Euro Asiatic and African plates during from the Mesozoic to the Tertiary period,\nmainly controlled the tectonic evolution of the Albanides. The Ionian zone consists of anticline\nbelts (Berati, Kurveleshi and Cika), that are overthrust toward the west with an amplitude about\n20e30 km Their overthrustings was realized through regional sliding evaporitic horizons, which\ncaused the masking of folded structures in the subthrust, with the perspective plays.\nThe Kurveleshi anticlinal belt represents a mega-anticlinal with a length of 210 km and a width\nof about 20 km, and it is characterized by anticline structures with heterogeneous dimensions,\npredominantly those of great dimensions and linear type. The overthrusting of the anticline units\nhas a local character, and it is more developed in the Kurveleshi anticlinal belt. Its magnitude is\nabout 8e10 km. As a result of these overthrusts, imbrication and duplex styles are formed, leadind\nto the masking of the subthrust complex with structures of large interest (e.g. Delvina, Karbunara,\netc.) where two oil fields have been dioscovered beneath the Mali Gjere anticline (Delvina oil\nfield) and the Kremenara anticline (Karbunara oil field). Backthrust faults phenomena are secondary and they taken place in the post-collision stage. Generally they are easterward thrust faults\nof structural units with an amplitude of 5e10 km. The Kurveleshi anticlinal belt, based on tectonic\nfeatures, is divided into two parts: The southern part, from Qafa Sevaster in the north down to\nGreece to the south. and northern part, from Qafa Sevaster in the south up to the end of the PatosVerbas structure.\nIn the southern part these features predominate: The anticline structures are large in size, and\noverthrust with a large amplitude (8e10 km) westward. The evaporitic diapirs have erupted\nthrough local faults of the anticline structures of the Kurveleshi anticlinal belt (Mali Gjere, Kurveleshi and Fterra anticlines). These eruptions (Delvina, Picar-Kapariel-Bashaj, etc.) have helped in\nthe overthrusting of these structural units. It must be mentioned that the backthrusting is also\naffected by the diapir action. Moreover, vertical diapir occur, in the center of the structures like\nNavarica. In the northern part, the anticline structures are generally small to medium in size. Only\nthe Patos-Verbas anticline is larger in size. In the Kurveleshi anticlinal belt the Ballsh and Visoka\noilfields have developed. The eastern flank of the Shushica synclinal belt apears folded, and the\ncarbonate anticline structures have developed. Existing oil fields include the Gorisht-Kocul, CakranMoallaj-Kreshpan and Amonica. These oil fields shoud continue towards the north (under the", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "TELO VELAJ [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Albania, Kurveleshi anticlinal belt, Ionian zone, Evaporite, Overthrust, Oil fields, Evaporitic tectonics, Subthrust, Upthrust", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 4, Pages 269-288 (December  2015)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Mei 2019"}
