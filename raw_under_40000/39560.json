{"Nomor": 39560, "Judul": "The numerical modeling of frequency domain scalar wave equation based on the rhombus stencil", "Abstrak": "Frequency domain numerical modeling is the basis of frequency domain full waveform inversion. The accuracy\nof forward modeling seriously influences the result of inversion. In this paper, we develope a new method for\nfrequency domain scalar wave equation to improve numerical simulation accuracy. The new method uses a\nrhombus stencil to approximate the Laplacian term and uses the weighted average of the difference scheme stencil points to approximate the mass acceleration term. Compared with the conventional stencil and the optimal\nsquare stencil, the numerical dispersion analysis shows that the new rhombus stencil can significantly decrease\nthe grid points of per wavelength and reduce the numerical dispersion. Accuracy analysis demonstrates that the\nresults of the new rhombus stencil are in best agreement with the analytical solutions relative to the other stencils in frequency domain and time domain. Two numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe new rhombus stencil for frequency domain scalar wave equation.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP AMAN LI 1": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/172359"}, "Penulis": "Aman Li  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hong Liu, Yuxin Yuan, Ting Hu, Xiaona Cui"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Numerical modeling Frequency domain Scalar wave Rhombus stencil", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 166 (2019) 42\u201356, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2019.05.002", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Jun 2019"}
