{"Nomor": 34909, "Judul": "Greg Woodard's Art of Bird Sculpture: Wood, Bronze & Clay", "Abstrak": "Greg Woodard's sculpted birds leap out from the medium, a mere second from flight. While falconer and sculptor Robinette, a friend of the artist's, gives some step-by-step instruction, this is not a book for amateur sculptors--there is no handholding on tool use or medium. The text is limited, but it does divulge Woodard's methodology. The sample carvings illustrate special technique, and it is here that the photos become mixed in quality (e.g., closeups are fuzzy). This is especially disappointing because Woodard's skill is in his detail work. Elsewhere, the photos are superb, and the gallery of birds is stunning. This beautiful book is recommended for larger collections.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "KAREN ELLIS [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Sculpture, wood, bronze, clay", "Sumber": "Library Journal. 6/1/2006, Vol. 131 Issue 10, p148-150. 2p", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos \u00a0\n                                     Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Feb 2019"}
