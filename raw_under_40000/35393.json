{"Nomor": 35393, "Judul": "New spectral-induced polarization measurement with low cost and high efficiency", "Abstrak": "Spectral induced polarization (SIP) measurement requires synchronous current acquisition and realtimetransmission\ndevices or precise phase-measuring apparatus. To carry out SIP investigations in the\nabsence of these auxiliary devices, a new SIP measurement has been developed in this research. The\nnew method uses high-accuracy phase-calculation technology based on all-phase spectrum analysis\n(APSA) to obtain the initial phase of the emission current and uses time information recorded in the\nfile header of the voltage data file and the \u2018Frequency-Time Table\u2019 of the emission current to calculate\nthe current phase information at any given moment. The phase-calculation method for the voltage\ndata was the same as that used for the current initial phase. Subsequently, the phase of the complex\nresistivity was obtained by subtracting the current phase from the voltage phase, and the amplitude\nwas obtained by normalization. Simulation tests showed that the algorithm was superior for absolute\nphase measurement compared with other spectrum analysis methods and confirmed that the accuracy\nof the new method was equal to that of the measurement that collects voltage and current synchronously.\nIndoor and field tests showed that the new APSA-based SIP method can successfully measure\nthe complex resistivity without a synchronous current- or phase-measuring device. Moreover, this\nmethod reduces the requirement for synchronization of the transmitter and receiver.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ming Deng  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Shuang-chao Ge, Bin Li, Kai Chen, Xin-yu Shi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "SIP Data acquisition Data processing Parameter estima", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 159 (2018) 697\u2013706, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.09.030", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Feb 2019"}
