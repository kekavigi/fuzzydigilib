{"Nomor": 32931, "Judul": "Laboratory Study On Efficiency Of Three Calcium Carbonate Scale Inhibitors In The Presence Of Eor Chemicals", "Abstrak": "Chemical flooding has been widely used in the oil industry since the 1980s for enhanced oil recovery\n(EOR) process. Previous studies have shown that the effectiveness of calcium carbonate scale inhibitors is\naffected by many factors, such as water composition, system pressure, temperature, production rates, pH\netc. The breakthrough of the EOR chemicals in the production well could also affect scale formation\nprocess and interfere with the scale treatment program as well. However, the studies on the impacts of\ninjected EOR chemicals to scale inhibitor performances are very limited. This paper presents the\ncomprehensive laboratory study on the impacts of the EOR chemicals on CaCO3 scale formation and\nprevention using static bottle and dynamic tube blocking methods. The EOR chemicals used in this study\nare a combination of surfactants and polymers. Three different types of inhibitors were evaluated: triphosphonate, penta-phosphonate, and polyacrylate based chemicals. Inhibition (%) from the bottle test\nand minimum effective dose (MED) based on the tube blocking method were determined for each inhibitor at 160 F. Scale precipitates from the bottle tests were also characterized for morphology and\npolymorphs using environmental scanning electron (ESEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques.\nResults suggest that the performance of scale inhibitors could be substantially affected by the EOR\nchemicals. In dynamic tube blocking tests, the MED values of inhibitors were increased roughly 10 times\nwith the EOR chemicals. The static bottle tests showed considerable changes under the test conditions.\nThe impact of EOR chemicals were also demonstrated by the remarkable ranges of crystal morphologies,\nchanging from simple aragonite columns to nanorod, distorted spheroid, and flower-like superstructure\nin the presence of EOR chemicals and inhibitors.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "QIWEI WANG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Feng Liang, Waleed Al-Nasser, Faez Al-Dawood, Tawfiq Al-Shafai, Hameed Al-Badairy, Shouwen Shen, Hassan Al-Ajwad"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Calcium carbonate, Scaling, Inhibitor, Chemical flooding, Enhanced oil recovery", "Sumber": "Petroleum 4 (2018) 375-384 - KeAi, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.03.003", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Jan 2019"}
