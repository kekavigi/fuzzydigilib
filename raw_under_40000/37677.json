Altogether 100 billion iris comparisons were performed in this study. The purpose was to evaluate whether, in the tradition of Doddington\u2019s Zoo, some individuals are inherently more prone than most to generate iris false matches, while others are inherently less prone. With the standard score normalisation disabled, a detailed inter-quantile analysis showed that meaningful deviations from a universal impostors distribution occur only for individual distributions that are highly extreme in both their mean and their standard deviation, and which appear to make up <1% of the population. In general, when different persons are compared, the IrisCode produces relatively constant dissimilarity distances having an invariant narrow\ndistribution, thanks to the large entropy which lies at the heart of this biometric modality. The authors discuss the implications of these findings and their caveats for various search strategies, including \u20181-to-first\u2019 and \u20181-to-many\u2019 iris matching.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "John Daugman [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Cathryn Downing"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "IET Biometrics", "Sumber": "IET Biometrics", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Apr 2019"}
