{"Nomor": 35320, "Judul": "Determining the influence of pressure and temperature on the elastic constants of anisotropic rock samples using ultrasonic wave techniques", "Abstrak": "Measuring rock elastic constants and anisotropy parameters and understanding their changes in response to\nchanges in pressure and temperature is crucial for modeling and interpreting seismic measurements. The rapid\nadvance in seismic exploration and characterization of conventional and unconventional reservoirs requires a\nthorough understanding of variations in seismic velocities in response to variations of the rock elastic constants\nand anisotropy parameters. In attempt to develop this understanding, we measured variations in the elastic constants of three rock samples in the lab as a function of temperature (up to 600 ?\nC) and pressure (up to 150 MPa) to\nsimulate the in-situ conditions using a triaxial ultrasonic pulse transmission method. The rock samples used in\nthis study came from a metamorphic rock core sample collected from a geothermal reservoir at the Larderello\nGeothermal Field in Italy. The rock samples have different chemical and structural composition and inherently\ncontain both vertical transverse isotropy (VTI) and orthorhombic isotropy.We used two different methods to calculate the elastic stiffness constants and corresponding anisotropic parameters including VTI and orthorhombic\nisotropy. Our results showed that increasing the pressure leads to an increase in the orthorhombic constants\nwhile increasing the temperature leads to a decrease in these constants. The lagging decrease of the elastic constants with respect to the decrease in the pressure is explained by the hysteresis phenomenon. These observations and results will promote a better understanding and interpretation of reservoirs within the seismic domain.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "H.B.
