{"Nomor": 37609, "Judul": "Resolution of coherent sources in power inversion arrays with a fast zero tracking algorithm", "Abstrak": "A fast zero tracking algorithm for\nresolving coherent sources in power inversion\nadaptive arrays is investigated. To resolve M\ndirectional sources with a maximum coherent\ngroup size of M,, the original M + 1 element\npower inversion array is augmented by M, - 1\nelements to result in a total of M, identical but\nspatially shifted M + 1 element arrays. After performicg\nsome simple preprocessing, the M controlling\nzeros in these M, arrays are adaptively\nupdated in a time-multiplexed manner by using\nthe LMS algorithm to minimise the spatially averaged\noutput power to track the external environment.\nSince only one zero is adjusted at any\ninstant, the new algorithm has almost the same\nimplementation complexity as when the LMS\nalgorithm is used directly. However, rather than\nhaving to use a root-finding routine, the directions\nof the sources can be obtained directly from the\nzeros being updated in the new algorithm. Also,\nwith the same asymptotic time constant for all the\nzeros, the new algorithm can be much faster than\nthe conventional LMS algorithm, especially under\nsituations where the eigenvalue spread of the\nelement covariance matrix is large.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "C.C.
