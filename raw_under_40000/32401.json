{"Nomor": 32401, "Judul": "Engineering biology and the grand challenges: Do we need a new R&D&I model?", "Abstrak": "Facing up to the grand challenges posed to society today requires a policy that counts the cost of environmental\ndamage, such as carbon emissions and air pollution. Technologies have arrived to address climate mitigation, but\nrelatively few of these are biotechnologies. Biotechnologies in environmental applications suffer a variety of inhibitors\n\u2013 political, social and technical, and yet the potential cannot be denied. The greatest technical promise for future\nbiotechnology mobilisation may be the standardisation of engineering biology that allows more rapid and less\nexpensive reduction to practice. However, decades of metabolic engineering for bio-based chemicals and materials\nhave brought many research successes but few commercial-scale products. To address this gap between laboratory\nand market, new models of R&D&I may be needed to speed up the process. In past, haste has not mattered. For the\nproposed generation and those that follow, there is a need for policy makers to abandon this complacency as recent\nevidence is showing that time is running out to keep global warming within internationally agreed limits.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Denis Gauvreau,  David Winickoff, Jim Philp3 [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Engineering biology", "Sumber": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8337452", "Staf Input/Edit": "Dany Yunandar", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
