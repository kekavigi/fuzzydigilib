{"Nomor": 35514, "Judul": "Treatment of textile wastewater by a hybrid ultrafiltration/electrodialysis process", "Abstrak": "Conventional treatment of textile wastewater is generally based on physical-chemical treatment. Although the\neffluents from this can be discharged directly there is an increasing interest in industrial wastewater reuse. The\npresent study is based on the investigation of the performance of a hybrid ultrafiltration/electrodialysis process\nfor the removal of COD, salt, and color. Effects of temperature and intrinsic resistances were analyzed to study\nthe ultrafiltration process. The ultrafiltration process was then integrated with electrodialysis (ED) for the\ntreatment of Primary treated textile wastewater (PTTW) and was found that the hybrid process was capable of\npromoting the quality of the treated textile wastewater. In case of treated textile by UF with a ceramic membrane, ED process was effectiveness where the removal efficiency of TDS and conductivity were 94.2, 97.1%\nrespectively corresponds to conductivity value of 0.450 mS/Cm at 25 min. It is noticeable that primary treated\ntextile wastewater with combined UF\u2013ED techniques present very similar values for the same parameter as the\nones presented by normal feed water.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ridha Lafi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Lassaad Gzara., Ramzi Hadj Lajimi., Amor Hafiane"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Membrane Textile wastewater Ultrafiltration Electrodialysis", "Sumber": "Chemical Engineering & Processing: Process Intensification 132 (2018) 105\u2013113", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Feb 2019"}
