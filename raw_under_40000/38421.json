{"Nomor": 38421, "Judul": "A  MODEL  OF  MANAGEMENT  INFORMATION  SYSTEM  FOR  TECHNICAL   SYSTEM MAINTENANCE", "Abstrak": "Technical systems for production are increasingly automate, which means that they have to work reliably. Therefore, the rapidly expanding concept of maintenance, where people would say that maintaining a process that allows the management of the technical condition and reliability during the entire life cycle of the system. Traditionally, maintenance has been considered as a support function, non-productive and not a core function adding little value to business. However it has been noticed that many manufacturing  industries  have  used  various  approaches  to  improve  maintenance  effectiveness.  An  analysis  of  the  problem  of  machines  and  industrial  systems  maintenance  as  well  as  maintenance  strategies  and  maintenance  management  process  is  presented in this paper. Furthermore, a development process of traditional and modern maintenance management information system  is  given.  The  possibility  of  development  maintenance  management,  applying  decision  support  systems  and  expert  systems, are presented, at the end.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Vlado Medakovic [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Bogdan Maric"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Maintenance, Information system, Decision Support Systems, Expert systems", "Sumber": "A CTA TECHNICA CORVINIENSIS  \u2013 Bulletin of Engineering Tome XI [2018]   | Fascicule 3 [July  \u2013 September]", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos \u00a0\n                                     Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Mei 2019"}
