{"Nomor": 32612, "Judul": "A Nondestructive Surface Zwitterionization of Polydimethylsiloxane for the Improved Human Blood-inert Properties", "Abstrak": "Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is extensively used in the\nfi\neld of biomaterials. However, its hydrophobicity still\nlimits its range of applications and makes it prone to biofouling. Various techniques are currently utilized to overcome this\nlimitation, but most of them reduce some of the PDMS prime characteristics, such as its mechanical strength and optical\ntransparency. In this work, we employed an original two-step coating process to bypass harsh treatments on PDMS like UV\n?\nozone or plasma treatment. A pre-coating step of tannic acid-Fe(III) complex was performed prior to the zwitterionization of\nthe PDMS with poly(glycidyl methacrylate-\nco\n-sulfobetaine methacrylate) or poly(GMA-\nco\n-SBMA) by a\n\u201c\ngrafting-to\n\u201d\napproach.\nSuccessful coating was evidenced by a decrease of the water-contact angle from 118\n\u00b0\nto 79\n\u00b0\n. The process was optimized, and the\noptimized coating condition led to a signi\nfi\ncant improvement of the PDMS biocompatibility while maintaining its mechanical\nproperty and optical transparency. In addition, a 90% reduction of\nEscherichia coli\nattachment and\nfi\nbrinogen plasma protein, an\n80% reduction of red blood cells and cells from whole-blood attachment, and a 60% reduction of platelets adhesion were\nmeasured. We further tested the potential of the zwitterionic PDMS material as a storage vessel for platelet-rich plasma under\nphysiological conditions. Platelet activation was decreased from 10.95% using virgin PDMS to 3.35% with the coated sample in\na period of 2 days", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Gian Vincent Dizon [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Maria Thea Rane Clarin", "Antoine Venault", "Lemmuel Tayo", "Heng-Chieh Chiang", "Jie Zheng", "Pierre Aimar", "Yung Chang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "PDMS, tannic acid and Fe(III) complex, zwitterionization, biocompatibility, platelet activation", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
