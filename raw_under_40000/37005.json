And where, physically,\ncan we locate the exciting but elusive trope called \u201cCentral/Eastern\nEurope\u201d? After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the revolutions of\n1989\u20131991, Central/Eastern Europe became something of an exotic\nimaginary for North American scholars. Not quite modern West and\nnot quite primitive East, the area and its inhabitants were still white,\nstill Western, still European\u2014but just strange enough to arouse the\nsenses, to entice occasional nostalgia or touristic fascination, and\nto elude easy understanding. Ah, Proust\u2019s Madeleine\u2014why, we can\nalmost taste it already\u2014even if it is perhaps made with lard and not\nNormandie butter.\nDuring the twentieth century the diverse geographic region of\nCentral/Eastern Europe\u2014which I define as lying within the greater\nEuropean arena\u2014experienced related, yet significantly different,\nversion(s) of modernity than its Western neighbors. For the West,\nthese \u201cother\u201d modernities were largely characterized by the violent\nintroduction of repressive governmental regimes in the mid-twentieth\ncentury. Since the early 1990s, scholarly attention has increasingly\nturned to this region, and especially to its \u201ceveryday,\u201d in order to get\nat the workings of socialism and post-socialism. Early work on Central/\nEastern Europe after 1989 often focused on subjects that followed easy political expectations of the region, such as towering castles, heavily\nindustrialized sites, and socialist-era monuments. The reasons for these\nearly, occasionally less nuanced approaches are readily apparent: we\nneed only look to the fifty-year isolation of Central/Eastern Europe\nand its categorization as \u201cenemy\u201d to understand the influence of Cold\nWar politics on North American. research", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Veronica E.
