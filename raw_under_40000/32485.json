{"Nomor": 32485, "Judul": "Bamboo Classification Using WorldView-2 Imagery of Giant Panda Habitat in a Large Shaded Area in Wolong, Sichuan Province, China", "Abstrak": "This study explores the ability of WorldView-2 (WV-2) imagery for bamboo mapping in\na mountainous region in Sichuan Province, China. A large area of this place is covered by shadows in\nthe image, and only a few sampled points derived were useful. In order to identify bamboos based\non sparse training data, the sample size was expanded according to the reflectance of multispectral\nbands selected using the principal component analysis (PCA). Then, class separability based on the\ntraining data was calculated using a feature space optimization method to select the features for\nclassification. Four regular object-based classification methods were applied based on both sets of\ntraining data. The results show that the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) method produced the greatest\naccuracy. A geostatistically-weighted k-NN classifier, accounting for the spatial correlation between\nclasses, was then applied to further increase the accuracy. It achieved 82.65% and 93.10% of the\nproducer\u2019s and user\u2019s accuracies respectively for the bamboo class. The canopy densities were\nestimated to explain the result. This study demonstrates that the WV-2 image can be used to identify\nsmall patches of understory bamboos given limited known samples, and the resulting bamboo\ndistribution facilitates the assessments of the habitats of giant pandas.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "YUNWEI TANG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Architecture", "Kata Kunci": "object-based analysis; bamboo mapping; WorldView-2; geostatistics", "Sumber": "Sensors 2016, 16, 1957; doi:10.3390/s16111957 www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur \u00a0\n                                     Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
