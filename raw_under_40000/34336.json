This article focuses on\nthe effects of one arts education project from a school readiness point of view. The main\nquestion was, How did the Helsinki arts education project affect the children\u2019s learning skills\nand attitudes? The target groups were children aged three to nine years who participated in\nthe arts project in day care centers and schools. A multidimensional evaluation method was\nused for the analyses. The research data consisted of interviews of the program artists and\neducators (nD23), follow-up reports (nD9), and other materials. The results show that the\nprogram motivated children and aroused their interest in thinking, problem-solving,\npracticing, and learning. It offered children opportunities to experience success, which\nincreased their self-confidence and skills. The project also strengthened their abilities in\nlistening, goal-oriented work, evaluating others\u2019 work, and receiving feedback, which are all\nabilities required for school entrance. The subject matter of their school courses was also\nintegrated into their achievements.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Saila Nevanen [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Antti Juvonen and Heikki Ruismaki"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "arts education, learning skills, multidimensional evaluation, school readiness", "Sumber": "ARTS EDUCATION POLICY REVIEW, 115: 72\u201381, 2014", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Feb 2019"}
