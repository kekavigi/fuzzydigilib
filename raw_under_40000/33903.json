{"Nomor": 33903, "Judul": "Features of the Application of the Seismic Events Localization Algorithm for Structure Recovery of the Geophysical Model of the Environment", "Abstrak": "This paper presents an approach to the localization of underground objects using the seismic event localization algorithm. An approach to the localization of objects of a certain form is shown using the analysis of initial seismic traces and the possibility of using parallel computations. The results of testing the localization algorithm for point objects of a homogeneous geophysical model of the environment are presented on model seismogram. It is shown that for point objects in a two-dimensional homogeneous environment this algorithm more accurately determines the position of the object at a depth than at the axis of a group of seismic receivers.
