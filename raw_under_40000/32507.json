{"Nomor": 32507, "Judul": "Personal journal bloggers: Profiles of disclosiveness", "Abstrak": "Personal journal blogs, which are primarily about bloggers\u2019 selves and inner states, are often characterized\nby high amounts of self-disclosure. This study employed the uses and gratifications perspective to\nreveal the characteristics of disclosive personal journal bloggers. Path analyses of data from an online survey\nrevealed that the most disclosive bloggers were women who were generally disclosive in their offline\nlives as well. Disclosive bloggers were typically motivated to blog to archive and organize their thoughts,\nmuch as one would expect for an online diary. Target audience was a stronger predictor of disclosiveness\nthan the potential audience. The theoretical and practical implications of study results are discussed,\nalong with potential directions for future research.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Erin E.
