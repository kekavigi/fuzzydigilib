{"Nomor": 32552, "Judul": "Laser-Fabricated Fluorescent, Ligand-Free Silicon Nanoparticles: Scale-up, Biosafety, and 3D Live Imaging of Zebra fi sh under Development", "Abstrak": "This work rationalizes the scalable synthesis of ultrasmall, ligand-free\nsilicon nanomaterials via liquid-phase pulsed laser ablation process using picosecond\npulses at ultraviolet wavelengths. Results showed that the irradiation time drives\nhydrodynamic NP size. Isolated, monodisperse Si-NPs are obtained at high yield (72%)\nusing post-treatment process. The obtained Si-NPs have an average size of\n?\n10 nm (not\naggregated) and display photoemission in the green spectral range. We directly\ncharacterized the ligand-free Si-NPs in a vertebrate animal (zebra\nfi\nsh) and assessed their\ntoxicity during the development.\nIn vivo\nassay revealed that Si-NPs are found inside in all\nthe early life stages of embryos and larvae growth, showing that the biosafety of Si-NPs\nand malformation types are independent of the Si-NP dose. Si-NPs were directly imaged\ninside developing embryos by spinning disk-imaging technique with optical sectioning\ncapability. We showed that Si-NPs can passively enter inside embryos by the pore canals\nof chorion, can di\nff\nuse in the circulatory system, i.e., blood vessel, and accumulate inside\nlarvae midgut and yolk sac, and in the eye lens, indicating the crossing of the blood\nbarrier", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Marta d Amora [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Marina Rodio", "Giuseppe Sancataldol", "Alberto Diaspro", "omuald Intartaglia"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "semiconductors, biocompatible materials, imaging agents, quantum dots, nanofabrication, laser ablation in liquid, biological materials, toxicology, translocation, blood barrier, biological imaging, fl uorecence imaging, optical materials", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
