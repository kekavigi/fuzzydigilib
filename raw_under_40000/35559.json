{"Nomor": 35559, "Judul": "Effects of urban wastewater on hyporheic habitat and invertebrates in Mediterranean streams", "Abstrak": "Wastewater discharges into fluvial ecosystems represent a significant and continuous source of fine particles and\nnutrients that can severely modify stream community composition and functionality. Depending on both wastewater and stream features (e.g., nutrient removal treatments and stream dilution capacity), the ecological effects\ncan be more or less severe. To determine how hyporheic habitat and hyporheos are affected, we analysed eight\nMediterranean streams both upstream and downstream of a wastewater effluent. The results demonstrated that\nenvironmental factors associated with clogging, such as the quantity of fine particulate and organic matter in sediment, were magnified downstream of the wastewater inputs. Likewise, dissolved nutrients also increased but\ndepended to a greater extent on the presence of a wastewater treatment plant and on the nitrogen and phosphorus removal treatments. The hyporheic invertebrates were more affected by clogging than by eutrophication.\nBoth richness and diversity parameters were negatively correlated with clogging features but were not correlated\nwith eutrophication. The most affected taxa were Macrocrustaceans, Hydrachnidia and several insect species,\nwhich decreased or were not detected downstream of the effluents. On the contrary, other taxa such as Naididae\n(Oligochaeta), Orthocladiinae (Chironomidae) and Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Gastropoda) benefited from the\nwastewater inputs.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Marc S\u00e1nchez-Morales [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Francesc Sabater.,Isabel Mu\u00f1oz"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Wastewater Hyporheic zone Hyporheic invertebrates Clogging Eutrophication", "Sumber": "Science of the Total Environment 642 (2018) 937\u2013945", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Feb 2019"}
