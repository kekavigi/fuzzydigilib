{"Nomor": 36894, "Judul": "Impact of the wastewater-mixing zone on attenuation of pharmaceuticals in natural waters: Implications for an impact zone inclusive environmental risk assessment", "Abstrak": "The direct discharge of untreatedwastewater has been identified as an important source of environmental contamination\nby active pharmaceutical ingredients and other \u2018down-the-drain\u2019 chemicals in developing countries. It necessitates\nthe development of an environmental risk assessment approach for the resulting impact zone. This studywas\ndesigned to investigate the impact of lowlevel of dilution (b10) on the natural attenuation processes of distribution\nand degradation within the impact zone. Dilution of the untreatedwastewater resulted in increased desorption and\ncorresponding environmental concentrations. The presence/absence of the microbial population in the batches\naffected the degree of sorption depending on the compound charge (i.e. positive or negative), highlighting an experimental\ntechnical bias. The degradation half-lives of acebutolol and diclofenac increased with increasing dilution and\nresulted in higher environmental persistence. The modelling of the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) allowed an\nestimate of the temporal end boundary of the impact zone to be predicted as 24 h. Therefore, itwas concluded that\nmost of the investigated compounds would persist beyond the end of the impact zone as defined by the return to\nenvironmental BOD concentrations. It is proposed that, within environmental risk assessment protocols, the impact\nzone should be considered as a semi-natural wastewater treatment area in such a way to allow the estimate of\nenvironmental concentrations of pharmaceuticals beyond its end", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Simone Bagnis [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mark F.
