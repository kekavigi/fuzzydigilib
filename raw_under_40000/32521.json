{"Nomor": 32521, "Judul": "Temporal Design: Rethinking time in design", "Abstrak": "From critiques of acceleration, to efforts to frame present actions within more extended futures, designers have been increasingly concerned with how perceptions of time influence practices and how these perceptions can be influenced by design. In this paper, we argue that perspectives of time in design are highly influenced by dominant narratives that describe time as uniform, external to practices, and in a state of continuous acceleration. We propose Temporal Design as a shift from pace, direction, and subjective experience towards looking at time as emerging out of relations between cultural, social, economic and political forces. We argue that this pluralist perspective helps to demystify problematic experiences, potentially enabling more inclusive ways of understanding time.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "LarissaPschetz [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["MichelleBastian"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "design research philosophy of design design theory interaction design", "Sumber": "Design Studies 56 (2018) 169-184", "Staf Input/Edit": "Erlin Marliana Effendi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
