It is suggested that the oil & gas reservoir is generally characterized by early accumulation, multi-stage filling, late cracking and later adjustment. The oil and\ngas were mainly sourced from lower Cambrian Qiongzhusi Formation, partly from the Permian\nsource rock. During the geological period, 3 major oil & gas fillings occurred in the Longwangmiao\nFormation, namely Caledonian-Hercynian filling that was small in scale and produced the first\nphase of paleo-oil reservoir that soon destroyed by Caledonian movement uplift, large-scale\nPermian filling that gave rise to the second-phase of paleo-oil reservoir and the Triassic-Jurassic\nfilling that enriched the second phase of paleo-oil reservoir. Finally, the paleo-oil reservoir experienced an in-situ cracking during the cretaceous period that gave rise to a natural gas reservoir and\nleft behind carbonaceous bitumen and oily bitumen in the holes of the Longwangmiao Formation", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mindong Jin [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jian Cao", "Chuanhua Shi", "Wei Zeng", "Cheng Shen", "Kailan Shi", "Xueying Cheng", "Xiucheng Tan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Gas reservoir, Bitumen, Accumulation evolution, Longwangmiao formation, Sichuan basin, Moxi-Gaoshiti area", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 2, Pages 130-137 (June  2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Mar 2019"}
