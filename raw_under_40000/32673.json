{"Nomor": 32673, "Judul": "An Investigation Study On Applications Of Optimization In Petroleum Engineering", "Abstrak": "For some petroleum fields, optimization of production operations can be a\nmajor factor on increasing production rates and reducing production cost. In\nthis work we investigated the formulations and solution methods for the\nfollowing optimization problem: determining the optimal production rates,\nlift gas rates, and well connections for a gathering system with tree-like\nstructures to maximize daily operational objectives subject to multiple flow\nrate and pressure constraints. While some aspects of this problem have been\nstudied by other investigators, existing methods are either inefficient or they\nare based on significant simplifications that lead to suboptimal solutions.\nHence, it is necessary to develop approaches that can solve the problem\nefficiently and without unreasonable assumptions. We first investigated\nefficient procedures for simulating the production system and computing\nsensitivity coefficients of production rates relative to system parameters.\nThese procedures have useful applications in simulation, sensitivity\nanalysis, and optimization of a petroleum field.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MOHAMMAD SOLEIMANI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ahmad Darabpour, Ahmad Mayahi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Optimization, Production operations, Production cost, pipeline network", "Sumber": "Bulletin of Pure and Applied Sciences Vol. 35 D (Physics) Issue (No.1-2) 2016:P.41-54.
