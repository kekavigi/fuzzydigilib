{"Nomor": 33060, "Judul": "Stacking of multilayout and multichannel surface-wave data on the f-k domain", "Abstrak": "Themultichannel surface-wavemethod is a current method used in geotechnical and environmental engineering\nto estimate the near surface shear-wave (S\u2013wave) velocity profile. This non-invasive technique is based on the\ndispersive characteristic of surface waves, typically Rayleigh waves, whose dispersion curves can be obtained\nfrom dispersion images like the wavefield f-k power spectra.\nHerein an efficient methodology for multilayout and multichannel surface-wave data processing is proposed.\nThis consists on stacking the recorded wavefields resultant from several acquisition layouts on the f-k domain:\nshot repetitions at the same position, shots at different offsets, direct and reverse shots, and also shots generated\nby different sources.\nThe use of diverse acquisition layouts allows different investigations of the site and can lead to different frequencies\nand propagation modes to be excited. The stacking of these corresponding f-k spectra provides a f-k sum\nspectrum with higher signal-to-noise ratio which will improve the resolution of the phase velocity dispersion\ncurves picked fromthat, for a larger frequency range. Consequently additional constraints will be available to invert\nthe dispersion curves resulting in more realistic models.\nReal data applications, like the ones here presented, have demonstrated that the proposed methodology is effective\nin increasing the dispersion curves resolution and accuracy for a wider frequency range, with significant improvements\nfor low frequencies (below 15 Hz).", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Maria Jo\u00e3o Coelho  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jaime Santos, Mar\u00edlia Pereira"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Shear-wave Rayleigh-wave Multichannel surface-wave method F-k processing F-k power spectrum stacking Dispersion curves resolution", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 159 (2018) 93\u2013107, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.08.006", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Jan 2019"}
