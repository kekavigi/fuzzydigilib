However, prior research has focused exclusively\non relations between mathematical language and numeracy skills,\nbroadly measured. Thus, the aim of the current study was to\nexplore more targeted relations between preschoolers\u2019 mathematical\nlanguage and specific numeracy skills (e.g., cardinality,\nnumeral comparison). The participants were 124 preschoolers\naged 3.52 to 6.03 years (M = 4.78 years, SD = 0.53). Children were\nassessed on a battery of early numeracy skills and mathematical\nlanguage as well as expressive vocabulary. Mixed-effects regression\nmodels were conducted, with school as a random effect and\nage, gender, and parental education as fixed effects covariates.\nResults indicated that mathematical language was significantly\nrelated to most numeracy skills, including verbal counting, oneto-\none correspondence, numeral identification, cardinality, comparisons\nof sets and/or numerals, ordering numerals, and story\nproblems. As hypothesized, mathematical language was not significantly\nrelated to either subitizing or formal addition because these\nskills are independent of general language ability. Importantly,\nmathematical language was generally more proximal to each of\nthese numeracy skills than was general language. These results\nprovide direction for future research, in particular for the development\nof more precise measures to identify children at risk for", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Caroline Byrd Hornburg [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sara A.
