{"Nomor": 35621, "Judul": "Experimental Study Of Iranian Heavy Crude Oil Viscosity Reduction By Diluting With Heptane, Methanol, Toluene, Gas Condensate And Naphtha", "Abstrak": "Due to the high viscosity of heavy crude oils, production from these reservoirs is a demanding task.\nTo tackle this problem, reducing oil viscosity is a promising approach. There are various methods to\nreduce viscosity of heavy oil: heating, diluting, emulsification, and core annular flow. In this study,\ndilution approach was employed, using industrial solvents and gas condensate. The viscosity of two\nIranian heavy crude oils was measured by mixing with solvents at different temperatures. Dilution\nof both oil samples with toluene and heptane, resulted in viscosity reduction. However, their effect\nbecame less significant at higher concentrations of diluent. Because of forming hydrogen bonds,\nadding methanol to heavy crude oil resulted in higher viscosity. By adding condensate, viscosity of\neach sample reduced. Gas condensate had a greater impact on heavier oil; however, at higher\ntemperatures its effect was reduced. Diluting with naphtha decreased heavy oil viscosity in the\nsame way as n-heptane and toluene. Besides experimental investigation, different viscosity models\nwere evaluate", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Amir Hossein Saeedi Dehaghani  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mohammad Hasan Badizad"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Heavy oil, Viscosity reduction, Dilution, Toluene, Methanol, n-Heptane, Naphtha, Gas condensate", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 4, Pages 415-424 (December 2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Feb 2019"}
