{"Nomor": 32541, "Judul": "A Formal Approach to Software Synthesis for Architectural Platforms", "Abstrak": "Software-intensive systems today often rely on middleware\nplatforms as major building blocks. As such, the architectural choices of such systems are being driven to a significant extent by such platforms. However, the diversity\nand rapid evolution of these platforms lead to architectural\nchoices quickly becoming obsolete. Yet architectural choices\nare among the most difficult to change. This paper presents\na novel and formal approach to end-to-end transformation of\napplication models into architecturally correct code, averting the problem of mapping application models to such architectural platforms.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "HAMID BAGHERI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Architecture", "Kata Kunci": "Architectural Styles, Architectural Maps", "Sumber": "https://dl.acm.org/", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
