{"Nomor": 37985, "Judul": "Quantitative Prediction Of Residual Wetting Film Generated In Mobilizing A Two-Phase Liquid In A Capillary Mode", "Abstrak": "This research studies the motion of immiscible two-phase liquid flow in a capillary tube through a\nnumerical approach employing the volume of fluid method, for simulating the core-annular flow\nand water flooding in oil reservoirs of porous media. More specifically, the simulations are a representation of water flooding at a pore scale. A capillary tube model is established with ANSYS\nFluent and verified. The numerical results matches well with the existing data available in the\nliterature. Penetration of a less viscous liquid in a liquid of higher viscosity and the development of\na residual wetting film of the higher viscosity liquid are thoroughly investigated. The effects of\nCapillary number, Reynolds Number and Viscosity ratio on the residual wetting film are studied in\ndetail, as the thickness is directly related to the residual oil left in the porous media after water\nflooding. It should be noticed that the liquids considered in this research can be any liquids of\ndifferent viscosity not necessarily oil and water. The results of this study can be used as guidance in\nthe field of water flooding", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "HARSH JOSHI  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Liming Dai"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Capillary model, Residual wetting film, Higher viscosity liquid, Water flooding, Numerical simulation, Immiscible flow, Oil slug mobilization", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 4, Pages 342-348 (December  2015)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Mei 2019"}
