{"Nomor": 33807, "Judul": "The Impacts Of Gas Impurities On The Minimum Miscibility Pressure Of Injected Co2-Rich Gas\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdCrude Oil Systems And Enhanced Oil Recovery Potential", "Abstrak": "An effective parameter in the miscible-CO2 enhanced oil recovery procedure is the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP)\ndefined as the lowest pressure that the oil in place and the injected gas into reservoir achieve miscibility at a given\ntemperature. Flue gases released from power plants can provide an available source of CO2, which would otherwise be\nemitted to the atmosphere, for injection into a reservoir. However, the costs related to gas extraction from flue gases is\npotentially high. Hence, greater understanding the role of impurities in miscibility characteristics between CO2 and\nreservoir fluids helps to establish which impurities are tolerable and which are not. In this study, we simulate the effects of\nthe impurities nitrogen (N2), methane (C1), ethane (C2) and propane (C3) on CO2 MMP. The simulation results reveal that,\nas an impurity, nitrogen increases CO2\u2013oil MMP more so than methane. On the other hand, increasing the propane (C3)\ncontent can lead to a significant decrease in CO2 MMP, whereas varying the concentrations of ethane (C2) does not have a\nsignificant effect on the minimum miscibility pressure of reservoir crude oil and CO2 gas. The novel relationships\nestablished are particularly valuable in circumstances where MMP experimental data are not available.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ABOUZAR CHOUBINEH  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Abbas Helalizadeh", "David A.
