{"Nomor": 39458, "Judul": "MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF LAPAN SURVEILLANCE UAV (LSU) \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd 02 FOR AUTOMATIC CONTROL AND GUIDANCE SYSTEM DESIGN", "Abstrak": "Nowadays the technology that is used in the Unmanned Aircraft Vehicle (UAV) has been developed rapidly including in Indonesia, making it possible to be used in many fields, including agriculture, mapping, military, transport, and search-and-rescue. LAPAN Surveillance UAV (LSU)-02 is one of the fixed-wing UAV in Indonesia that has been developed by LAPAN, the national aerospace research agency of Indonesia. The UAV has been equipped with automatic flight control system so it can fly automatically from one waypoint to another. However, the automatic system was not made based on the flight dynamic characteristic of the UAV. Therefore, optimization in certain flight condition becomes difficult.\nHence, the topic of this study is to develop a mathematical model of LSU-02 for automatic control and guidance system. A 6DOF (degree of freedom) non-linear mathematical model is build based on aerodynamics, weight & balance, and propulsion of the UAV. The model then evaluated by performing numerical simulation on the designed cruise condition. Additionally, an automatic flight control law is developed based on the linearized model.\nThe simulation results show a dynamically stable characteristics for longitudinal motion and an unstable characteristics for lateral-directional motion due to spiral mode. The designed automatic flight control (FC) is then implemented, which demonstrates improvement in stability, especially in the lateral mode. Finally, the model with automatic FC is simulated to perform a typical surveillance mission. The simulation has been performed smoothly, but with notes to improve, especially guidance optimization.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Aziz Fathurrahman": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/172044", "COVER Aziz Fathurrahman": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/206637", "BAB 1 Aziz Fathurrahman": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/206638", "BAB 7 Aziz Fathurrahman": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/206644", "PUSTAKA Aziz Fathurrahman": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/206645"}, "Penulis": "Aziz Fathurrahman [13615043]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Yazdi Ibrahim Jenie, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, Mathematical Modeling, Automatic Control, Guidance System", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti \u00a0\n                                     Alice Diniarti", "File": "10 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Jun 2019"}
