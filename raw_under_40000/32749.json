{"Nomor": 32749, "Judul": "A Workflow for Static Reservoir Modeling Guided by Seismic Data in a Fluvial System", "Abstrak": "Realistic and accurate static geologic models are an essential element\nneeded to predict the behavior of subsurface reservoirs and play an important role\nin petroleum engineering. Data used in the development of a static geologic model are\ngathered from various sources, such as seismic, log, and core data, each of them providing information on different physical properties of interest and with varying degrees of\nresolution. Compiling all data from various sources into a single representation of the\nsubsurface formation of interest is a daily challenge for many petroleum geologists and\nengineers. This paper describes a framework to develop and select process-mimicking\nmodels that are consistent with available seismic attributes, namely impedance. Using\na process-mimicking modeling package, 75 models of a fluvial meandering system\nare generated, one of which is chosen as the \u201ctrue\u201d model and masked thereafter. The\nimplemented selection method relies on the degree of similarity in the histogram of\nrepresentations of clusters of all possible patterns in the seismic impedance domain\nbased on each process-mimicking model and that of the \u201ctrue\u201d model at several resolutions. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the use of a weighted average\ndivergence distance across multiple levels to select process-mimicking models that\nhonor seismic data the best.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MOHAMMAD KONESHLOO [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Saman A.
