{"Nomor": 33727, "Judul": "Identification of microplastics in fish ponds and natural freshwater environments of the Carpathian basin, Europe", "Abstrak": "In the past few years, there has been a significant development in freshwater microplastic research.\nPollution has been detected in lakes and rivers of several continents, but the number of papers is still\nmarginal compared to the ones investigating marine environments. In this study, we present the first\ndetection of microplastics (MPs) in Central and Eastern European (CEE) surface waters and, globally, the\nfirst detection in fish ponds. Samples were taken from different types of fish ponds and natural water\nbodies along a novel concept down to a particle size of 100 mm, then, after sample preparation, MPs were\ncharacterized using an FTIR microscope. 92% of the water samples contained MPs ranging from 3.52 to\n32.05 particles/m3\n. MPs were detected in 69% of the sediment samples ranging from 0.46 to 1.62 particles/kg. Dominant abundance of polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene was shown in water and PP and\npolystyrene in sediment samples. First results also indicate that fish ponds may act as a deposition area\nfor MPs.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Gabor Bordos [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Bela Urbanyi.,Adrienn Micsinai.,Balazs Kriszt., Zoltan Palota.,Istvan Szabro.,Zsolt Hantosi.,Sandor Szoboszlay"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Microplastic Fish pond Freshwater Carpathian basin", "Sumber": "Chemosphere 216 (2019) 110 -116", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Jan 2019"}
