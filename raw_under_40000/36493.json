{"Nomor": 36493, "Judul": "An Unconventional Iron Nickel Catalyst for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction", "Abstrak": "The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key process that\nenables the storage of renewable energies in the form of chemical fuels.\nHere, we describe a catalyst that exhibits turnover frequencies higher than\nstate-of-the-art catalysts that operate in alkaline solutions, including the\nbenchmark nickel iron oxide. This new catalyst is easily prepared from\nreadily available and industrially relevant nickel foam, and it is stable for\nmany hours. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopic data reveal that the\ncatalyst is made of nanoclusters of ?-FeOOH covalently linked to a ?-\nNiOOH support. According to density functional theory (DFT)\ncomputations, this structure may allow a reaction path involving iron as\nthe oxygen evolving center and a nearby terrace O site on the ?-NiOOH support oxide as a hydrogen acceptor.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Fang Song [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Michael M.
