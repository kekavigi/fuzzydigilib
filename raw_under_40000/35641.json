Th   e Work of the Spirit in Place,  Time, and Secular Society?", "Abstrak": "This article examines the historic parallels between the development of American Pentecostalism \nand the formation of German Expressionism. German Expression is examined through the grid \nof  Restorationism,  African  Culture,  Experience,  and  heightened  Expressions  found  in  early  \nAmerican Pentecostalism. After their parallels are drawn out, significant questions regarding the \nrole of the Spirit in relation to these separate cultural circles are explored. Answers to some of \nthese questions encourage Pentecostal theology to look deeper into the concept of Sacred Time. \nIncluded is a look at the possible intersection of the Spirit and the artist community, calling for \ndeeper Pentecostal engagement with the arts.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jennifer A.
