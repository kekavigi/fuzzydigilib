{"Nomor": 34829, "Judul": "Most Common Surfactants Employed In Chemical Enhanced Oil Recovery", "Abstrak": "Chemical enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and particularly surfactant injection has recently received a\ngreat deal of attention. The suggested recovery mechanisms after injecting surfactants include\nwettability alteration and IFT reduction. If a surfactant is properly selected according to the environmental variables-such as pressure, temperature, salinity, it can lead to more efficient enhanced\nrecovery from an oil reservoir. On the other hand, poor selection of the surfactant can result in a\nlow recovery and can even become detrimental to the reservoir due to undesirable wettability\nalteration and possible rock dissolution resulting in a chemical reaction with displacing fluid and\nblockage of the pore space. Also, choosing the wrong surfactant without considering the rock\nmineralogy may result in high adsorption on the pore surface of the rock and unnecessary waste of\nresources. It is also worthy to note that surfactants are some of the most expensive chemicals used\nduring EOR. Extensive literature review suggests that anionic surfactant are the preferred surfactant\ncategory for EOR especially when it comes to sandstone reservoirs. Occasionally, in specific situations a better performance have been reported after injecting cationic, non-ionic or mixtures of\nboth surfactants, particularly when dealing with carbonate reservoirs. This paper presents in detail\na review of the most commonly applied surfactants in EOR studies and the optimum application\ncriteria for of each type. To the best of the authors' knowledge, such detailed and comprehensive\nreview is not available in the literature, presently", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Chegenizadeh Negin [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Saeedi Ali", "Quan Xie"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Surfactants, Enhanced oil recovery, Wettability, Interfacial tension", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 3, Issue 2, Pages 197-211 (Juni 2017)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Feb 2019"}
