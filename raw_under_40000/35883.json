The central focus of the article is on the author's contention that both hip-hop and cubism grew out of the influence of Africa on contemporary art and music. A number of topics are addressed including the activities of the group of cubist painters including Pablo Picasso and George Braque, hip-hop culture and globalization, and aspects of post-colonialism.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jim Perkinson [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Cubism, hip hop culture, globalization", "Sumber": "Cross Currents.
