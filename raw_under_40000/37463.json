{"Nomor": 37463, "Judul": "Unidirectional Real-Time Photoswitching of Diarylethene MolecularMonolayer Junctions with Multilayer Graphene Electrodes", "Abstrak": "We fabricate and characterize vertical molec-ular junctions consisting of self-assembled monolayers ofdiarylethene (DAE) contacted by a multilayer graphene(MLG) electrode on the top and gold on the bottom. TheDAE molecular junctions show two stable electrical states, aclosed state (high conductance) or an open state (lowconductance), which are created upon illumination with UVor visible light, respectively. For the Au-DAE-MLG junctionstructure, we observe that the current levels between the twoconductance states are separated by 2 orders of magnitude.However, in a real-time measurement, we observe onlyunidirectional switching behavior from the open to the closedstate", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJNRL_PP_JEOng_min_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164517"}, "Penulis": "Jeongmin Koo [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yeonsik Jang,Leo?n Martin,Dongku Kim,Hyunhak Jeong,Keehoon Kang,Woocheol Lee,Junwoo Kim,Wang-Taek Hwang,\u2020Dong Xiang,Elke Scheer,Mikhail Kabdulov,Thomas Huhn,Fabian Pauly,Takhee Lee"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "molecular electronics, photoswitching, diarylethene, self-assembled monolayer, graphene electrode", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
