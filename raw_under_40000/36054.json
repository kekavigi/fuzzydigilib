{"Nomor": 36054, "Judul": "LOW EMITTANCE LATTICE DESIGN FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES:REVERSE BENDING AND LONGITUDINAL GRADIENT BENDS", "Abstrak": "A unit cell with one homogeneous bending magnet is commonly used in the design of multi-bend\nachromat (MBA) lattices for the new generation of diffraction limited storage rings. But significantly lower\nemittance at moderate focusing properties can be achieved by combining longitudinal gradient bends\n(LGB) and reverse bends (RB) in a periodic lattice unit cell. LGBs alone, however, are of rather limited\ngain. We investigate the emittance achievable for different unit cell classes as a function of the cell phase\nadvance in a general framework, i.e., with a minimum of assumptions on the particular cell optics. Each\ncase is illustrated with a practical example of a realistic lattice cell, eventually leading to the LGB/RB unit\ncell of the baseline lattice for the upgrade of the Swiss Light Source.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "B.
