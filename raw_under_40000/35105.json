{"Nomor": 35105, "Judul": "Simultaneous and systematic analysis of cytostatic drugs in wastewater samples by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry", "Abstrak": "Cytostatic drugs are compounds used to fight cancer, which may be excreted after\nadministration to patients, and eventually reach wastewater. Given the high incidence of\ncancer and the properties of drugs, the drug concentrations in water systems should be\nevaluated.\nWe present the optimization, development and application of a solid phase\nextraction (SPE) method for the determination of eight cytostatic compounds of\ndifferent classes in wastewater and seawater samples. We compared four SPE cartridges\nprior to their determination by Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography tandem\nMass Spectrometry. For wastewater samples, the Oasis HLB cartridge gave the best\nrecoveries, which were higher than 65% in most cases, achieving limit of detections\n(LODs) of 1.68\u2013103.95 ng\u00b7L-1\n. In seawater samples, the Bond Elut cartridge afforded\nthe best recoveries greater than 70%, with LODs of 0.95\u20135.14 ng\u00b7L-1\n.The optimal procedure was applied in four hospital wastewater effluent samples\ntaken during one year, and in different influents and effluents from wastewater\ntreatment plants and seawater from marine outfalls taken in eight campaigns during two\nyears, in Gran Canaria island (Spain). Results showed that etoposide was present in\ninfluents of wastewater treatment plants in several months and different wastewater\ntreatment plants and hospital effluents in the range 375.8 \u2013 5141 ng\u00b7L-1\n, while\ncyclophosphamide was present in some months in effluents from only one wastewater\ntreatment plant and hospital effluents in the range 55.94 \u2013 1212 ng\u00b7L-1\n. Vinblastine and\nvincristine were detected in one sample of hospital at concentrations of 1836 ng\u00b7L-1\nand\n1851 ng\u00b7L-1\n, respectively.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "S.
