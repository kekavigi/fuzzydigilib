{"Nomor": 34887, "Judul": "Integrated geophysical investigations to reconstruct the archaeological features in the episcopal district of Side (Antalya, Southern Turkey)", "Abstrak": "Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) are frequently\nused geophysical methods in the exploration of near-surface targets such as archaeological\nfeatures. These methods were therefore applied to investigate a wide area in the Side ancient\ncity located nearby the Manavgat district of Antalya, Turkey. The main purpose of the\ngeophysical survey was to answer several questions about the design or usage of a huge area\nlocated nearby the episcopal residence of Side that belongs to the late antique/early Byzantine\ntimes. The investigation area is thought to be the garden (hortus) of the residence. The survey\nsite covering an area of approximately 6000m2 was investigated in detail by two geophysical\nsurvey campaigns carried out in 2016 and 2017. During the two survey campaigns, 102 ERT\nand 127 GPR lines were measured. ERT data were collected by dipole-dipole electrode array,\nand a 500 MHz shielded antenna was used to measure the GPR data. By evaluating both data\nsets with appropriate processing steps, 3D geophysical models of the survey area were\nproduced. These models provided obvious traces of buried anthropogenic structures,\ncharacterized by relatively high resistivity and high EM wave reflection amplitude. The\nidentified structures lay on the NS-EW axis, which is consistent with the major layout of the\ncity; however, they do not correctly align with the late period structures currently standing on\nthe ground. Therefore, it is interpreted that these buildings belong to a predecessor period (i.e.\nRoman Imperial Period). Further information such as the purpose of the use of these buildings\ncan only be revealed by an archaeological excavation.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Irfan Akca [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["\u00c7aglayan Balkaya, Andreas P\u00fclz, H.
