{"Nomor": 32968, "Judul": "A New Heuristic Model For Estimating The Oil Formation Volume Factor", "Abstrak": "The necessity of oil formation volume factor (Bo) determination does not need to be greatly emphasized.\nDifferent types of reservoir oil have specific conditions which impart the hydrocarbon's major properties,\namong which is the oil formation volume factor. Therefore, it seems imperative to construct a model\ncapable of estimating the value of oil formation volume factor. Previous studies have resulted in a\nnumber of correlations for oil formation volume factor estimation; however, a large portion of them do\nnot provide an acceptable accuracy (at least in some range of data) and cause a huge error at these points.\nSome others are not flexible enough to be tuned for a specific type of reservoir oil and a comprehensive\npiece of work does not exist as well in order to compare the applicability of the new models for estimating the oil formation volume factor. In this research, a model based on simulated annealing (SA) has\nbeen built in terms of temperature, solution gas-oil ratio, and gravity of oil and gas to predict the oil\nformation volume factor. This model is compared with the models proposed in the most recent studies,\nwhich shows the greater performance of the new method. In addition, in this paper the models of the\nrecent years were compared with each other and their applicability were discussed. Aiming to compare\nthe models, 420 data points were selected and the estimated values of each model for oil formation\nvolume factor were compared with their experimental ones.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MOHAMMAD REZA MAHDIANI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mohammad Norouzi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Artificial intelligence, PVT properties, Modelling, Temperature, Solution gas oil ratio, Gas gravity, Oil gravity", "Sumber": "Petroleum 4 (2018) 300-308 - KeAi, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.03.006", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Jan 2019"}
