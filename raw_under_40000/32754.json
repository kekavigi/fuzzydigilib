{"Nomor": 32754, "Judul": "Safety surrogate histograms (SSH): A novel real-time safety assessment of dilemma zone related conflicts at signalized intersections", "Abstrak": "Drivers\u2019 indecisiveness in dilemma zones (DZ) could result in crash-prone situations at signalized\nintersections. DZ is to the area ahead of an intersection in which drivers encounter a dilemma regarding\nwhether to stop or proceed through the intersection when the signal turns yellow. An improper decision\nto stop by the leading driver, combined with the following driver deciding to go, can result in a rear-end\ncollision, unless the following driver recognizes a collision is imminent and adjusts his or her behavior at\nor shortly after the onset of yellow. Considering the significance of DZ-related crashes, a comprehensive\nsafety measure is needed to characterize the level of safety at signalized intersections. In this study, a\nnovel safety surrogate measure was developed utilizing real-time radar field data. This new measure,\ncalled safety surrogate histogram (SSH), captures the degree and frequency of DZ-related conflicts at each\nintersection approach. SSH includes detailed information regarding the possibility of crashes, because it\nis calculated based on the vehicles conflicts. An example illustrating the application of the new\nmethodology at two study sites in Virginia is presented and discussed, and a comparison is provided\nbetween SSH and other DZ-related safety surrogate measures mentioned in the literature. The results of\nthe study reveal the efficacy of the SSH as complementary to existing surrogate measures.", "Daftar File": {"2015_EJRNL_PP_Sahar_Ghanipoor_Machiani_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/147049"}, "Penulis": "Sahar Ghanipoor Machiani [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Montasir Abbas"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Signalized intersections, Safety surrogate histogram (SSH), Time to collision (TTC), Dilemma zone (DZ), DZ-protection algorithms", "Sumber": "Science Direct", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "03 Jan 2019"}
