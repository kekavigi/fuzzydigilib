{"Nomor": 36155, "Judul": "Optically Coupled Electrically Isolated, Monolithically IntegratedSwitch Using AlxGa1?xN/GaN High Electron Mobility TransistorStructures on Si (111)", "Abstrak": "In this article, we report on an optically coupled, electrically isolated switchbased on the III-nitride heterostructures on a silicon substrate. All the circuit elements,including the ultraviolet (UV) detector and a normally on transistor, were monolithicallyintegrated on a single AlxGa1?xN/GaN high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) stackgrown on a 200 mm Si (111) substrate, and the process was fully compatible withconventional III-N HEMT fabricationflow. On-wafer UV detector was realized using a gate-recessed architecture which exhibited excellent spectral responsivity and broadband nature,while the discrete HEMT was found to exhibit ON current of 500 mA/mm. The integratedsystem was found to switch from an OFF-state current of 5?A (UV-Off) to an ON-statecurrent of 50 mA (UV-ON) in?4 ms, and this delay may be further reduced withoptimization of such a monolithic device design and improvement of crystal quality ofnitrides on the large area Si platforms", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Sandeep_Kumar_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/161721"}, "Penulis": "Sandeep Kumar [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Anamika Singh Pratiyush,Surani Bin Dolmanan,Hui Ru Tan,Sudhiranjan Tripathy,Rangarajan Muralidharan,Digbijoy Neelim Nath"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "UV detector, HEMTs, spectral responsivity, broadband switch", "Sumber": "ACSAppl.Electron.Mater.XXXX, XXX, XXX?XXX", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Mar 2019"}
