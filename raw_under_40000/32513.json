{"Nomor": 32513, "Judul": "Design project failures: Outcomes and gains of participation in design", "Abstrak": "This article draws on data from a participatory design project developing\nservices for online youth counselling. It investigates the outcomes and\ncontingencies of participation for stakeholders and how they make sense of their\nexperiences of participating in a design project. The findings show how\ncounsellors involved in a design process develop new skills and knowledge as\ntheir roles and work practices change over time. The study is longitudinal, and\naddresses temporal aspects of participation, and in particular what happens\nwhen design efforts come to an end. It is found that a participatory design\nproject that fails with respect to its explicitly stated goals may still have positive\nsecondary outcomes due to engagement and process of situated learning among the participants", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Sofia Lundmark [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "participatory design case study design practice teamwork transformative participation", "Sumber": "Design Studies 59 (2018) 77-94", "Staf Input/Edit": "Erlin Marliana Effendi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
