{"Nomor": 37600, "Judul": "Broadband electro-optic frequency comb generation in a lithium niobate microring resonator", "Abstrak": "Optical frequency combs consist of equally spaced discrete\noptical frequency components and are essential tools for optical\ncommunication, precision metrology, timing and spectroscopy1\u20139.\nAt present, combs with wide spectra are usually generated by modelocked\nlasers10 or dispersion-engineered resonators with third-order\nKerr nonlinearity11. An alternative method of comb production\nuses electro-optic (EO) phase modulation in a resonator with\nstrong second-order nonlinearity, resulting in combs with excellent\nstability and controllability12\u201314. Previous EO combs, however, have\nbeen limited to narrow widths by a weak EO interaction strength\nand a lack of dispersion engineering in free-space systems. Here\nwe overcome these limitations by realizing an integrated EO comb\ngenerator in a thin-film lithium niobate photonic platform that\nfeatures a large EO response, ultralow optical loss and highly colocalized\nmicrowave and optical fields15, while enabling dispersion\nengineering. Our measured EO comb spans more frequencies than\nthe entire telecommunications L-band (over 900 comb lines spaced\nabout 10 gigahertz apart), and we show that future dispersion\nengineering can enable octave-spanning combs. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate the high tolerance of our comb generator to modulation\nfrequency detuning, with frequency spacing finely controllable\nover seven orders of magnitude (10 hertz to 100 megahertz), and\nwe use this feature to generate dual-frequency combs in a single\nresonator. Our results show that integrated EO comb generators\nare capable of generating wide and stable comb spectra. Their\nexcellent reconfigurability is a powerful complement to integrated\nKerr combs, enabling applications ranging from spectroscopy16 to\noptical communications8.\nThe migration of optical frequency", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mian Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Brandon Buscaino, Cheng Wang, Amirhassan Shams-Ansari, Christian Reimer, Rongrong Zhu, Joseph M.
