{"Nomor": 34523, "Judul": "Application of geoelectrical measurements for detecting the ground-water seepage in clay quarry at Helwan, southeastern Cairo, Egypt", "Abstrak": "Clay is considered one of the most important raw materials in cement industry. It is the most common rich source\nof silica and alumina. During the quarrying process a few months later, a new feature of water accumulation\nappeared on the quarry floor and many water pools were formed during excavation process. In order to detect\nthe source and extension of the ground-water seepage, geoelectrical resistivity technique in the form of vertical\nelectrical soundings was applied. Fifteen vertical electrical soundings with AB/2 from 1 to 150m have been\nexecuted.\nGeoelectrical resistivity measurements are applied in Helwan clay quarry to understand the source of the\ngroundwater accumulated recently on the floor of quarry. The results indicate the passage of groundwater from\nthe adjacent areas through channel ways formed as a result of the excavation process. All over the measured\narea, there are some sand lenses intercalated with clays & during the excavation process, some channels formed\nand the groundwater started to percolate through these channels forming many water pools along the quarry\nfloor", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "A.M.S.
