{"Nomor": 37657, "Judul": "Moment-based performance evaluation of digital transmission systems", "Abstrak": "The average error probability P, in\nmany digital communications systems can be\nexpressed as the statistical expectation of a known\nfunction f( .) of some random interference variable\n(or vector) x. This paper presents a unified\ntheory to evaluate P, based on moment error\nbounds or approximations, when the moments of\nX are available. The theory can also be extended\nto random variables with inaccurately known\nmoments. The relevant numerical question of\naccuracy and roundoff errors due to averaging\nwith the aid of high-precision rules is addressed.\nExamples of application to spread-spectrum\nmultiple-access systems, optical fibre systems and\nmicrowave digital radio-relay links are presented\nto show the applicability of the proposed methods\nto different environments.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "S.
