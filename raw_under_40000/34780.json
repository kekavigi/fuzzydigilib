{"Nomor": 34780, "Judul": "Statistical method to predict the sunspots number", "Abstrak": "Sunspots are dark regions, it is appearing in the deepest layer of solar atmosphere \u201cphotosphere\u201d, and the\naverage number of sunspots has cycle every 11 year approximately. Sunspots cycles were numbered with solar\ncycle 1 beginning in 1755 and the most recent solar cycle, is cycle 24, began in December, 2008. Many authors\nused different techniques and precursor methods to forecast solar sunspots cycles. In this work we applied a new\nstatistical method \u201cautoregressive integrated moving average Models (ARIMA)\u201d on sunspots number data observed\nby National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) during the period 1991 \u2013 2017 (27 years),\nwe predict the sunspot number for the ending of second brunch of current solar sunspots cycle 24. Our prediction\nof sunspot numbers was compared with the international sunspot number predicted by National Oceanic and\nAtmospheric Administration (NOAA). Our predictions of monthly mean sunspot numbers along ending years of\npresent solar cycle 24 are in a good agreement with international sunspots number predictions published by\nNOAA.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "H.I.
