{"Nomor": 38461, "Judul": "CREATING COMMUNITY-BASED PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH IN A DIVERSE COMMUNITY: A CASE STUDY", "Abstrak": "COMMUNITIES STRUGGLE TO CREATE\nresearch guidelines for ethical collaborative research within their locale. In Lawrence, Massachusetts (USA) a collaborative group of community members and academic researchers, known as the Mayor\u2019s Health Task Force Research Initiative Working Group, took on the challenge of creating guidelines for ethical communitybased research. This case study of the Task Force\u2019s work addresses questions of research ethics in a diverse community where families struggle with few resources and face many health disparities, under the often-intrusive and unhelpful scrutiny of researchers from the many nearby major research universities. Representatives from the city, community organizations, and research universities developed a set of core ethical principles for research partnerships, a list of criteria for agreements between partners, and a model to help guide researchers and community members toward equitable and mutually beneficial research. This model can be generalized to similar other communities.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "LINDA SILKA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["G.
