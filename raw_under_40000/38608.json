{"Nomor": 38608, "Judul": "Nanomaterials for Diagnosis: Challenges and Applications in Smart Devices Based on Molecular Recognition", "Abstrak": "Clinical diagnosis has always been dependent on the\nefficient immobilization of biomolecules in solid matrices with\npreserved activity, but significant developments have taken place in\nrecent years with the increasing control of molecular architecture in\norganized films. Of particular importance is the synergy achieved with\ndistinct materials such as nanoparticles, antibodies, enzymes, and\nother nanostructures, forming structures organized on the nanoscale.\nIn this review, emphasis will be placed on nanomaterials for\nbiosensing based on molecular recognition, where the recognition\nelement may be an enzyme, DNA, RNA, catalytic antibody, aptamer,\nand labeled biomolecule. All of these elements may be assembled in\nnanostructured films, whose layer-by-layer nature is essential for\ncombining different properties in the same device. Sensing can be\ndone with a number of optical, electrical, and electrochemical methods, which may also rely on nanostructures for enhanced\nperformance, as is the case of reporting nanoparticles in bioelectronics devices. The successful design of such devices requires\ninvestigation of interface properties of functionalized surfaces, for which a variety of experimental and theoretical methods have\nbeen used. Because diagnosis involves the acquisition of large amounts of data, statistical and computational methods are now in\nwidespread use, and one may envisage an integrated expert system where information from different sources may be mined to\ngenerate the diagnostics", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Osvaldo N.
