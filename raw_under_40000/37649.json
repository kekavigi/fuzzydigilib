{"Nomor": 37649, "Judul": "Safety of laparoscopic graspers with different configurations during liver tissue clamping", "Abstrak": "Laparoscopic graspers often induce liver damage when large forces are applied during clamping. Here, the\nsafety of graspers with different edge curvature radii, teeth profiles, and jaw windows was evaluated experimentally using a tissue damage assessment method based on in vivo compression tests in a rabbit liver model. The results showed that the degree of damage to liver tissue was associated with the deformation in the tissue and the grasper configuration. Changing the jaw teeth profile from a wedge to a sine, increasing the curvature radius of the jaw edge, reducing the contact coefficient of the square window of the jaw, and increasing the length of the window edge alleviated the damage to liver tissue when a clamping force of 2 N was applied. The results can guide the selection and design of non-traumatic graspers.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jin Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Li Ma, Wei Li,  Zhongrong Zhou"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Safety of laparoscopic graspers, liver tissue clamping", "Sumber": "Biosurface and Biotribology IET JOURNALS", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Apr 2019"}
