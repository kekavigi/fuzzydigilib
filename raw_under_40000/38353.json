{"Nomor": 38353, "Judul": "Making Sense of Canada's Public Image in China", "Abstrak": "A country's  image  is the product largely of one nation's  socially constructed  perception  (or\nmisperception)  of another nation. A country's image may seem politically insignificant,  but\nits  image  and  associated  identity  are  often  socially  meaning\u00f1il  and  have  an  important\nimpact  on  the  overall  milieu  for  narratives  and  discourses  in  intemational  relations.  This\nessay intends to make sense  of Canada's image among Chinese. It first defines  the  concept\nof \"image\" and  specifically  Canada's image in China. Then, through  examination  of various\naspects  of image-making,  such  as  symbolic  individual  figures,  media  venues, and  popular\ntopics,  this  article  seeks  to  deconstruct  this  image.  It  argues  that  the  Canadian  image  is\nimportant for Sino-Canadian relations because a country's image and reputation are among\nthe most valuable assets its people possess and a key component of soft power. The political\nweight  of public image, however,  is more the product  of a country's importance and less its\nimage. For example, compared  to the  relatively negative public  image  of the  United  States\nin China, Canada's more positive public  image does not make  it more important  to  China's\ngovemment  or its people.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yuchao Zhu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Country's image; image-making; China; Canada; diplomacy; soft power", "Sumber": "Journal of American-East  Asian   Relations   20   {2013)  269-285", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Mei 2019"}
