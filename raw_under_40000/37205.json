{"Nomor": 37205, "Judul": "Multistable Free States of an Active Particle from a Coherent Memory Dynamics", "Abstrak": "We investigate the dynamics of a deterministic self-propelled particle endowed with coherent memory.\nWe evidence experimentally and numerically that it exhibits several stable free states. The system is\ncomposed of a self-propelled drop bouncing on a vibrated liquid driven by the waves it emits at each bounce. This object possesses a propulsion memory resulting from the coherent interference of the waves\naccumulated along its path.We investigate here the transitory regime of the buildup of the dynamics which\nleads to velocity modulations. Experiments and numerical simulations enable us to explore unchartered\nareas of the phase space and reveal the existence of a self-sustained oscillatory regime. Finally, we show the coexistence of several free states. This feature emerges both from the spatiotemporal nonlocality of this\npath memory dynamics as well as the wave nature of the driving mechanism.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "V.
