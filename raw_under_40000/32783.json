{"Nomor": 32783, "Judul": "Impulsivity and risky decision making among taxi drivers in Hong Kong: An event-related potential study", "Abstrak": "Taxi drivers play an important role in providing safe and professional public transport services. However,\nthey tend to be more involved than other professional driver groups in accidents caused by deliberate\nrecklessness. This study used an event-related potential (ERP) experiment to examine risk-taking\nbehavior arising from impulsivity by comparing the underlying neural processes of taxi drivers with\nand without traffic offence records in Hong Kong. A sample of 15 traffic offenders and 15 nonoffenders,\nmatched by sociodemographic characteristics, was recruited. The results show that the offender\ngroup demonstrated significantly less negative-going (less negative) feedback-related negativity but\nmore positive-going (more positive) feedback-related P300 when than with their nonoffending counterparts.\nThese findings show that taxi drivers with traffic offence records were less sensitive to the\nconsequences of behavior and more attuned to the magnitude of potential reward. In addition, behavioral\ndata revealed that they were more willing to make risky decisions. All these characteristics pertain\nto impulsive personality traits. Based on these findings, we can conclude that the offenders in this sample\nwere more impulsive than their nonoffending counterparts.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Andy S.K.
