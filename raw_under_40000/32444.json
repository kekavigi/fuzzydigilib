{"Nomor": 32444, "Judul": "Tuning thermoelectric transport in phosphorene through a perpendicular magnetic field", "Abstrak": "We address perpendicular magnetic field effects on the electrical conductivity, electronic thermal conductivity,\nthermopower, and figure of merit in phosphorene. By means of continuum Hamiltonian model and the Green\u2019s\nfunction approach, we report a significant difference in the magneto-thermoelectric properties. Results showcase\nan irregular (regular) behavior in AC (ZZ) direction for electrical conductivity in the presence of a magnetic field.\nFurthermore, we found an oscillating (increasing) treatment for the Drude weight with increasing magnetic field\nin AC (ZZ) direction at low temperatures. Also, the electronic thermal conductivity findings introduce the ZZ\ndirection as the right direction in thermoelectric real applications of phosphorene because electronic thermal\nconductivity in ZZ direction decreases with the magnetic field. In contrast to the electrical conductivity and\nelectronic thermal conductivity, thermopower in AC direction satisfies the requirements of efficient thermoelectric\nproperties at strong magnetic fields. These dependency aspects of the electronic transport coefficients\nprovide insights to modulate the real applications in nanoelectronics.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "M.
