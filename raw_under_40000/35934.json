{"Nomor": 35934, "Judul": "Self-Assembled Porphyrin-Based Nanoparticles with EnhancedNear-Infrared Absorbance for Fluorescence Imaging and CancerPhotodynamic Therapy", "Abstrak": "Two novelmeso-A2B2-porphyrins (P1 and P2)with symmetrical phenylethynyl groups were synthesized byintroducing amphiphilic triethylene glycol moieties onto theparent structure, which improved the near-infrared (NIR)absorbance and resulted in efficient singlet oxygen (1O2)generation. Through solvent-exchange based self-assemblyapproach, the corresponding hydrophilic nanoparticles (NPs)were fabricated. Thereby, as-prepared NP1 and NP2presented obvious red-shifted absorbance in NIR regionwith homogeneous size, superb biocompatibility, higher1O2generation, and good phototoxicity as well as low darkcytotoxicity. Furthermore, cellular uptake behavior of the NPswas evaluated by confocal microscopy, which demonstratedthat the NPs could easily go through the cell membrane and distribute in cytoplasm with desiredfluorescence imagingperformance. All results suggest the potential application of the two porphyrin-based NPs influorescence imaging guided cancerphotodynamic therapy.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Dong_Pan_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/161243"}, "Penulis": "Dong Pan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pingping Liang,Xiangmin Zhong,Dong Wang,Self-Assembled Porphyrin-Based Nanoparticles with EnhancedNear-Infrared Absorbance for Fluorescence Imaging and CancerPhotodynamic TherapyDong Pan,\u2020,?Pingping Liang,\u2021,?Xiangmin Zhong,Dong Wang,Hui Cao,Wenjun Wang,Wanli He,Zhou Yang,Xiaochen Dong"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "porphyrin, nanoparticles,fluorescence imaging, photodynamic therapy", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
