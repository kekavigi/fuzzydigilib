{"Nomor": 32375, "Judul": "WORD OF MOUTH INNOVATION DIFFUSION MODEL 1", "Abstrak": "Diffusion of ideas, innovation and many other forms of interest has not only\nmanaged to plague humanity but also confound us due to their spontaneous\nnature. People around the world has used many means (innovation diffusion, heat\ndiffusion, bass theory, agent-based model) to understand and find the underlying\nlaw behind such phenomenon. This thesis strives to understand the general outline\nthrough computational simulation, C++ program. The program is designed to\ngenerate a seeding and member activation using agent-based model, where\nrandom networking and adoption takes place, simulating an actual innovation\ndiffusion in live community. Random network creates connection, relation and the\nnumber of ties a member might have which allows the adoption process to\npropagate within the network, affecting each member by a certain probability.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mohamad Mulkinugraha [10211047]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr.rer.nat.
