{"Nomor": 37250, "Judul": "The Influence Of Water-Based Drilling Fluid On Mechanical Property Of Shale And The Wellbore Stability", "Abstrak": "Because of high cost and pollution of oil-based drilling fluid, the water-based drilling fluid is\nincreasingly used now. However, bedding planes and micro-cracks are rich in shale formation.\nWhen water-based drilling fluid contacts formation rock, it causes the propagation of crack and\ninvasion of drilling fluid, which decrease shale strength and cause wellbore instability. In this paper,\nwe analyzed influence of water-based drilling fluid on shale strength and failure mode by mechanics experiment. Based on those experimental results, considering the effect of bedding plane\nand drilling time, we established modeling of wellbore stability for shale formation. The result from\nthis model indicates that in certain azimuth of horizontal well, collapsing pressure increases\ndramatically due to shale failure along with bedding plane. In drilling operation, those azimuths are\nsupposed to be avoided. This model is applicable for predication of collapsing pressure in shale\nformation and offers reference for choosing suitable mud weight", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Shu He [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Lixi Liang", "Yinjin Zeng", "Yi Ding", "Yongxue Lin", "Xiangjun Liu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Water-based drilling fluid, Shale, Bedding plane, Wellbore stability", "Sumber": "Petroleum,Volume 2, Issue 1, Page 61-66 (March 2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Mar 2019"}
