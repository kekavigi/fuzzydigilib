Although time-series data\nanalysis using different feature extraction methods has been developed to improve data classification in machine learning, one of the remaining challenges is the spatial effects of sensory data. Methods that are suitable for individual sensor data are often limited due to their\ninability to account for system-level multivariate analysis of a group of sensory data. In this study, we attempted to develop a singular value\ndecomposition (SVD)-based feature extraction method by designing a Hankel matrix to enhance multivariate analysis. We also presented a\nconventional autoregressive model (AR) and multivariate vector autoregressive model (VAR) for comparison to demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the SVD method for feature extraction. Further discussion was presented to qualitatively quantify the effects of uncertainty due to noise\ninterference on the features and quantitatively evaluate the robustness of the feature extraction methods under different noise levels. The case\nstudy of a laboratory-based frame structure revealed that three feature extractions exhibited high capability in capturing designed damage\nscenarios, when sensory data was collected near the damage resources. However, the AR and VAR methods were both insensitive in detecting\nchange when data were not near the event, which could be the case in real-world applications. By contrast, the SVD-based feature extraction\nmethod exhibited promising results for all cases", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP HONG PAN 1": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/159364"}, "Penulis": "Hong Pan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zhibin Lin,  Guoqing Gui"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Time series, Data-driven approach, Damage identification, Structural health monitoring, Machine learning.", "Sumber": "Journal of Aerospace Engineering ISSN (print): 0893-1321 | ISSN (online): 1943-5525 Frequency: Bimonthly | Sponsored by the Aerospace Division", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Feb 2019"}
