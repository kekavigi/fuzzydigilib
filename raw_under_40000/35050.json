{"Nomor": 35050, "Judul": "3D printed floating photocatalysts for wastewater treatment", "Abstrak": "Organic contaminants, specifically contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), have a great environmental impact, since the removal of these pollutants is of great difficulty by conventional treatments and the presence of\nthese pollutants in the aquatic medium, even at low concentrations, is extremely hazardous to human health.\nAdvanced oxidation processes and, specifically, TiO2-photocatalytic process is considered an option with positive results for an efficient treatment. However, the photocatalyst must be accessible to the UV radiation, for the\nactivation of the TiO2. For this reason, it is recommendable to use a floating photocatalyst (with lower density\nthan water) if the UV light comes from the solar radiation, because it will be on the water surface. In addition,\nthis characteristic of the catalyst can entail an increase of the process efficiency if the pollutant is mainly located\non the surface of water. In this context, the goal of this work is the preparation of floating photocatalysts for the\nremoval of CECs from wastewater. TiO2 is deposited in low-density-polyethylene (LDPE), support with lower\ndensity than water and high stability and resistance to degradation. LDPE-TiO2 mixtures were prepared by\ndifferent methods: mixing TiO2 and LDPE in a hot-cylinder-mixer or using o-xylene or an anionic surfactant as\ndispersing agent, in order to increase the dispersion of TiO2 before extrusion. Filaments obtained were printed as\nmeshes in a Fused-Deposition-Modelling 3D-printer. The printed photocatalysts improved the activity in comparison with the plate obtained in the cylinder, used as benchmark. Thus, this study opens the doors to the in-situ\ntreatment of CECs, using floating photocatalysts and solar radiation as the sole reagent, a very economical,\nefficient, easily implantable and environmentally compatible process.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mar\u00eda J.
