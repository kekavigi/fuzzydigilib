In these areas, the extent and quality of the natural environment can be defined as dormant capital, which is currently not used sufficiently to sustain local livelihoods either fully or partially. This natural potential represents a value that we must treat in a respectful, sustainable way and use it in a wise, conscious approach (without exploitation) to help preserve the community of a given settlement. Appropriate attitudes and commitment are often present in local civil societies and local NGO\u2019s. These small, motivated communities can, with their untiring perseverance, attract funding sources into the regions, cooperate with local governments, and add their own human capacity so that the natural environment should be regarded valuable at the level of the settlement, and its resources should be used in a careful manner.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Szent Istv\u00e1n [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "territorial cohesion, districts, landscape ecology, complex indicators, NGO\u2019s", "Sumber": "ANNALS of Faculty Engineering Hunedoara \u2013 International Journal of Engineering Tome XVI [2018]  Fascicule 4 [November]", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Mar 2019"}
