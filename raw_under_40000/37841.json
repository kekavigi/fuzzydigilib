The uncertainty\nin the system is concerned with normally distributed random variables with zero mean value and\ngiven covariance. Based on the theoretical model and the measured acceleration responses, the\nprobabilistic structuralmodels in undamaged and damaged states are obtained by two-stage model\nupdating, and then the Probabilities of Damage Existence (PDE) of each element are calculated\nas the damage criterion. The influences of the location of sensors on the damage identification\nresults are also discussed, where one of the optimal sensor placement techniques, the effective\nindependence method, is used to choose the nodes for measurement. The damage identification\nresults by different numbers of measured nodes and different damage criterions are compared in\nthe numerical example.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xiaojun Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Chen Yang, Lei Wang, Zhiping Qiu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "damage identification, model updating, uncertainty, probabilistic approach, dynamic response", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect: Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 27, No. 2, April, 2014", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Apr 2019"}
