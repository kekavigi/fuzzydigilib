{"Nomor": 34297, "Judul": "Impact of industrial wastewater on the dynamics of antibiotic resistance genes in a full-scale urban wastewater treatment plant", "Abstrak": "Urban Wastewater Treatment Plants (UWTPs) treating mixed urban sewage and industrial wastewater are\namong the major hotspots for the spread of Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs) into the environment. This\nstudy addresses the impact of the wastewater origin on ARG dynamics in a full-scale UWTP (15,000 Population\nEquivalent, PE) by operating the plant with and without industrial wastewater. Composite samples (4 L) from\ndifferent treatment points were characterized for their chemical composition, bacterial abundance and for the\nabundance of four resistance genes against tetracycline, sulfonamides, erythromycin, and quinolones (tetA,\nsul2, ermB, and qnrS), and of the class 1 integrons (intI1). Although the chemical composition of the outflow significantly differed when the plant operated with or without industrial wastewater, the system efficiency in the\nremoval of bacterial cells, ARGs, and intI1 was constant. The final disinfection by peracetic acid (PAA) did not affect the removal of ARGs, independently of the wastewater origin and the chemical characteristics of the inflows.\nOur results demonstrated that a well-functioning small size UWTP could treat a significant amount of industrial\nwastewater mixed in the urban sewage without affecting the overall ARGs and class 1 integrons released into the\nenvironment.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Antonino Fiorentino [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Andrea Di Cesare.,Ester M.
