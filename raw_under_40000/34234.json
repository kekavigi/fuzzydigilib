{"Nomor": 34234, "Judul": "Can an Islamic model of housing finance cooperative elevate the economic status of the underprivileged?", "Abstrak": "A formal home loan is onerous to subprime borrowers in efficient markets. This can deter\nhomeownership for financially strapped individuals, leading to a market failure. This paper\nproposes a special form of cooperative mortgage financing (practiced in Oman) to overcome\nthis market failure. We integrate the literature of mortgage design with that of informal\nsavings schemes (i.e., ROSCAs/ASCRAs) to illustrate that this mode of financing dissipates\ncredit risk better than the formal mode of financing. It is also resilient to volatility of interest\nrates and allows prepayments without any additional charges. Finally, we verify the\nassertions of Besley et al. (1994) and Hart and Moore (1998) that cooperative mortgages\nare pareto-superior to formal mortgages in special cases.", "Daftar File": {"2018_EJRNL_M__SHAHID_EBRAHIM_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/155330"}, "Penulis": "M.
