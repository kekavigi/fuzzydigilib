{"Nomor": 35627, "Judul": "Displaying Garbage: Installations as Spaces of Domination  and Resistance", "Abstrak": "Contemporary artistic installations presenting the detritus of everyday life are an increasingly popular method of raising awareness of what we  produce,  consume,  and  throw  away.  As  social  critique,  these  displays examine the political and economic causes and consequences of waste production and resulting ecological degradation. Drawing on  Herbert Marcuse\u2019s conceptions of aesthetics, liberation, and ecology in  capitalism,  this  article  attempts  to  discern  where  we  might  find  hope,  encouragement,  and  active  imagination  of  another  possible  future through artistic installations. This article cautions that garbage art may both open and close off creative and imaginative spaces for \ntransformation  to  a  liberated  society.  Differentiating  between  two  categories of art installations, this article explores how installations can  reflect  back  to  us  our  complicated  relationship  with  waste  and  consumer  culture,  raising  questions  as  to  how  the  aesthetic  realm  might serve as a springboard for critique of capitalism", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Sarah Surak [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Installation art; trash art", "Sumber": "New Political ScieNce, 2016 Vol . 38, N o. 4, 533\u2013546", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Feb 2019"}
