{"Nomor": 36044, "Judul": "Buoyancy effect on shallow tunnels", "Abstrak": "When a shallow tunnel is excavated, an overall upward movement appears as a result of the weight removal from\nthe excavation. This movement is analogous to buoyancy. When numerical simulation of shallow tunnels is used,\nthe magnitude of the upward movement increases with the depth of the lower boundary, defined as the distance\nfrom the tunnel center to the bottom of the mesh. This seems counterintuitive, and yet it is mathematically\ncorrect. This paper investigates the influence of the assumptions made to model the buoyancy phenomenon\nnumerically, and specifically the (typical) plane strain and elasticity assumptions. Three-dimensional and twodimensional plane strain numerical models are carried out using a linear elastic model, where the influence of\nthe ground stiffness increasing with depth is assessed. The results show that the buoyancy effect, i.e. increasing\nupwards movements with depth of the lower boundary, decreases when the ground stiffness increases with\ndepth", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Osvaldo P.M.
