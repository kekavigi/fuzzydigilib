{"Nomor": 38438, "Judul": "Fabrication of Metal Nanowires in Carbon Nanotubes via Versatile Nano-Template Reaction", "Abstrak": "Novel two-dimensional (2D) porous metal oxides with micro-/nanoarchitecture have been successfully fabricated\nusing graphene oxide (GO) as a typical sacrificial template. GO as a 2D template ensures that the growth and fusion of metal\noxides nanoparticles is restricted in the 2D plane. A series of metal oxides (NiO, Fe2O3, Co3O4, Mn2O3, and NiFe2O4) with\nsimilar nanostructure were investigated using this simple method. Some of these special nanostructured materials, such as NiO,\nwhen being used as anode for lithium-ion batteries, can exhibit high specific capacity, good rate performance, and cycling stability.\nImportantly, this strategy of creating a 2D porous micro/nano architecture can be easily extended to controllably synthesize\nother binary/polynary metal oxides nanostructures for lithium-ion batteries or other applications.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Hailiang Cao 1.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/169716"}, "Penulis": "Hailiang Cao, [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xufeng Zhou,Chao Zheng,Zhaoping Liu*"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "graphene metal oxides two dimensional nanostructure lithium-ion battery", "Sumber": "www.acsami.org", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Mei 2019"}
