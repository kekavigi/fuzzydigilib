The current study is concerned with the\nanalysis of magnetic and gravity data aiming to evaluate the subsurface structure of the basement rocks.\nThe aeromagnetic and gravity methods of prospecting give an effective presentation of the subsurface\nstructures. The aeromagnetic data was corrected and represented by total aeromagnetic intensity map\nthen was reduced to the north magnetic pole. The corrected gravity data is represented by Bouguer\nanomaly map. The filtering techniques were applied to the corrected aeromagnetic and gravity maps\nto obtain the residual component caused by local structures and anomalies bodies. The integration of\nradially power spectrum was applied on both magnetic and gravity to estimate the depths of the shallow\nsources and the deep sources. The equivalent depths of the isolated short wavelength anomalies are 0.5\nkm and 0.4 km, and the depths of the long wavelength anomalies are 3.5 and 3 km for the magnetic and\ngravity data, respectively. The Euler deconvolution and 3-D modeling were applied to magnetic and gravity\ndata. The 3-D Euler deconvolution is used not only to delineate major subsurface structures but also to\ndetermine the structural indices of them as well as the average depth of the magnetic and gravity sources.\nThe calculated structural indices show that the area is mainly affected by contacts/thin sheet and the estimated\ndepth of magnetic and gravity sources ranged between 500 m and 2000 m, also the 3-D Euler\ndeconvolution showed that the area was affected by different fault trends such as NNE-SSW, NW-SE\nand E-W trends. The results of 3-D magnetic and gravity interpretation revealed that the depth of basement\nwas ranging from 2500 m to 3000 m .The main tectonic deformations of the area of study have\nNNE-SSW, NW-SE and E-W trends.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Sultan Awad Sultan Araffa  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mohamed El-bohoty, Abou Heleika M., Mahmoud Mekkawi, E.
