{"Nomor": 37542, "Judul": "Hybridized Guided-Mode Resonances via Colloidal Plasmonic Self-Assembled Grating", "Abstrak": "For many photonic applications, it is important to confine light of aspecific wavelength at a certain volume of interest at low losses. So far, it is onlypossible to use the polarized light perpendicular to the solid grid lines to excitewaveguide?plasmon polaritons in a waveguide-supported hybrid structure. In ourwork, we use a plasmonic grating fabricated by colloidal self-assembly and anultrathin injection layer to guide the resonant modes selectively. We use goldnanoparticles self-assembled in a linear template on a titanium dioxide (TiO2) layerto study the dispersion relation with conventional ultraviolet?visible?near-infraredspectroscopic methods. Supported withfinite-difference in time-domainsimulations, we identify the optical band gaps as hybridized modes: plasmonicand photonic resonances. Compared to metallic grids, the observation range ofhybridized guided modes can now be extended to modes along the nanoparticlechain lines. With future applications in energy conversion and opticalfiltersemploying these cost-efficient and upscalable directed self-assembly methods, wediscuss also the application in refractive index sensing of the particle-based hybridized guided modes.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Swagato_Sarkar_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164916"}, "Penulis": "Swagato Sarkar [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Vaibhav Gupta,Mohit Kumar, Jonas Schubert, Patrick T.
