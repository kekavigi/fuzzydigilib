{"Nomor": 37772, "Judul": "Fracturing evolution analysis of Beishan granite under true triaxial compression based on acoustic emission and strain energy", "Abstrak": "The study of rock fracturing is a fundamental research topic in rock mechanics and engineering. In this paper,\nbased on complete stress\u2013strain curves obtained under TTC and the corresponding AE and strain energy results,\nthe mechanical properties and fracturing process of Beishan granite are studied. A representative test result\n(?2 = 75 MPa, ?3 = 20 MPa) is selected to analyse and illustrate the three-dimensional fracturing process of the\nBeishan granite. The results show that the variations in the characteristics of the brittle fracture behaviour, AE\nand strain energy of Beishan granite change with ?2 or ?3 following certain relationships, and the mechanisms\ndriving these various relationships are very different. The AE and strain energy characteristics of Beishan granite\nare also quite different among the five fracturing evolution stages. The variations in the increments of AE count,\nAE event and total elastic strain energy per unit time (?Sc/?t, ?Se/?t and ?Ue/?t) are studied at different times\nand under different stresses during rock failure. The rock fracturing evolution can be illustrated through the\nvariation in these parameters, providing deep insight. This research provides a perspective for studying deep\nunderground fracture-forming processes, such as earthquakes, tunnel sudden failure, spalling, splitting and\nrockburst.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yan Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xia-Ting Feng, Chengxiang Yang , Xiwei Zhang , Mostafa Sharifzadeh , Zhaofeng Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Fracturing process, Acoustic emission, Strain energy, Beishan granite, True triaxial compression", "Sumber": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrmms.2019.03.029", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani \u00a0\n                                     Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "16 Apr 2019"}
