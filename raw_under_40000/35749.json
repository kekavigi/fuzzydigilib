{"Nomor": 35749, "Judul": "UNIVERSAL HALL RESPONSE IN INTERACTING QUANTUM SYSTEMS", "Abstrak": "We theoretically study the Hall effect on interacting M-leg ladder systems, comparing different measures\nand properties of the zero temperature Hall response in the limit of weak magnetic fields. Focusing on SU\u00f0M\u00de symmetric interacting bosons and fermions, as relevant for, e.g., typical synthetic dimensional quantum gas experiments, we identify an extensive regime in which the Hall imbalance?H is universal and corresponds to a classical Hall resistivityRH \u00bc ?1=n for a large class of quantum phases.Away fromthis high symmetry point we observe interaction driven phenomena such as sign reversal and divergence of the Hall response.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SEBASTIAN GRESCHNER [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["MICHELE FILIPPONE,", "AND THIERRY GIAMARCHI"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 122, 083402 (2019); \u00a9 2019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Mar 2019"}
