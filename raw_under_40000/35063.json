{"Nomor": 35063, "Judul": "Learning From A Carbon Dioxide Capture System Dataset: Application Of The Piecewise Neural Network Algorithm", "Abstrak": "This paper presents the application of a neural network rule extraction algorithm, called the piecewise linear artificial neural network or PWL-ANN algorithm, on a carbon capture process system\ndataset. The objective of the application is to enhance understanding of the intricate relationships\namong the key process parameters. The algorithm extracts rules in the form of multiple linear\nregression equations by approximating the sigmoid activation functions of the hidden neurons in\nan artificial neural network (ANN). The PWL-ANN algorithm overcomes the weaknesses of the\nstatistical regression approach, in which accuracies of the generated predictive models are often not\nsatisfactory, and the opaqueness of the ANN models. The results show that the generated PWL-ANN\nmodels have accuracies that are as high as the originally trained ANN models of the four datasets of\nthe carbon capture process system. An analysis of the extracted rules and the magnitude of the\ncoefficients in the equations revealed that the three most significant parameters of the CO2 production rate are the steam flow rate through reboiler, reboiler pressure, and the CO2 concentration\nin the flue gas.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Veronica Chan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Christine Chan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Carbon dioxide capture process system, Artificial neural network, Rule extractions, Non-linear modeling, Linear regression", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 3, Issue 1, Pages 52-67 (March 2017)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Feb 2019"}
