{"Nomor": 35402, "Judul": "IMPROVING STUDENT UNDERSTANDING OF CORRECTIONS TO THE ENERGY SPECTRUMOF THE HYDROGEN ATOM FOR THE ZEEMAN EFFECT", "Abstrak": "We discuss an investigation of student difficulties with the corrections to the energy spectrum of the\nhydrogen atom for the intermediate field Zeeman effect using degenerate perturbation theory (DPT). The\ninvestigation was carried out in advanced quantum mechanics courses by administering free-response and multiple-choice questions and conducting individual interviews with students. We find that students share many common difficulties related to relevant physics concepts. They had difficulty with mathematical sense making in this context of quantum mechanics, which requires the ability to interpret the implications of the degeneracy in the unperturbed energy spectrum and how the Zeeman perturbation will impact the splitting of the energy levels. Many of the common student difficulties arise from challenges in mathematical sense making and applying linear algebra concepts incorrectly in this novel context of quantum mechanics. We describe how the research on student difficulties was used as a guide to develop and evaluate a Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorial (QuILT), which strives to help students develop a functional understanding of the concepts necessary for finding the corrections to the energy spectrum of the hydrogen atom for the intermediate field Zeeman effect using the DPT. We also discuss the development and validation of the DPT QuILT focusing on these issues and its in-class evaluation in the undergraduate and graduate courses.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "CHRISTOF KEEBAUGH [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["EMILY MARSHMAN,", "AND CHANDRALEKHA SINGH"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH 15, 010113 (2019); Published by the American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Feb 2019"}
