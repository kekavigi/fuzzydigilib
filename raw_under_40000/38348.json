{"Nomor": 38348, "Judul": "A values-based approach to heritage planning: raising awareness of the dark side of destruction and conservation", "Abstrak": "Values and a values-based approach to management and decision-making processes over cultural\nheritage are explored and critically reviewed. It is argued that a broader range of values, particularly\nthose emanating from the \u2018dark side\u2019, should be accommodated into future values-based theory and\npractice if decisions are to be more comprehensive and transparent. The paper underlines the necessity\nfor those working with cultural heritage, including within the arena of statutory land-use planning, to\nengage more deeply with cross-disciplinary and international perspectives on heritage values.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Andrew McClelland [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Deborah Peel, Christa-Maria Lerm Hayes and Ian Montgomery"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "values, heritage, planning, destruction, conservation", "Sumber": "https://search.proquest.com/docview/1448508632/fulltextPDF/FDE5F689D0444337PQ/15?accountid=31562", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Mei 2019"}
