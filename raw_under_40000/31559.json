{"Nomor": 31559, "Judul": "A NEW SIMULATION OPPORTUNITY INDEX BASED SOFTWARE TO OPTIMIZE VERTICAL WELL PLACEMENTS", "Abstrak": "Profitability of investment projects for oil or gas field development is dropping drastically in the period of low oil prices . The ability to cost-effectively achieve highest recovery of the field makes good business sense whether the oil prices is high or low. The profitability of a project highly depends on the effectiveness of the field development scenario which is related to the selection of well locations. The appropriate well locations would yield maximum sweep efficiency and recovery. Generally, engineers are still using the conventional trial and error method to determine well location by manually looking for the highest recovery after performing reservoir simulations. Thus, this conventional method which requires intuitive reservoir engineering diagnosis could be highly time and cost consuming process. \n\nTo overcome these issues, a new software program \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u201cSOI Tool\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u201d has been developed to optimize the selection of appropriate well locations based on Simulation Opportunity Index (SOI). SOI is an intelligent method to identify zones with high potential to production, which with conventional reservoir engineering often represents cost-effectiveness and time consuming problems. The producer potential of an area is empirically calculated based on basic rock and fluid properties and reservoir pressure as its energy capacity. By applying SOI into this compact software, it is possible to rank a number of best layers in each X-Y location vertically resulting the appropriate vertical well locations of multilayer reservoirs. \n\nIn order to obtain best results, the original SOI formula (Molina et al., 2009) has been modified into the new SOI formula for oil field and gas field. Hence, the developed software can be applied either for a green oil field or gas field. Furthermore, for infill purposes of a mature field, the developed software has also a competency to consider existing wells effect. This paper shows the success of developed software in obtaining the optimal solution with better accuracy in resulting highest recovery and indeed with less time and less effort than the conventional trial and error method.", "Daftar File": {"2015 TA PP WARDANA SAPUTRA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/141750"}, "Penulis": "WARDANA SAPUTRA (NIM : 12211031)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Prof. Ir.
