{"Nomor": 36187, "Judul": "Affection Mechanism Research Of Initiation Crack Pressure Of Perforation Parameters Of Horizontal Well", "Abstrak": "Horizontal wells show better affect and higher success rate in low water ratio cement, complex\nfracture zone, crevice and heavy oil blocks, it is the main measures to expand control area of a\nsingle well. Hydraulic fracturing technology is the most financial way to improve the penetration of\nthe reservoir to increase the production. However, compare with the vertical wells, the fracture of\nHorizontal wells are more complex, and lead to the initiation crack pressure is much higher than\nvertical wells. In this paper, defined the crack judging basis, and established the finite element\nmodel which could compute the initial crack pressure, to research the affection mechanism of\nperforation azimuth angle, density, diameter and depth, to provide references of perforation project's design and optimize. The research of this paper has significances on further understanding\nthe affection mechanism of perforation parameters", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hua Tong [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ningning Wang, Liangliang Dong, Xiaohua Zhu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Horizontal well, Perforation parameter, Initiation crack pressure, Crack mechanism", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 3, Pages 282-288 (September  2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Mar 2019"}
