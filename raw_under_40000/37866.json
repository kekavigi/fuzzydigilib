{"Nomor": 37866, "Judul": "Writing Storyboards in Pharmaceutical,   Device, and Other Scientific Settings", "Abstrak": "Storyboarding is a highly effective multimedia technique that communicates information by \u201ctelling a story.\u201d1,2 The approach was originally developed by Walt Disney in the early days of animated film and continues to be an important organizational and production tool in the film industry.1,3,4 Perhaps  the earliest storyboards appeared on cave walls where our ancestors used drawings to tell legends, record events, and teach social values.1,5 Today, the storyboard has evolved technologically and has taken on a variety of formats, including animations and videos, to accommodate different clients and target audiences. \nStoryboarding is frequently used by the drug and device industries, because it can be applied to a wide audience using a variety of media types. It is used to train and educate the sales and marketing forces, as well as to provide information to the public sector. Its format easily allows modification of learning materials specific to each audience, as well as dissemination through media, such as \nCD-ROM, DVD, and the Web.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Carol A.
