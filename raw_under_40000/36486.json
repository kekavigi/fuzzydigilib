{"Nomor": 36486, "Judul": "Two innovative pore pressure calculation methods for shallow deep-water formations", "Abstrak": "There are many geological hazards in shallow formations associated with oil and gas exploration and development in deep-water settings. Abnormal pore pressure can lead to water flow and gas and gas hydrate accumulations, which may affect drilling safety. Therefore, it is of great importance to accurately predict pore pressure in\nshallow deep-water formations. Experience over previous decades has shown, however, that there are not appropriate pressure calculation methods for these shallow formations. Pore pressure change is reflected closely\nin log data, particularly for mudstone formations. In this paper, pore pressure calculations for shallow formations\nare highlighted, and two concrete methods using log data are presented. The first method is modified from an E.\nPhilips test in which a linear-exponential overburden pressure model is used. The second method is a new pore\npressure method based on P-wave velocity that accounts for the effect of shallow gas and shallow water flow.\nAfterwards, the two methods are validated using case studies from two wells in the Yingqiong basin. Calculated\nresults are compared with those obtained by the Eaton method, which demonstrates that the multi-regression\nmethod is more suitable for quick prediction of geological hazards in shallow layers", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Song Deng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Honghai Fan, Yuhan Liu, Yanfeng He, Shifeng Zhang, Jing Yang, Lipei Fu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Pore pressure Shallow formation Deep-water Multi-regression", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 146 (2017) 208\u2013213, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.09.014", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Mar 2019"}
