Customers  (N =  166)  were  approached  randomly  with  a  \nrequest to complete our survey as they finished shopping at a convenience store in Taiwan in \nAugust  2014.  The  results  revealed  that  the  purchase  intention  behavior  relied  on  consumer  \ninertia,  which  increased  when  consumers  were  confused  because  they  were  less  capable  of  \nmaking rational buying decisions when choosing between retailer brands in the marketplace. \nIn a marketing campaign context, our findings show that substantial differentiation is crucial \nfor convenience store chains to strengthen the belief system and behavioral routines of their \ncustomers,  thereby  helping  the  convenience  stores  to  strengthen  their  brand  image,  build  \nconsumer trust, achieve a competitive advantage, and capture a greater share of the market in \nboth the short and long term", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "JERRY  YUWEN  SHIU [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["SHIAN -YANG  TZENG"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "inertia,  consumer  confusion,  purchase  intention,  purchase  decision,  consumer   decision making.", "Sumber": "SOCIAL BEHAVIOR AND PERSONALITY, 2018,  46 (3), 387\u2013394", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Mei 2019"}
