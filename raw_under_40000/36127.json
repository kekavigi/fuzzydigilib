{"Nomor": 36127, "Judul": "Comparison of Blood?Brain Barrier Models forin VitroBiologicalAnalysis: One-Cell Type vs Three-Cell Type", "Abstrak": "Different types ofin vitroblood?brain barrier(BBB) models have been constructed and applied for drugtransport to evaluate the efficacy of nanocarrier-based drugdelivery. However, the effectiveness of different types of BBBmodels has not been reported. In this paper, we developedtwo types ofin vitromodels: a one-cell type BBB modeldeveloped using only endothelial cells and a three-cell typeBBB model obtained by coculturing endothelial, pericyte, andastrocyte cells. The nanoparticle transport mechanismsthrough the BBB and transport  efficiencies of theLactoferrin-attached silica nanoparticles were studied usingboth types of thein vitroBBB models. Compared with theone-cell type model, the PSi-Lf NPs exhibit relatively lower transport efficiency across the three-cell type BBB model. However,the effects of the nanoparticle size on the transport efficacies are consistent for both models. For both types of BBB models, thetransport efficacies of the NPs are size-dependent, and the highest efficacies are achieved for PSi-Lf NPs with 25 nm in diameter.Our experimental results indicate that the one-cell type and three-cell type BBB models are equivalent for evaluating andoptimizing nanoparticle transport across the BBB.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Yang_Song_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/161655"}, "Penulis": "Yang Song [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiaoli Cai,Dan Du,Prashanta Dutta,Yuehe Lin"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "Lactoferrin-attached silica nanoparticles, blood?brain barrier, one-cell type, three-cell type, transcytosis", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
