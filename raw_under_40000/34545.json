{"Nomor": 34545, "Judul": "Efficient COD reduction from sulfide minerals processing wastewater using Fenton process", "Abstrak": "This paper presents an efficient COD reduction from sulfide minerals processing wastewater using Fenton process, and the COD of the tailings dam wastewater is largely reduced from 130 mg/L to 30 mg/L, so as to meet the\nemission limit (COD < 60 mg/L). The effects of multiple parameters influencing the Fenton process on COD of\nthe concentrates wastewater, such as reaction time, reaction pH, and H2O2/Fe2+ molar ratio were evaluated in\ndetail. The mechanism of COD reduction was investigated by equilibrium speciation modelling and total organic\ncarbon (TOC) analysis. TOC analysis shows that it is difficult for the Fenton process to oxidize all of the organics\nin wastewater to CO2. Pilot-scale tests were further carried out to confirm the results of the laboratory tests.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xiangsong Meng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sultan Ahmed Khoso.,Jiangqiu Wu.,Mengjie Tian.,, Jianhua Kang.,, Hang Liu.,Qingpeng Zhang.,Wei Sun.,Yuehua Hu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "COD Minerals processing wastewater Fenton process", "Sumber": "Minerals Engineering 132 (2019) 110\u2013112", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Feb 2019"}
