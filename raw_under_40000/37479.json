The aim of this study was to examine the current situation in different ecosystems by researching the aesthetical variety in three types of landscapes present in the territory of Latvia, namely, in rural, periurban and urban ecosystems. The research was carried out from 2010 to 2012. The ecosystems in four old watermills territories were explored in rural landscapes. The periurban landscapes were investigated according to four areas including ecosystems of private housing villages. Urban landscapes were explored by comparing the ecosystems of four public parks. According to the research approaches and based on previously developed criteria, the research reflected both diverse and similar characteristics of landscape aesthetics in different ecosystems.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lilita Lazd?ne [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Maija Jankevica, Daiga Zigmunde"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Latvian landscape, watermills, urban parks, private housing villages, assessing approaches of landscape aesthetics.", "Sumber": "Vilniaus Gedimino technikos universitetas http://www.mla.vgtu.lt ; https://search.proquest.com/results/7525FC7F2A9741C4PQ/1?accountid=31562", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Mar 2019"}
