An  empty  chair at the natural optical centre of Degas\u2019s \nDance  Foyer  of  the  Opera  at  rue  le  Peletier(1872),  occupied  by  a  fan  and  a  puddle  of  \nwhite  cloth.  It  is  waiting  \u2013  and  the  viewer  is  waiting,  subliminally  \u2013  for  its  occupant  to  return  and  claim  the  fan.  It  is  reserved.  Someone has bagged it. Not a circumstance you   often   see   painted,   though   common   enough in real life. Nor is the violinist playing.  He  is  pausing,  his  bow  at  rest  on  his  trouser  leg.  Degas  has  painted  a  pause.  A  thing that hasn\u2019t been painted before. In the same  picture,  a  dancer  to  the  right,  in  the  foreground,  is  sitting  on  another  chair,  her  legs  stiffly  out  front  \u2013  ungainly  yet  graceful, resting. The upright back of the chair is invisible because it is under her unmanage ably  stiff  tulle  skirt,  lifting  the  skirt  up  and  slightly  out  of  alignment.  All  her  fatigue  is  there in the mistake, the carelessness of her plonking  down.  (The  tulle  in  this  picture,  by the way, is a miracle: done not in the easier pastel, with its naturally smudgy, suggestive  cloudiness, but  in  oil  paint, using  the  texture of the fine linencanvas.)", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Craig Raine [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Impressionism, art", "Sumber": "New Statesman. 3/6/2015, Vol. 144 Issue 5252, p54-57. 4p. 1 Color Photograph, 1 Black and White Photograph.", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Mar 2019"}
