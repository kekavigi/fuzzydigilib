{"Nomor": 37445, "Judul": "An Extremely Inexpensive, Simple, and Flexible Carbon FiberElectrode for Tunable Elastomeric Piezo-Resistive Sensors andDevices Realized by LSTM RNN", "Abstrak": "Here, we describe the utility of a carbonfiber (CF)electrode that is inexpensive, simple, andflexible and can be embeddedwith elastomeric nanocomposite piezo-resistive sensors fabricated fromsilicone rubber (Ecoflex) blended with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) andvarious wt % of silicone thinner to tune the sensitivity and softness range.The performance of the CF electrode was evaluated on the basis ofpiezo-resistive responses fromthe sensors subjected to dynamicsinusoidal compressive strains at different levels and frequencies. Theresponses were positive-pressure effects with rate-dependent asymmetricnonlinear hysteresis characteristics. Developing a mathematical model todescribe the rate-dependent asymmetric nonlinear hysteresis behavior istechnically impossible; therefore, we employed artificial intelligence-based hysteresis modeling, long short-term memoryrecurrent neural network, to describe the hysteresis nonlinearity. The debonding strength of the CF electrode was determinedin the pull-offtesting and was found to be much higher than that of a copper wire electrode. The debonding mechanism wasfurther elucidated via an in situ resistance profile. The importance of a robust conductive interface between a CF electrode and ananocomposite was experimentally demonstrated. It was found that the inherent piezo-resistance of the CF was negligiblecompared with the piezo-resistance of the sensor; therefore, the signals from the sensor were free of interference. We believeCF-embedded tunable piezo-resistive sensors could be used in biomedical devices, artificial e-skins, robotic touch applications,andflexible keyboards where the required stretchability of the electrode can be introduced via an appropriate geometricaldesign", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Min-Young_Cho_2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164467"}, "Penulis": "Min-Young Cho [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jeong Heon Lee,Seong-Hoon Kim,Ji Sik Kim,Timilsina"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "unable piezo-resistive sensor, carbonfiber electrode, positive-pressure-effect, artificial intelligence, nonlinear hysteresis,conductive interface", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
