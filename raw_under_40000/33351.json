{"Nomor": 33351, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT AND TEST OF THE SOFTWARE  FOR THE FLIGHT CONTROL PANEL OF LSA-02 TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATOR AIRCRAFT", "Abstrak": "The Flight Control Panel (FCP) is the interface for safety pilots and the Electronic Flight Control System (EFCS). The FCP display informs the safety pilot about active and available automatic modes, status of system error, and the aircraft flight state. The safety critical information that the pilot enter on FCP is to be forwarded directly to the Flight Control Computer (FCC) and mirrored to the FCP display. it must be ensured that the FCC correctly understood pilot commands before the pilot confirms its execution. \nDevelopment and test of the software for the FCP are conducted according to the V-model. The process of FCP software development is started with the requirements specification, continued with the software design and ended with the integration and verification of the FCP software design. \nThe design of FCP software consists of serial handling which has purposes of handling serial communication, CAN handling is to handle the CAN communication, and GUI handling is to handle the GUI or layout of FCP software display. The conclusions from the thesis are the development of FCP software has been completed and the FCP software meets all the requirements", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Adi Wirawan [23615016]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Toto Indriyanto, Ph.D., Rianto Adhy Sasongko, Ph.D., Prof. Dr.-ing.
