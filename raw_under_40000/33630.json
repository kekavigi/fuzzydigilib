{"Nomor": 33630, "Judul": "Accelerated Materials Discovery Using Chemical Informatics Investigation of Polymer Physicochemical Properties and Transgene Expression Efficacy", "Abstrak": ": Quantitative approaches to structure?property relationships are critical for the accelerated design and discovery\nof biomaterials in biotechnology and medicine. However, the absence of definitive structures, unlike those available for small\nmolecules or 3D crystal structures available for some proteins, has limited the development of Quantitative Structure?Property\nRelationship (QSPR) models for investigating physicochemical properties and biological activity of polymers. In this study, we\ndescribe a combined experimental and cheminformatics paradigm for first developing QSPR models of polymer\nphysicochemical properties, including molecular weight, hydrophobicity, and DNA-binding activity. Quantitative Structure?\nActivity Relationship (QSAR) models of polymer-mediated transgene expression were then developed using these\nphysicochemical properties with an eye towards developing a novel two-step chemical informatics paradigm for determining\nbiological activity (e.g., transgene expression) of polymer properties as related to physicochemical properties. We also\ninvestigated a more conventional approach in which biomaterial efficacy, i.e., transgene expression activity, was directly\ncorrelated to structural representations of the polymers used for delivering plasmid DNA. Our generalized chemical informatics\napproach can accelerate the discovery of polymeric biomaterials for several applications in biotechnology and medicine,\nincluding in nucleic acid delivery", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zhuo Zhen [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Thrimoorthy Potta.,?
