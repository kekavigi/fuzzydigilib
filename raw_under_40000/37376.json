This\nthree-component coupling reaction in acetonitrile provides\n2-imino thiazolines, whereas the formation of 2-thioxoimidazolin-\n4-ones was observed under basic conditions at ambient\ntemperature. The corresponding products were obtained in\ngood to excellent yield with broad substrate scope. Isolation of\nthiourea and thiohydantoin intermediates disclosed the course of the reaction mechanism.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Indrajeet J.
