Drive Sequential Steps of the Toxic Pathway", "Abstrak": "While the roles of intrinsically disordered\nprotein domains in driving interprotein interactions are\nincreasingly well-appreciated, the mechanism of toxicity of\ndisease-causing disordered proteins remains poorly understood.\nA prime example is Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD)\nassociated amyloid beta (A?). A? oligomers are highly toxic\npartially structured peptide assemblies with a distinct ordered\nregion (residues ?10?40) and a shorter disordered region\n(residues ?1?9). Here, we investigate the role of this\ndisordered domain and its relation to the ordered domain in\nthe manifestation of toxicity through a set of A? fragments\nand stereoisomers designed for this purpose...", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Barun Kumar Maity [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Anand Kant Das, Simli Dey, Ullhas Kaarthi Moorthi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Intracellular amyloid beta, Amyloid beta fragment, Amyloid beta interactions, Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), amyloid-membrane interaction, amyloid enantiomer", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan \u00a0\n                                     Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Mar 2019"}
