{"Nomor": 33622, "Judul": "FIRST-PRINCIPLES PLASMA SIMULATIONS OF BLACK-HOLE JET LAUNCHING", "Abstrak": "Black holes drive powerful plasma jets to relativistic velocities. This plasma should be collisionless, and\nself-consistently supplied by pair creation near the horizon. We present general-relativistic collisionless\nplasma simulations of Kerr-black-hole magnetospheres which begin from vacuum, inject e pairs based on\nlocal unscreened electric fields, and reach steady states with electromagnetically powered Blandford-\nZnajek jets and persistent current sheets. Particles with negative energy at infinity are a general feature, and can contribute significantly to black-hole rotational-energy extraction in a variant of the Penrose process. The generated plasma distribution depends on the pair-creation environment, and we describe two distinct realizations of the force-free electrodynamic solution. This sensitivity suggests that plasma kinetics will be useful in interpreting future horizon-resolving submillimeter and infrared observations.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "KYLE PARFREY   [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["ALEXANDER PHILIPPOV,", "AND BENO\u00ceT CERUTTI"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 122, 035101 (2019); \u00a9 2019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Jan 2019"}
