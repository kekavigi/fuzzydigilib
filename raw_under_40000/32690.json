{"Nomor": 32690, "Judul": "Study on the Strength Development of Cemented Backfill Body from Lead-Zinc Mine Tailings with Sulphide", "Abstrak": "*e unconfined compressive strength (UCS) development of cemented backfill materials for lead-zinc mine tailings with sulphide\nwas studied. *e results showed that the UCS of the cemented backfill body with ordinary Portland cement (OPC) as binder\ndecreased in the later curing days, regardless of particle size. Under the same conditions, the higher the OPC content, the higher\nthe UCS of the cemented backfill body, and the UCS of the cemented backfill body began to decrease at the longer curing days.\nUnder the same conditions, the finer the tailings, the lower the UCS of the cemented backfill body at each age, and the UCS of the\ncemented backfill body began to decrease at the earlier curing age. X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) showed that the reduction of\nthe UCS of the cemented backfill body was related to the formation of an expansive substance (expansive gypsum) in the cemented\nbackfill body, which led to the cracking of the test sample. In the cemented backfill materials of coarse tailings of lead-zinc mine,\nthe composite binder formed by OPC and calcined kaolin (CK) containing metakaolin was used; the amount of calcium hydroxide, the hydration product of cement, was reduced or eliminated due to the pozzolanic reaction of metakaolin; and the\namount of expansive gypsum was reduced or eliminated, so the UCS of the cemented backfill body increased within 360 days\nof curing.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Juanrong Zheng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Lijie Guo", "Xiaoxiao Sun", "Wenchen Li", "and Qi Jia"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Metallurgy", "Kata Kunci": "compressive strength", "Sumber": "Advances in Materials Science and Engineering Volume 2018, Article ID 7278014, 8 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/7278014", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani \u00a0\n                                     Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Des 2018"}
