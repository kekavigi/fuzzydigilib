{"Nomor": 34844, "Judul": "Coordinated management of combined sewer overflows by means of environmental decision support systems", "Abstrak": "During heavy rainfall, the capacity of sewer systems and wastewater treatment plants may be surcharged producing uncontrolled wastewater discharges and a depletion of the environmental quality. Therefore there is a\nneed of advanced management tools to tackle with these complex problems. In this paper an environmental decision support system (EDSS), based on the integration of mathematical modeling and knowledge-based systems, has been developed for the coordinated management of urban wastewater systems (UWS) to control\nand minimize uncontrolled wastewater spills. Effectiveness of the EDSS has been tested in a specially designed\nvirtual UWS, including two sewers systems, two WWTP and one river subjected to typical Mediterranean rain\nconditions. Results show that sewer systems, retention tanks and wastewater treatment plants improve their\nperformance under wet weather conditions and that EDSS can be very effective tools to improve the management and prevent the system from possible uncontrolled wastewater discharges.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Damian Murla [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Oriol Gutierrez., Montse Martinez .,David Su\u00f1er.,Pere Malgrat., Manel Poch"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Environmental decision support systems Coordinated management Combined sewer overflows Urban wastewater systems", "Sumber": "Science of the Total Environment 550 (2016) 256\u2013264", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Feb 2019"}
