However, the traditional dispersion\nmeasurements of multi-channel seismic data are usually based on linear signal comparison and achieve a\nlow resolution at low frequencies. To improve the accuracy of surface-wave dispersion measurement for\nmulti-channel seismic data,we propose a novel measurement that can produce a high and adjustable resolution\namong a wide detected frequency range. This measurement is based on a nonlinear signal comparison using\nmulti-channel seismic data.We evaluated the performance of this proposed multi-channel nonlinear signal comparison\n(MNLSC) on several datasets: one synthetic shotgather containing only surface waves, one synthetic\nshotgather with full elastic waves, and one field shotgather. These examples show that the MNLSC is promising\nto be a reliable and effective tool for measuring the surface dispersion from the multi-channel seismic data.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hao Hu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mustafa Senkaya, Yingcai Zheng"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Multi-channel High resolution Dispersion measurement Surface-wave inversion", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 160 (2019) 236\u2013241, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.11.015", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Feb 2019"}
