{"Nomor": 34479, "Judul": "THREE-DIMENSIONAL FORCE-FIELD MICROSCOPY WITH OPTICALLY LEVITATED MICROSPHERES", "Abstrak": "We report on the use of 4.7-?m-diameter, optically levitated, charged microspheres to image the threedimensional force field produced by charge distributions on an Au-coated, microfabricated Si beam in vacuum. An upward-propagating, single-beam optical trap, combined with an interferometric imaging technique, provides optimal access to the microspheres for microscopy. In this demonstration, the Au-coated surface of the Si beam can be brought as close as ?10 ?m from the center of the microsphere while forces are simultaneously measured along all three orthogonal axes, fully mapping the vector force field over a total volume of ?106 ?m3.We report a force sensitivity of (2.5 \u00b1 1.0) \u00d7 10?17 N/?Hz, in each of the three degrees of freedom, with a linear response to up to ?10?13 N. While we discuss the case of mapping static electric fields using charged microspheres, it is expected that the technique can be extended to other force fields, using microspheres with different properties.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "CHARLES P.
