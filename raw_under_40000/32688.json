{"Nomor": 32688, "Judul": "EVAPORATION-DRIVEN CONVECTIVE FLOWS IN SUSPENSIONS OF NONMOTILE BACTERIA", "Abstrak": "We report a novel form of convection in suspensions of the bioluminescent marine bacterium\nPhotobacterium phosphoreum. Suspensions of these bacteria placed in a chamber\nopen to the air create persistent luminescent plumes most easily visible when observed\nin the dark. These flows are strikingly similar to the classical bioconvection pattern\nof aerotactic swimming bacteria, which create an unstable stratification by swimming\nupwards to an air-water interface, but they are a puzzle since the strain of P. phosphoreum\nused does not express flagella and therefore cannot swim. When microspheres were used\ninstead of bacteria, similar flow patterns were observed, suggesting that the convective\nmotion was not driven by bacteria but instead by the accumulation of salt at the airwater\ninterface due to evaporation of the culture medium. Even at room temperature and\nhumidity, and physiologically relevant salt concentrations, the water evaporation was found\nto be sufficient to drive convection patterns. To prove this hypothesis, experiments were\ncomplemented with a mathematical model that aimed to understand the mechanism of\nplume formation and the role of salt in triggering the instability. The simplified system\nof evaporating salty water was first studied using linear stability analysis, and then with\nfinite element simulations. A comparison between these three approaches is presented.\nWhile evaporation-driven convection has not been discussed extensively in the context of\nbiological systems, these results suggest that the phenomenon may be broadly relevant,\nparticularly in those systems involving microorganisms of limited motility.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "JOCELYN DUNSTAN [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["KYOUNG J.
