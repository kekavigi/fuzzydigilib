He  is  undoubtedly  a  Rimbaud,  a  Verlaine  and  a  C\u00e9zanne  of  music.  The  art  of  this  musical  genre  is  the  art  of  an  unrivalled  unmistakeable  singular  French  spirit  that  happily  and  deally  accomplished  the  triumvirate  in  the  art  by  the  fusion  of  music  with  poetry  and  painting.  The  pianistic  art  of  Debussy  is  to  the  same  extent  the  art  of  the  inner  inspiration  and  intuition. As the composer he stated: \u201cthis music is not learnt but it is felt\u201d in a symphony of nuances  and  colours  and  in  an  improvisation  that  observes  the  rules  of  \u201cthe  order  and  discipline\u201d of the musical grammar in a totally different way than his classical predecessors.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lacramioara Noue [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "The fusion of music with poetry and painting, symphony of nuances and colours", "Sumber": "Bulletin of the Transilvania  University of Bra ? ov \u2013 Supplement  Series VIII: Performing Arts  \u2022 Vol. 8 (57) No. 2 - 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Mar 2019"}
