{"Nomor": 37607, "Judul": "Probability of frame synchronisation failure for binary and complex-valued sequences", "Abstrak": "Several different sequences for frame\nsynchronisation have been published in the literature.\nRecently, even sequences using complex\nsignal alphabets have been specified. Whether\nbinary or complex, they are always chosen according\nto the properties of their autocorrelation function.\nHowever, the probability of being out of\nsynchronisation has not as such been considered\nsufficiently. The paper serves as a compendium\nof derivations of such probability formulas for\nvarious applications and conditions, including\nboth binary and complex signal constellations.\nHard quantisation as well as the continuous case\nare treated.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Werner Henkel [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Peter Keller"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Codes and decoding, Digital communication systems", "Sumber": "IEE PROCEEDING", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Apr 2019"}
