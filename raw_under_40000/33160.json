{"Nomor": 33160, "Judul": "Review Microplastics, a food safety issue?", "Abstrak": "The risk posed by microplastics for human and environment, has become a hot topic. The concern is focused not\nonly on the effect of microplastics as such but also on additives and chemical contaminants absorbed by microplastics that may be released and affect negatively animals and environmental health. Despite several works\nhave been written on this topic, a number of knowledge gaps still should be filled to enable a correct risk\nassessment of this important issue. For example, the relevance of microplastics for food safety has not yet been\nfully established and scientific results aimed at establishing a possible health risk for contaminants associated\nwith microplastics are rather controversial. The risk assessment of microplastics in foodstuff is still at a very early\nstage and very few studies on the monitoring of microplastics in foodstuff and their effects on human health are\navailable. Additionally, it is difficult to compare results from different studies as methodologies and study designs are not uniform. For this reason, it is not always possible to reach some definitive conclusion.\nThis work sets out to complement the reviews and statements already existing, by updating the information\nand identifying if any of the knowledge gaps have been covered and if further ones have been detected with the\nfinal aim of properly assessing and managing this emerging risk.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Sandra Rainieri [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Alejandro Barranco"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Microplastics POPs Toxicity Nanoplastics Risk assessment", "Sumber": "Trends in Food Science & Technology xxx (xxxx) xxx\u2013xxx", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "16 Jan 2019"}
