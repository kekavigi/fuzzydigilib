We evaluated the relationship between exposure to alcohol\nadvertising,  marketing  and  portrayal  on  subsequent  drinking  behaviour  in  young  people  by\nsystematic review of cohort (longitudinal) studies.\nMethods: studies were identified in October 2006 by searches of electronic databases, with no\ndate restriction, supplemented with hand searches of reference lists of retrieved articles. Cohort\nstudies that evaluated exposure to advertising or marketing or alcohol portrayals and drinking at\nbaseline and assessed drinking behaviour at follow-up in young people were selected and reviewed.\nResults: seven cohort studies that followed up more than 13,000 young people aged 10 to 26 years\nold were reviewed. The studies evaluated a range of different alcohol advertisement and marketing\nexposures including print and broadcast media. Two studies measured the hours of TV and music\nvideo viewing. All measured drinking behaviour using a variety of outcome measures. Two studies\nevaluated  drinkers  and  non-drinkers  separately.  Baseline  non-drinkers  were  significantly  more\nlikely  to  have  become  a  drinker  at  follow-up  with  greater  exposure  to  alcohol  advertisements.\nThere was little difference in drinking frequency at follow-up in baseline drinkers. In studies that\nincluded drinkers and non-drinkers, increased exposure at baseline led to significant increased risk\nof drinking at follow-up. The strength of the relationship varied between studies but effect sizes were generally modest. All studies controlled for age and gender, however potential confounding\nfactors  adjusted  for  in  analyses  varied  from  study  to  study.  Important  risk  factors  such  as  peer drinking and parental attitudes and behaviour were not adequately accounted for in some studies.\nConclusion: data  from  prospective  cohort  studies  suggest  there  is  an  association  between\nexposure  to  alcohol  advertising  or  promotional  activity  and  subsequent alcohol  consumption  in\nyoung people. Inferences about the modest effect sizes found are limited by the potential influence\nof residual or unmeasured confounding.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lesley A Smith [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["David R Foxcroft"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Advertising, marketing, behavior", "Sumber": "BMC Public Health. 2009, Vol. 9 Issue 1, p1-11. 11p. 1 Diagram", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Feb 2019"}
