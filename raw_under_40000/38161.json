{"Nomor": 38161, "Judul": "Planning and affordable housing in Australia, New Zealand and England: common culture; different mechanisms", "Abstrak": "This paper compares approaches to planning and delivery of affordable\nhousing across England, Australia and New Zealand. While all three nations began with a\ncommon starting point\u2014early British town planning legislation\u2014underlying differences in\nurban regulation, property rights and housing provision soon emerged. However, signs of\nconvergence have lately re-appeared, as all three countries have responded to affordable\nhousing shortages by exploring new strategies to boost supply through the planning system.\nIn the tradition of comparative housing research, this paper examines these strategies in the\ncontext of each country\u2019s particular historical, socio-cultural, governance and urban\nplanning frameworks. Our analysis shows how differences in planning systems and\napproaches to housing assistance can delimit opportunities to secure new affordable\nhomes, particularly in the context of increasing land values. Effective delivery of\naffordable housing through the planning system depends on consistent and enforceable\npolicy articulation, government commitment, a mature affordable housing sector, and\nparticular market conditions", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Patricia M.
