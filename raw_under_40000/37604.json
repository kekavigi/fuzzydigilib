{"Nomor": 37604, "Judul": "Image sequence coding using adaptive tree-structured vector quantisation with multipath searching", "Abstrak": "In the encoding of image sequences for\ntransmission and storage, the coding algorithm\nmust have the ability to adapt to changing image\ncharacteristics from sequence to sequence and\nfrom frame to frame. A new adaptive treestructured\nvector quantisation (adaptive TSVQ)\nwith multipath searching is described. The structure\nof the codebook tree is reorganised at an\nupdate interval, without requiring any transmission\nof side information. The 1-path tree searching\nalgorithm is a simple method of finding the closest\ncodeword in TSVQ. The disadvantage of 1-path\nsearching is that the selected codewords are not,\nin general, closest to the input vectors. Hence, the\nmultipath searching algorithm is proposed to\nimprove the image quality. The improvement over\nthe fixed TSVQ at the same bit rate is up to\n2.54dB when the number of the leaves in the\ncodebook tree is 256 and 4-path searching is\napplied.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "R.F.
