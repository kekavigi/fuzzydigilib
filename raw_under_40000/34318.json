{"Nomor": 34318, "Judul": "The Perfect Marriage? \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd Language and Art Criticism in the Hong Kong Public Examination Context", "Abstrak": "Art education in Hong Kong has undergone various changes in response to educational reform. In art\nassessment, a major change in the Hong Kong New Senior Secondary (NSS) Curriculum is the inclusion of art criticism as a compulsory component of the new public examination. Assessing students\u2019 abilitiesto interpret art in an art criticism public examination context is a critical issue in Hong Kong because the new senior secondary curriculum and assessment has brought attention to the role of written language in the art examination paper. This means the examination assesses not only students\u2019abilities tointerpret art, but also their language abilities required to respond to art in written form. Since this new mode of assessment of art criticism has been published a number of issues have appeared. Recent studies show that teachers and students perceive this development negatively and they believe that the written format will assess students\u2019 written language abilities rather than their critical abilities. These findings challenge the justification of the new art assessment policy and raise questions about the role of written language in responding to art. This article aims to raise the issue of the marriage between language and art criticism in the Hong Kong public examination context. It argues and examines the relationship of language to art interpretation, reasoning in the assessment, and issues in the public art criticism examination context. The issues addressed in this article provide opportunities for researchers and policy makers to reconsider and \nrefine the new form of examination.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Chung-yim Lau  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Cheung-on Tam"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "art assessment, art criticism, art interpretation, language, public examination", "Sumber": "THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION, 2017", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Feb 2019"}
