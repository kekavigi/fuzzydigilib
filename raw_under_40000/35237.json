{"Nomor": 35237, "Judul": "EXPERIMENTS ON THE LOW-REYNOLDS-NUMBER SETTLINGOF A SPHERE THROUGH A FLUID INTERFACE", "Abstrak": "The low-Reynolds-number gravitational settling of a sphere through a fluid interface\nis investigated experimentally. By varying the viscosity ratio between the two fluids and\nthe Bond number, two different modes of interfacial deformation are observed: a tailing\nmode and a film drainage mode. In the tailing mode, the interface deforms significantly\nas the sphere approaches, and the sphere becomes enveloped by a layer of the upper fluid.\nA tail forms, connecting the sphere to the bulk of the upper phase. In the film drainage\nmode, the interface deforms much less and the sphere impacts onto the interface, which\neither ruptures to form a contact line on the sphere or leaves a very thin wetting film.\nAdditionally, two types of sinking profiles are observed: steady sinking, where the sphere\nvelocity changes monotonically as it sinks, and stalled sinking, where the sphere\u2019s progress\nis inhibited by the interface, before it accelerates into the lower fluid. We present a regime\ndiagram showing the different behaviors. Finally, the dependence of the sinking time on\nthe Bond number and viscosity ratio is investigated. For the film drainage regime a simple\nscaling law is deduced; the tailing regime exhibits more complicated dynamics, possibly\nexplained by a multistage sinking process.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "PAUL A.
