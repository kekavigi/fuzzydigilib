{"Nomor": 33242, "Judul": "BLACK-BOX QUANTUM STATE PREPARATION WITHOUT ARITHMETIC", "Abstrak": "Black-box quantum state preparation is an important subroutine in many quantum algorithms. The\nstandard approach requires the quantum computer to do arithmetic, which is a key contributor to the\ncomplexity. Here we present a new algorithm that avoids arithmetic.We thereby reduce the number of gates\nby a factor of 286\u2013374 over the best prior work for realistic precision; the improvement factor increases\nwith the precision. As quantum state preparation is a crucial subroutine in many approaches to simulating\nphysics on a quantum computer, our new method brings useful quantum simulation closer to reality.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "YUVAL R.
