InterfacesXXXX, XXX, XXX?XXX", "Abstrak": "Silicon is now well-recognized to be apromising alternative anode for advanced lithium-ion batteriesbecause of its highest capacity available today; however, itsinsufficiently high Coulombic efficiency upon cycling remainsa major challenge for practical application. To overcome thischallenge, we have developed a facile mechanochemicalmethod to synthesize a core?shell-structured Si/polypheny-lene composite (Si/PPP) with a n-type conductive PPP layertightly bonded in a planar orientation to the surfaces of Sinanocores. Because of its compactness andflexibility, the outerPPP layer can protect the Si core from contacting the electrolyte and maintaining the structural stability of electrode/electrolyteinterface during cycles. As a result, the Si/PPP anode demonstrated a high reversible capacity of?2387 mAh g?1, a stablecycleability with 88.5% capacity retention over 500 cycles, and, particularly, a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% uponextended cycling, offering a new insight for future development of high-capacity and cycle-stable Si anode.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Jingmin_Zhang_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/165079"}, "Penulis": "Jingmin Zhang, [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sijia Fan,Hui Wang,Jiangfeng Qian,Hanxi Yang,Xinping Ai,and Jincheng Liu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "silicon nanoparticles, lithium-ion batteries, mechanochemical synthesis, Si/polyphenylene composite,N-type conductive polymer", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
