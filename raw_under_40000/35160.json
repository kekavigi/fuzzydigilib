{"Nomor": 35160, "Judul": "Full-scale experimental investigation of the performance of a jet-assisted rotary drilling system in crystalline rock", "Abstrak": "Full-scale drilling experiments (8\u00bd in. bit size) with a high-pressure fluid jet assisted rotary drilling system were\nperformed in hard to drill crystalline rock. Besides the development of novel drill bits and high-pressure components, an existing drilling simulator test bench was adapted to the requirements of the current tests. A total\nnumber of seventeen test runs was conducted to enable a comparison of drilling performance between state of\nthe art drilling technique and the innovative jet assisted system. A significant increase in rate of penetration was\nachieved with the system. Another relevant aspect was the influence of different drilling and jetting fluids on\ndrilling performance. The interaction of the hydraulic and mechanical rock removing processes was researched\nin detail and led to further conclusions about the rock destruction process. Basic and sophisticated correlations\nbetween drilling parameters were examined in order to define the favourable operational parameters for each bit\ntype. Lessons learned during these experiments will directly be integrated in the preparation of later field tests of\nthe enhanced system.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Thomas Stoxreiter [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Thomas Stoxreiter,  Laurent Gerbaud,  Olivier Seibel, Stefan Essl, Johann Plank, Johann Plank"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Drilling technology, Geothermal energy, Rock mechanics, ThermoDrill", "Sumber": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrmms.2019.01.011", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Feb 2019"}
