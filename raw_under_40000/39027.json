{"Nomor": 39027, "Judul": "Conductive Polymer?Inorganic Hybrid Materials through Synergistic Mutual Doping of the Constituents", "Abstrak": "Polymer-matrix-based inorganic?organic hybrid materials are at the cutting edge of current research for\ntheir great promise of merging properties of soft and hard\nsolids in one material. Infiltration of polymers with vapors of\nreactive metal organics is a pathway for postsynthetic blending\nof the polymer with inorganic materials. Here, we show that this process is also an excellent method for fabricating conductive\nhybrid materials. Polyaniline (PANI) was infiltrated with ZnO and the initially insulating polymer was converted to a PANI/ZnO\nhybrid with conductivities as high as 18.42 S/cm. The conductivity is based on a synergistic effect of the constituting materials,\nwhere the inorganic and the polymeric fractions mutually act as dopants for the counterpart. The process temperature is a very\nimportant factor for successful infiltration, and the number of applied infiltration cycles allows tuning the level of conductivity of\nthe resulting PANI/ZnO", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Weike Wang 1.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170857"}, "Penulis": "Weike Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Chaoqiu Chen, Christopher Tollan, Fan Yang,Mikel Beltran, Yong Qin,  Mato Knez"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "multiple pulsed infiltration, synergistic mutual doping, conductive polymer, polyaniline, ZnO, atomic layer deposition", "Sumber": "www.acsami.org  DOI: 10.1021/acsami.7b09270 ACS Appl.
