{"Nomor": 38604, "Judul": "Greener and Sustainable Trends in Synthesis of Organics and Nanomaterials", "Abstrak": "Trends in greener and sustainable process\ndevelopment during the past 25 years are abridged involving\nthe use of alternate energy inputs (mechanochemistry,\nultrasound- or microwave irradiation), photochemistry, and\ngreener reaction media as applied to synthesis of organics and\nnanomaterials. In the organic synthesis arena, examples\ncomprise assembly of heterocyclic compounds, coupling and a\nvariety of other name reactions catalyzed by basic water or\nrecyclable magnetic nanocatalysts. Generation of nanoparticles\nbenefits from the biomimetic approaches where vitamins,\nsugars, and plant polyphenols, including agricultural waste\nresidues, can serve as reducing and capping agents. Metal\nnanocatalysts (Pd, Au, Ag, Ni, Ru, Ce, Cu, etc.) immobilized on\nbiodegradable supports such as cellulose and chitosan, or on recyclable magnetic ferrites via ligands, namely dopamine or\nglutathione, are receiving special attention. These strategic approaches attempt to address most of the Green Chemistry\nPrinciples while producing functional chemicals with utmost level of waste minimization.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Rajender S.
