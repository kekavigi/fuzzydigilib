{"Nomor": 35257, "Judul": "Acclimation of consortium of micro-algae help removal of organic pollutants from meat processing wastewater", "Abstrak": "The purpose of this study was to acclimate and select microalgae species to efficiently remove organic\npollutants from meat processing wastewater while accumulating biomass for further processing. Results\nshowed that C. protothecoides, S. obliquus and C. vulgaris and their consortia presented robust growth in\nsynthesized wastewater. Acclimated S. obliquus, C. vulgaris and C. sorokiniana adapted better to the\nenvironment in wastewater and achieved significantly (P < 0.05) higher biomass than those without\nacclimatization. At the end of the nine-day-treatment period, S. obliquus and its consortium with\nC. vulgaris achieved the highest biomass accumulation (1.7 g/L). However, cultivation periods longer than\nfive days did not significantly (P > 0.05) improve the microalgal removal of chemical oxygen demand\n(COD) and nutrients under conditions evaluated in this study. Results showed that 74% total phosphate\n(TP-PO4\n3-), 52% total nitrogen (TN) and 87% COD were removed from wastewater after five-day microalgae\ntreatment, which was higher than the removal observed in control samples (48% TP-PO4\n3-, 32%TN, 84%\nCOD). Microalgae treatment did not improve COD removal but was able to accelerate the removal rate. A\nconsortium containing three species (S. obliquus \u00fe C. vulgaris \u00fe C. sorokiniana) was assessed to improve\nnutrients and COD removal. The consortium achieved higher removal of COD (91%), TN (67%) and TP-PO4\n3-\n(69%). Therefore, the acclimated consortium of S. obliquus \u00fe C. vulgaris \u00fe C. sorokiniana can be effectively\nused in the treatment of heavily polluted meat processing wastewater as primary or secondary treatment\noption.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xinjuan Hu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yulie E.
