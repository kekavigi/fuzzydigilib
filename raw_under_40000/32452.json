{"Nomor": 32452, "Judul": "How Cross-Linking Mechanisms of Methacrylated Gellan Gum Hydrogels Alter Macrophage Phenotype", "Abstrak": ": In tissue engineering scaffolds, macrophages play\na critical role in determining the host response to implanted\nbiomaterials. Macrophage phenotype is dynamic throughout the\nhost response, and a balance of phenotypes is essential for timely\nprogression from injury to proper wound healing. Therefore, it is\nimportant to predict how materials will modulate the response of\nmacrophages. In this study, we investigated the effect of\nmethacrylated gellan gum (GG) hydrogels on macrophage\nphenotype and proliferation with the ultimate goal of improving\nrational design of biomedical implants. Nai?\nve, along with\nclassically and alternatively activated RAW 264.7 macrophages\nwere seeded on methacrylated gellan gum hydrogels that were\nfabricated with different thiol?ene ratios and cross-linking\nmechanisms. Live/dead assays showed that all hydrogels supported cell attachment and proliferation. Stiffer substrates\nenhanced anti-inflammatory production of nitrites from both nai?\nve and classically activated macrophages compared to the softer\nsubstrates. Moreover, arginine and CD206 expression?markers for alternatively activated macrophages?were inhibited by\nhigher thiol content. Introducing ionic cross-links using calcium did not influence the proliferation or polarization for any of the\nthree macrophage phenotypes. Our results suggest that the macrophage phenotype shift from M1 to M2 is controlled by the\ndifferent cross-linking mechanisms, physical properties, and the chemistry of methacrylated gellan gum hydrogels.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ZHUQING LI  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Kaitlin M.
