However, research has focused on\npopulations in England and mainland Europe. We\nexamined habitat and survey criteria for great crested\nnewts in Scotland, with focus on a large, translocated\npopulation. Adult counts throughout the breeding\nseason were obtained annually using torchlight surveys,\nand Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) assessed at\ncreated ponds (N = 24) in 2006 (immediately posttranslocation)\nand 2015 (9 years post-translocation).\nIn 2006, \u2018best case\u2019 HSI scores were calculated to\npredict habitat suitability should great crested newts\nhave unrestricted access to terrestrial habitat. Abiotic\ncriteria included in and omitted from current great\ncrested newt survey guidelines were assessed using\ndata recorded in 2015. Some ponds had improved HSI\nscores in 2015, but overall failure to meet predicted\nscores suggests management is needed to improve\nhabitat suitability. Great crested newt activity was\npositively associated with moon visibility and phase,\nair temperature, and pH, but negatively correlated with\nwater clarity. Importantly, our results indicate there\nare abiotic determinants specific to Scottish great\ncrested newts. Principally, survey temperature thresholds\nshould be lowered to enable accurate census of\nScottish populations.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "LYNSEY R.
