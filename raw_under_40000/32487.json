{"Nomor": 32487, "Judul": "Effect of Seepage Velocity on Formation of Shaft Frozen Wall in Loose Aquifer", "Abstrak": "'is paper addresses the difficult closure of a frozen wall in a coal mine shaft due to excessive seepage velocity in an aquifer when\nthe aquifer is penetrated via the artificial freezing method. Based on hydrothermal coupling theory and considering the effect of\ndecreased absolute porosity on seepage during the freezing process, a mathematical model of hydrothermal full-parameter\ncoupling with a phase change is created. A shaft is used as a prototype, and COMSOL multiphysics finite element software is\nemployed to perform a numerical simulation of the shaft freezing process at various stratum seepage velocities. 'e numerical\nsimulation results are verified via a comparison with field measurement data. Based on the numerical simulation results, the\nimpact of various underground water seepage velocities on the artificial frozen wall formation process with the seepagetemperature\nfield coupling effect is analysed. Based on the analysis results, the recommended principles of the optimization design\nfor a freezing plan are described as follows: first, the downstream area is closed to enable the water insulation effect, and second,\nthe closure of the upstream area is expedited to reduce the total closure time of a frozen wall.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "JIAN LIN [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hua Cheng", "Hai-bing Cai", "Bin Tang", "and Guang-yong Cao"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Hydrogeology", "Sumber": "Advances in Materials Science and Engineering Volume 2018, Article ID 2307157, 11 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/2307157", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
