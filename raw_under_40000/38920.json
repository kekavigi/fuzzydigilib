{"Nomor": 38920, "Judul": "Hexaazatrinaphthylene-Based Porous Organic Polymers as Organic Cathode Materials for Lithium-Ion Batteries", "Abstrak": "Incorporating small organic molecules with redox-active sites into a\nsuitable porous organic framework could enhance both ion diffusion rate and\nelectronic conductivity while reducing its solubility in electrolytes. Principles for the\nconstruction of a redox-active porous organic framework should not sacrifice the\ntheoretical capacity and should balance various important parameters such as\nspecific capacity, cycling stability, rate capability, as well as scalability. Herein, we\ndesigned two new porous organic frameworks as cathode materials for lithium-ion\nbatteries (LIBs) using hexaazatrinaphthalene (HATN) cores which show high\ntheoretical capacities. The polymer materials were synthesized in a facile and\nscalable manner with different structural features ranging from a rigid conjugated\nframework (HATNPF1) to a flexible nonconjugated framework (HATNPF2).\nHATNPF polymers demonstrated a high specific capacity (309 mA h g?1\n), and\nexcellent long-term cycling stability (92% capacity retention after 1200 cycles) and\nrate capability (65% capacity retention at 2 A g?1 as compared to capacity at 0.2 A\ng?1\n), which is an improvement over previously reported porous organic polymers and the HATN monomer. The structure?\nproperty relationships of these porous frameworks were also studied using computational modeling.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Jinquan Wang 1.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170647"}, "Penulis": "Jinquan Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Chung Shou Chen, Yugen Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "Organic cathode, Hexaazatriphenylene, Porous organic polymer, Rechargeable battery, Lithium ion, High performance, Long cycling", "Sumber": "ACS Sustainable Chem.
