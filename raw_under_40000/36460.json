Themembrane exhibited considerable proton conductivity andsuperb solvent resistance owing to its special phasemorphology, the presence of a broad hydrophilic ion transportchannel, and a crystalline hydrophobic matrix. The densesulfonated hydrophilic segment provides excellent protonconductivity; the Cr-SPAEK-20 membrane exhibits higher proton-conducting ability than Nafion 117 in the temperature rangeof 20?100\u00b0C; its proton conductivity reaches about 168 mS cm?1at 100\u00b0C. The crystalline PEK hydrophobic segmentensures superior solvent resistance and dimensional stability, guaranteeing the durability of the membrane in practicalapplications. The methanol permeability of Cr-SPAEK-20 is only one-eighth that of Nafion 117 when the test conditions are thesame. The direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC), which is assembled by Cr-SPAEK-20, exhibited satisfactory open circuit voltageand maximum power density during the testing process. The Cr-SPAEK membranes have shown potential for DMFCs aspolymer electrolyte materials", "Daftar File": {"2019_JRNL_PP_Di_Liu_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/162275"}, "Penulis": "Di Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yunji Xie,  Su Li,  Xiaocui Han, Haibo Zhang, Zheng Chen,inhui Pang,Zhenhua Jiang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "poly(aryl ether ketone), alcohol resistance, proton exchange membranes, crystalline PEK backbone,direct methanol fuel cell", "Sumber": "ACSAppl.EnergyMater.XXXX, XXX, XXX?XXX", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Mar 2019"}
