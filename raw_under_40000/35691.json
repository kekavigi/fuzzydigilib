{"Nomor": 35691, "Judul": "FERMIONIC LIEB-SCHULTZ-MATTIS THEOREMS AND WEAK SYMMETRY-PROTECTED PHASES", "Abstrak": "The Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem and its higher-dimensional generalizations by Oshikawa and\nHastings establish that a translation-invariant lattice model of spin- 12s can not have a nondegenerate ground state preserving both spin and translation symmetries. Recently, it was shown that LSM theorems can be interpreted in terms of bulk-boundary correspondence of certain weak symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. In this work, we discuss LSM-type theorems for two-dimensional fermionic systems, which have no bosonic analogs. They follow from a general classification of weak SPT phases of fermions in three dimensions.We further derive constraints on possible gapped symmetry-enriched topological phases in such systems. In particular, we show that lattice translations must permute anyons, thus leading to \u201csymmetry-enforced\u201d non-Abelian dislocations, or \u201cgenons.\u201d We also discuss surface states of other weak SPT phases of fermions.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MENG CHENG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW B 99, 075143 (2019); \u00a92019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Feb 2019"}
