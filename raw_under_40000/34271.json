{"Nomor": 34271, "Judul": "A Nano-Particle Based Approach To Improve Filtration Control Of Water Based Muds Under High Pressure High Temperature Conditions", "Abstrak": "There have been many attempts to improve the filtration control of water based muds under High Pressure High\nTemperature (HPHT) condition using a cost effective approach. Nano particles are perhaps the best option\nconsidering their successful applications reported in many studies. However, they are often expensive and pose\nunfavourably changes on the rheology of the muds. In this paper, an attempt was made to show the application\nof Nano Glass Flakes (NGFs) as a cheap but effective nano particle to control the filtration of water based muds\nunder HPHT conditions. Performing a series of rheology, filtration and conductivity tests on the mud samples\nwith unmodified NGFs revealed that this nano particle increases the mud rheology, yield point and gel strength\nof the mud with a slight impact on the filtration loss. However, by modifying the surface charges of NGFs with a\ncationic surfactant, filtration loss was significantly reduced without any severe impacts on the mud rheology.\nConsidering the conductivity of the mud which increases by adding the modified NGF, this nano particle might\nbe a good choice to improve the overall performance of water based muds under HPHT conditions.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ONG SIONG GUAN [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Raoof Gholami", "Arshad Raza", "Minou Rabiei", "Nikoo Fakhari", "Vamegh Rasouli", "Omid Nabinezhad"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Nano glass flakes, Filtration loss, Rheology, HPHT, Dispersion", "Sumber": "Petroleum - KeAi, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.10.006", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Feb 2019"}
