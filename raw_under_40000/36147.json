While so far mostly being applied in the analysis of many-body physics, we demonstrate that out-of-time-order correlation functions appear naturally in optical detection schemes with interferometric delay lines, and we apply our extended quantum regression theorem to calculate the nontrivial photon counting fluctuations in split and recombined signals from a quantum light source.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Philip Daniel Blocher [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Klaus M\u00f8lmer"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW A 99, 033816 (2019); \u00a92019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Mar 2019"}
