{"Nomor": 35114, "Judul": "Kinetics and modeling of artificial sweeteners degradation in wastewater by the UV/persulfate process", "Abstrak": "The frequent detection of artificial sweeteners (ASs) in wastewater and surface water gives rise to\nconcerns about their removal, Acesulfame (ACE) and sucralose (SUC) are two ASs that are difficult to\nremove. The ultraviolet/persulfate (UV/PS) advanced oxidation technology (AOT) is being considered as\nan effective process for the degradation of micropollutants in wastewater. However, the study of the\ndegradation of ASs in real wastewater by the UV/PS is minimal. This study investigated the kinetics and\nmodeling of ACE and SUC degradation in wastewater by the UV/PS process. Both ACE and SUC could be\ndegraded effectively using this process. The degradation of ACE was mainly attributed to UV photolysis\n(51%), HO? (26%) and SO4\n?- (16%), while that of SUC was mainly attributed to HO? (68%) and SO4\n?- (27%).\nThe second-order rate constants of ASs with SO4\n?- were significantly lower than that with HO?\n. Three\nmajor transformation products (TPs) of ACE and four major TPs of SUC were identified. Additionally, the\neffects and mechanisms of the water matrices, such as HCO3\n, Cl, NO3\n and natural organic matter\n(NOM), on ASs degradation were investigated through response surface methodology (RSM). NOM and\nCl significantly inhibited the degradation of ACE in the UV/PS system, whereas NOM and HCO3\n played a\nmain inhibition role on the degradation of SUC. A water matrices parameter model for predicting ASs\ndegradation in real wastewater was established by RSM for the first time, and the removal of ACE and\nSUC was well predicted by the model.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yingying Fu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Gang Wu.,Jinju Geng.,Juechun Li.,Shengnan Li.,Shengnan Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "UV/persulfate Artificial sweeteners Reactive species Predicting model based on water matrices Real wastewater", "Sumber": "Water Research 150 (2019) 12-20", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Feb 2019"}
