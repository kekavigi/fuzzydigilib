{"Nomor": 37571, "Judul": "FIRST-PASSAGE FAILURE OF PREISACH HYSTERETIC SYSTEMS", "Abstrak": "The first-passage failure of a single-degree-of-freedom hysteretic system with non-\nlocal memory is investigated. The hysteretic behavior is described through a Preisach model with\nexcitation selected as Gaussian white noise. First, the equivalent nonlinear non-hysteretic sys-\ntem with amplitude-dependent damping and stiffness coefficients is derived through generalized\nharmonic balance technique. Then, equivalent damping and stiffness coefficients are expressed as\nfunctions of systemenergy by using the relation of amplitude to systemenergy.The stochastic aver-\naging of energy envelope is adopted to accept the averaged It\u02c6o stochastic differential equation with\nrespect to system energy. The establishing and solving of the associated backward Kolmogorov\nequation yields the reliability function and probability density of first-passage time. The effects of\nsystem parameters on first-passage failure are investigated concisely and validated throughMonte\nCarlo simulation.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ming Xu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["X iao ling J,  in Yo ng Wang,  Z hilo ng Huan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "first-passage failure, Preisach hysteretic systems, stochastic averaging of energy envelope, generalized harmonic balance technique", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Apr 2019"}
