This  article  argues  that,  since Frank\u2019s  book  appeared,  the  \u2018\u2018convergence  of  commerce  and  content\u2019\u2019\nas  the advertising  industry calls  it has  meant  that  the  production  of  content  is  even more  entwined  with  advertising  than  ever  before.  The  first  part  of  this  article describes this shift with particular attention paid to the production of advertising music, which increasingly employs well-known rock, hip-hop, and other popular musicians. The analytical portion of this article draws on the studies of Richard A.
