{"Nomor": 32481, "Judul": "Spatial and Temporal Distribution Law and Influencing Factors of the Mining-Induced Deformation and Failure of Gas Boreholes", "Abstrak": "Because gas boreholes are easy to damage by integrated coal mining and gas exploration, based on the practice of relieving\npressure in deep thin coal seams in the Huainan mining area, a multidimensional coupling numerical simulation method was used\nto reveal the space-time evolution characteristics and influence factors of fracture deformation of gob-side gas boreholes. Results\nindicate that the danger zone for borehole fractures is primarily between 5 and 12m above the roof of the roadway. +e final-hole\nposition has little effect on the stability of boreholes, and migrating the open-hole position to the entity coal side and roadway roof\nside can improve the stability of the borehole. +e initial failure of the borehole occurs at a distance of 10m behind the coal face.\n+e failure of the borehole is largely stable at a distance of 100 to 120m behind the coal face. With the increase in mining height,\nwhich leads to an increase in the movement of strata and an increase in pressure relief range, the shear stability of the borehole is\nreduced, and the extrusion stability of the borehole is improved. A hard roof condition promotes borehole shear stability, while\na weak roof condition promotes borehole extrusion stability. +is change can decrease the maintenance difficulty associated with\n\u201cminor supports\u201d in boreholes to a certain extent by reinforcing the support strength of \u201cprimary supports\u201d in roadway retaining\nwalls. +e simulation results are consistent with observed results for the 11 test boreholes, and the accuracy of the numerical\nsimulation is verified.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "FEI XUE [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiaowei Feng"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Coal Mining", "Sumber": "Advances in Materials Science and Engineering Volume 2018, Article ID 9580526, 15 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/9580526", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
