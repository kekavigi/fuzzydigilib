{"Nomor": 34098, "Judul": "The effect of various lengths of pores and throats on the formation resistivity factor", "Abstrak": "Pore geometry, quantified by the length and size of the pore space, affects the electrical resistivity of the porous\nmedia. However, the length described by the geometrical tortuosity and pore topology effect on the resistivity of\nthe model does not thoroughly consider the existing pore geometrical models, which only investigate the pore\nsize, throat length and throat size of the models. A modified capillary model including a pore body and several\nthroats derived the formation factor from the coordination number, the cross-sectional area ratio and geometrical\ntortuosity of the pores and throats in the model. The derived relationship between the formation factor and\nporosity of the capillary model compared with the formation factor versus porosity for the various rock types\nwas shown in a plot. The geometrical tortuosity of each rock type almost followed the electrical tortuosity of\nthe related rock type, and the electrical tortuosity was larger than the geometrical tortuosity caused by the variation\nin the size of the pore and throat. For low porosity, the resistivity of the real porous media was lower than\nthe resistivity of the Archie equation due to the low values of the pore-to-throat cross-sectional area ratio and\ngeometrical tortuosity. The sandstones and interparticle carbonates presented a porosity exponent close to 2.0\nand an electrical tortuosity from 1.5 to 4.0 on the plot of the porosity exponent versus electrical tortuosity. The\nfractured carbonate showed a porosity exponent from 1.0 to 1.6 and an electrical tortuosity ranging from 1.0\nto 3.0,while the vuggy carbonateswerewidely distributed,with a porosity exponent larger than 2.0 and an electrical\ntortuosity ranging from 2 to 8. This new model correlates the formation factor and porosity to the combination\nof the coordination number with the geometrical tortuosity and the throat and pore cross-sectional\narea ratios, thus enhancing the understanding of the pore geometry and topology effect on the electrical resistivity\nof a porous media with various pore types.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Haitao Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jinyan Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Archie equation Modified capillary model Tortuosity Pore-to-throat cross-sectional area ratio Porosity exponent Formation factor", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 162 (2019) 35\u201346, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2019.01.005", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Feb 2019"}
