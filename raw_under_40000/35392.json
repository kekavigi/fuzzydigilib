{"Nomor": 35392, "Judul": "Developing Grey-Box Model To Diagnose Asphaltene Stability In Crude Oils: Application Of Refractive Index", "Abstrak": "Asphaltene precipitation can cause serious problems in petroleum industry while diagnosing the\nasphaltene stability conditions in crude oil system is still a challenge and has been subject of many\ninvestigations. To monitor and diagnose asphaltene stability, high performance intelligent approaches based bio-inspired science like artificial neural network which have been optimized by\nvarious optimization techniques have been carried out. The main purpose of the implemented\noptimization algorithms is to decide high accurate interconnected weights of proposed neural\nnetwork model. The proposed intelligent approaches are examined by using extensive experimental data reported in open literature. Moreover, to highlight robustness and precision of the\naddressed approaches, two different regression models have been developed and results obtained\nfrom the aforementioned intelligent models and regression approaches are compared with the\ncorresponding refractive index data measured in laboratory. Based on the results, hybrid of genetic\nalgorithm and particle swarm optimization have high performance and average relative absolute\ndeviation between the model outputs and the relevant experimental data was found to be less than\n0.2%. Routs from this work indicate that implication of HGAPSO-ANN in monitoring refractive index\ncan lead to more reliable estimation of addressed issue which can lead to design of more reliable\nphase behavior simulation and further plans of oil production", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mahdi Zeinali Hasanvand  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mohammad Ali Ahmadi", "Reza Mosayebi Behbahani", "Farzaneh Feyzi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Asphaltene, Refractive index, Stability, Evolutionary algorithm, Neural network", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 4, Pages 369-380 (December 2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Feb 2019"}
