{"Nomor": 38322, "Judul": "Mapping the journey: visualising collaborative experiences for sustainable design education", "Abstrak": "The paradigm of design is changing. Designers now need to be equipped with the\nskills and knowledge that will enable them to participate in the global move towards a sus-\ntainable future. The challenges arise as Design for Sustainability deals with very complex and\noften contradictory issues. Collaborative learning experiences recognise that these complex\nissuescanbeaddressedwiththepoolingofdiverseknowledge,perspectives,cultures,skillsand\ntools. Unless, however the process of collaboration is explored in detail, the opportunity for\nreflection, learning and improvement is lost. This paper proposes that by introducing and\nanalysing collaboration within third level design education, the capacity for responsible design\npractice can be developed, leading to a transformative shift in how designers are taught as\nstudents and subsequently practice as professionals. Over two multidisciplinary projects\ndevised and undertaken by design students from the University of Limerick (Ireland), Hoge-\nschoolUtrecht(Netherlands)andVirginiaCommonwealthUniversity(USA),thecollaborative\npathismapped and criticaljunctionsidentified. From thisprocess ofmappingandvisualisation,\ncollective narratives of the overall project experience are constructed (through the eyes of the\nparticipantsand planners).Thisleads toa greaterunderstandingand appreciation of the benefits\nand limitations of the collaborative experience.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Muireann McMahon [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Tracy Bhamra"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Product Design, Design education, Collaboration, Design process", "Sumber": "International  Journal Technology, Des Educ (2017) 27:595\u2013609", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Mei 2019"}
