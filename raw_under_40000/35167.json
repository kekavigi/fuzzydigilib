{"Nomor": 35167, "Judul": "KURTOSIS OF ELLIPTIC FLOW FLUCTUATIONS", "Abstrak": "Elliptic flow (v2) in ultrarelativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions fluctuates event to event, both in magnitude\nand in orientation with respect to the reaction plane. Even though the reaction plane is not known event to event in experiment, we show that the statistical properties of v2 fluctuations in the reaction plane can be precisely extracted from experimental data. Previous studies have shown how to measure the mean, variance and skewness using the first three cumulants v2{2}, v2{4}, and v2{6}. We complement these studies by providing a formula for the kurtosis, which requires an accurate determination of the next cumulant v2{8}. Using existing data, we show that the kurtosis is positive for most centralities, in contrast with the kurtosis of triangular flow fluctuations, which is negative. We argue that these features are robust predictions of fluid-dynamical models.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "RAJEEV S.
