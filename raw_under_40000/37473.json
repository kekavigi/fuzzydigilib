{"Nomor": 37473, "Judul": "Protein?Inorganic Hybrid Nanoflower-Rooted Agarose HydrogelPlatform for Point-of-Care Detection of Acetylcholine", "Abstrak": "Rapid and precise profiling of acetylcholine (ACh) has become importantfor diagnosing diseases and safeguarding health care because of its pivotal role in thecentral nervous system. Herein, we developed a new colorimetric sensor based on protein?inorganic hybrid nanoflowers as artificial peroxidase, comprising a test kit and asmartphone reader, which sensitively quantifies ACh in human serum. In this sensor, AChindirectly triggered the substrate reaction with the help of a multienzyme system includingacetylcholinesterase, choline oxidase, and mimic peroxidase (nanoflowers), accompanyingthe enhancement of absorbance intensity at 652 nm. Therefore, the multienzyme platformcan be used to detect ACh via monitoring the change of the absorbance in a range from0.0005 to 6.0 mmol L?1. It is worth mentioning that the platform was used to prepare aportable agarose gel-based kit for rapid qualitative monitoring of ACh. Coupling withImageJ program, the image information of test kits can be transduced into the hueparameter, which provides a directly quantitative tool to identify ACh. Based on theadvantages of simple operation, good selectivity, and low cost, the availability of a portablekit for point-of-care testing will achieve the needs of frequent screening and diagnostic tracking", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Deshuai_Kong_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164537"}, "Penulis": "Deshuai Kong [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Rui Jin,Xu Zhao,Hongxia Li,Xu Yan,Fangmeng Liu,Peng Sun,Yuan Gao,Xishuang Liang,Yuehe Lin,Geyu Lu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "protein?inorganic hybrid nanoflowers, portable kits, point-of-care, nanozyme, acetylcholine", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
