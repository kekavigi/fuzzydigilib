Among the philosophers who wrote and tried to understand the concept of space as well as the concept of image, referring to and being influenced by the models and elements  in  the  Renaissance  period  are Paul  Deussen,  Immanuel  Kant,  and  Ernst Cassirer. Also  we  approach  elements  from  the  art  of  perspective pertaining  to  the philosophy of perception and to semiotics.\nThroughout the process we demonstrate the value and importance of perspective to conceptual thinking, of the use of some renaissance elements in  philosophical and semiotic  studies and  their  role in  visual \ncommunication.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "IOANA DIANA VOLOAC?
