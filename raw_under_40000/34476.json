{"Nomor": 34476, "Judul": "PERFECT DISCRIMINATION OF NONORTHOGONAL QUANTUM STATES WITH POSTERIOR CLASSICAL PARTIAL INFORMATION", "Abstrak": "The indistinguishability of nonorthogonal pure states lies at the heart of quantum information processing.\nAlthough the indistinguishability reflects the impossibility of measuring complementary physical quantities by a single measurement, we demonstrate that the distinguishability can be perfectly retrieved simply with the help of posterior classical partial information.We demonstrate this by showing an ensemble of nonorthogonal pure states such that a state randomly sampled from the ensemble can be perfectly identified by a single measurement with the help of postprocessing of the measurement outcomes and additional partial information about the sampled state, i.e., the label of the subensemble from which the state is sampled. When an ensemble consists of two subensembles, we show that the perfect distinguishability of the ensemble with the help of postprocessing can be restated as a matrix- decomposition problem. Furthermore, we give the analytical solution for the problem\nwhen both subensembles consist of two states.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SEISEKI AKIBUE [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["GO KATO,", "AND NAOKI MARUMO"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW A 99, 020102(R) (2019); \u00a92019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Feb 2019"}
