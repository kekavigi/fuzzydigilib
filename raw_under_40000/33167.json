{"Nomor": 33167, "Judul": "Focus On Adsorptive Equilibrium, Kinetics And Thermodynamic Components Of Petroleum Produced Water Biocoagulation Using Novel Tympanotonos Fuscatus Extract", "Abstrak": "Adsorptive component of produced water (PW) coagulation using Tympanotonos Fuscatus coagulant\n(TFC) was studied. Influence of the following parameters: pH, coagulant dose, settling time, and temperature were investigated. The functional group, crystalline nature, morphological observation and\nthermal characteristics of the sample were evaluated. Equilibrium data were analyzed using Langmuir,\nFreundlich, Temkin, Frumkin, and Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) adsorption isotherms. The kinetics data\nwere fitted to reversible first order, pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, elovich, intra-particle\ndiffusion and Boyd kinetic models. Adsorption Gibbs energy, enthalpy and entropy were evaluated.\nEquilibrium data best fitted the Langmuir isotherm (R2 > 0.99; X2 < 1.6; SSE < 1.6). Reversible first order\nmodel correlated best to the kinetics data. The values of process average Gibb's free energy, enthalpy and\nentropy were 30.35, 27.88 and 0.1891 kJ/mol, respectively. The process was spontaneous, feasible and\nendothermic in nature. The maximum efficiency of 83.1% was favored at pH 2.0. This study indicated\nsignificant adsorptive component, while using Tympanotonos Fuscatus extract as readily available,\nrenewable, ecofriendly bio e coagulant for efficient treatments of PW", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MATTHEW MENKITI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ifechukwu Ezemagu, Sreeram Singaraju"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Petroleum produced water, Coagulation, Adsorption, T.Fuscatus shell", "Sumber": "Petroleum 4 (2018) 56-64 - KeAi, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2017.09.005", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "16 Jan 2019"}
