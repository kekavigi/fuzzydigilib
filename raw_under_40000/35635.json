{"Nomor": 35635, "Judul": "Art ? Artefact ? Commodity: Installation design and the exhibition of Oceanic things at two New York museums in the 1940s", "Abstrak": "This article documents some of the experimentation in museum installation designs for the\nexhibition of non-Western objects during the 1930s and 1940s. This is a period in which\nethnographic artefacts were being displayed as artworks in natural history museums and in\nwhich the exhibition of such objects in art museums drew on techniques characteristic of not\nonly natural history museums, but also commercial urban window displays (which were\nthemselves enjoying a period of dazzling exuberance). The article focuses on one collection of\nPacific Islands objects now housed at the Buffalo Museum of Science and on the installation\ndesigns of Rene ?d\u2019Harnoncourt and Trevor Thomas. It responds to the provocation of Alfred\nGell\u2019s influential writings on art and agency, specifically, his conception of art as entrapment\nand enchantment\u2014his claim that artworks captivate, and thus exert a kind of (secondary)\nagency on people (patients).", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Robert J.Foster [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Installation Art, museum ekhibits, commercial product", "Sumber": "The  Australian  Journal  of  Anthropology (2012) 23, 129\u2013157", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Feb 2019"}
