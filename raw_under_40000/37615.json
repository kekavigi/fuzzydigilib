{"Nomor": 37615, "Judul": "Probability of co-channel interference for selection diversity reception in the Nakagami m-fading channel", "Abstrak": "A recent second generation highcapacity\nmobile radio telephone system in Japan\nemploys selection diversity with two branches on\nthe mobile receiver to counteract co-channel interference\nfrom distant base stations operating with\nidentical frequencies. From an actual point of view\nit seems more reasonable to assume that the fluctuations\nof signal carrier envelopes on the mobile\nreceiver are approximated by the m-distribution\nproposed by Nakagami when we try to investigate\nfading statistics for land mobile radio not only in\nurban areas but in suburban or open areas. The\nm-distribution is a generalisation of the Rayleigh\ndistribution and it can take account of the influence\nof a superimposed specular component other\nthan scattered and reflected waves. The probability\ndensity function of the wanted signal envelope\nand its characteristic function for selection diversity\nin the m-fading channel are derived in conveniently\nclosed form, and the probability of\nco-channel interference that the wanted signalcarrier\nto interference power ratio (CIR) is less\nthan a specified protection ratio is calculated. The\nresults obtained will serve to decide the modulation\nsystem employed and to estimate the frequency\nre-use distance, the number of channel\ngroups, and the efficiency of spectrum use in cellular\nmobile radio.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Prof. S.
