{"Nomor": 35797, "Judul": "Increasing municipal wastewater BNR by using the preferred carbon source derived from kitchen wastewater to enhance phosphorus uptake and short-cut nitrification-denitrification", "Abstrak": "A new method for increasing municipal wastewater biological nutrient removal (BNR) by using kitchen wastewater-derived carbon source to simultaneously enhance phosphorus uptake and short-cut nitrification\u2013denitrification was reported. Firstly, laboratory tests were conducted to maximize the volatile fatty acids (VFA)\nproduction with the greatest propionic/acetic acid ratio (i.e., the preferred carbon source) from kitchen wastewater. Compared with the un-controlled pH fermentation, alkaline fermentation increased the yield of VFA\nand the ratio of propionic/acetic acid by 63.6% and 140.5%, respectively. Then, the alkaline fermentation liquid\nwas used as the additional carbon source of municipal wastewater BNR in lab-scale reactors, and the results\nshowed that it achieved much greater nitrogen and phosphorus removal than the un-fermented kitchen wastewater. Finally, the full-scale works with alkaline fermentation of kitchen wastewater and the application of the\nfermentation liquid to improve municipal wastewater BNR were operated. The long-term experiments indicated\nthat the alkaline fermentation liquid had a VFA content of 66.3% (COD based), VFA yield of 0.63, and ratio of\npropionic/acetic acid of 0.86/1, and the supplement of alkaline fermentation liquid to municipal wastewater\ncaused higher total nitrogen and total phosphorus removal than acetic acid (78.2% versus 69.6%, and 95.2% against 88.4%). Further mechanism investigation indicated that the presence of propionic and humic acids\nsignificantly increased phosphorus uptake, denitrifying phosphorus removal, and short-cut nitrification and\ndenitrification in the BNR experiments, which was the main reason for alkaline fermentation liquid showing\ngreater total nitrogen and phosphorus removal abilities than traditional carbon source.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xiong Zheng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Weinan Zhou.,Rui Wan.,Jingyang Luo.,Yinglong Su.,Haining Huang.,Yinguang Chen"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Kitchen wastewater Preferred carbon source Alkaline fermentation Municipal wastewater", "Sumber": "Chemical Engineering Journal 344 (2018) 556\u2013564", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Mar 2019"}
