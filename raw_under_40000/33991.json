{"Nomor": 33991, "Judul": "Environmental Benefits of Novel Nonhuman Food Inputs to Salmon Feeds", "Abstrak": ": Global population growth and changing diets\nincrease the importance, and challenges, of reducing the\nenvironmental impacts of food production. Farmed seafood is\na relatively efficient way to produce protein and has already\novertaken wild fisheries. The use of protein-rich food crops,\nsuch as soy, instead of fishmeal in aquaculture feed diverts\nthese important protein sources away from direct human\nconsumption and creates new environmental challenges.\nSingle cell proteins (SCPs), including bacteria and yeast,\nhave recently emerged as replacements for plant-based\nproteins in salmon feeds. Attributional life cycle assessment\nis used to compare salmon feeds based on protein from soy,\nmethanotrophic bacteria, and yeast ingredients. All ingredients\nare modeled at the industrial production scale and compared\nbased on seven resource use and emissions indicators. Yeast protein concentrate showed drastically lower impacts in all\ncategories compared to soy protein concentrate. Bacteria meal also had lower impacts than soy protein concentrate for five of\nthe seven indicators. When these target meals were incorporated into complete feeds the relative trends remain fairly constant,\nbut benefits of the novel ingredients are dampened by high impacts from the nontarget ingredients. Particularly, primary\nproduction requirements (PPR) are about equal and constant across all feeds for both analyses since PPR was driven by\nfishmeal and oil. The bacteria-based feed has the highest climate change impacts due to the use of methane to feed the bacteria\nwho then release carbon dioxide. Overall, the results of this study suggest that incorporating SCP ingredients into salmon feeds\ncan help reduce the environmental impacts of salmon production. Continued improvements  in SCP production would further increase the sustainability of salmon farming.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jessica L.
