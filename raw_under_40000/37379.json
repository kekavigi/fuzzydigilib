{"Nomor": 37379, "Judul": "Monumental architecture in West Polynesia: origins, chiefs and archaeological approaches", "Abstrak": "In West Polynesia, monumental structures with a volume s 2500\nm^ include mounds of earth or stone that in U-aditional history were\nused to house or bury chiefs, as well as being the focus of\nceremonial and religious activity. We review archaeological theory\nabout the initiation of monumental architecture and examines how\nchiefly and high-status activity might be identifled. Large\nstructures with monumental dimensions often have a complicated\nconstruction history that spanned several centuries indicating\nchange to the social structure, particularly the power of elites. As a\nresult archaeologists need to develop ideas that relate episodes of\narchitectonic change to alterations in the prehistoric socio-political\nsystem.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "GEOFFREY CLARK [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["GEOFFREY CLARK"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Monumental architecture ; West Polynesia ;  and archaeological approaches", "Sumber": "Archaeol.
