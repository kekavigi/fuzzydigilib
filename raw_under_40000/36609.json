{"Nomor": 36609, "Judul": "Progress, problems and prospects for standardization of greenhouse-related technologies", "Abstrak": "In recent years, the scale of greenhouse grows rapidly and steadily in China, which promotes the development of\ngreenhouse technology and the demand for standardized technology. However, the standardization process of greenhouse\nindustry in China has been facing with the problem of unbalanced development with the practical standard system for many\nyears. To solve these problems, the most characteristic greenhouse designs used in China contributing to this work are\npresented in detail. And the development of standard system and the standardization efforts of them are summarized and\nanalyzed in relationship to the data presented in this paper. In this way the origin of greenhouse standard system in China and\ncontext of the system development and standardization of greenhouse structure are clarified. It was also found that the\ndevelopment and iterative update of greenhouse standard system are under the influences of enterprises which as the\nparticipation of standard constitutors were proved to play an important role in promoting the standardization development of\ngreenhouse. The outcome of this work may be utilized to perfect the greenhouse standardization system and improve the\ngreenhouse standardization efficiency that dominate the facility agriculture in China.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yanzhao Ren [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Minjuan Wang, Iftikhar Ahmed Saeeda, Xuerui Chen1, Wanlin Gao"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Architecture", "Kata Kunci": "greenhouse, standardization, standard system, informationization, greenhouse technology", "Sumber": "Int J Agric & Biol Eng Open Access at https://www.ijabe.org Vol. 11 No.1", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Mar 2019"}
