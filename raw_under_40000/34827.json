{"Nomor": 34827, "Judul": "Review And Prospect On The Botryoidal Structures From The Sinian Dengying Formation, Sichuan Basin, China", "Abstrak": "Fabric of carbonate rock is the important foundation and one of main research contents for study on\ncarbonate sedimentology, and has always been the attention of the academic circles. Botryoidal\nstructures from the Sinian Dengying Formation in the Sichuan Basin is a kind of special carbonate\nfabric, the fabric is named after the shape of a grape. In this paper, from four aspects of the research\nstatus, the definition of the botryoidal structures and the related terms, the construction characteristics of the botryoidal structures, the component of the botryoidal structures, geochemical\ncharacteristics and the genesis of the botryoidal structures are reviewed. It points out the current\nresearch issues of botryoidal structures from the Sinian Dengying Formation in the Sichuan Basin,\nand put forward that future research should focus on the accurate analysis of its internal construction, precipitation mechanism of the major components, and the construction mechanism of\nbotryoidal structures.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Chengbo Lian  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Guanxiong Ren", "Fang Qu", "Xiucheng Tan", "Ling Li", "Wei Zeng", "Guang Hu", "Hong Liu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Botryoidal structures, Construction, Lamina, Genesis", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 3, Issue 2, Pages 190-196 (Juni 2017)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Feb 2019"}
