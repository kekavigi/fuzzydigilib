{"Nomor": 38489, "Judul": "Draining the swampland", "Abstrak": "We discuss some implications of the recently suggested swampland conjecture j?Vj V ? c ? 1, together\nwith a previous one ?? ? 1.We list some implications for particle phenomenology and the early Universe.\nThe most intriguing implication of the conjecture could be a significant shift in allowed inflationary models, if not ruling out slow-roll (single field) inflation altogether. The tension of inflation and the conjecture does not only regard the amplitude of the tensor spectrum, but also its tilt, as c ? 1 implies both a yet unobserved tensor to scalar ratio, and an enhancement of the observed scalar power spectrum on large\nscales in discord with current data that favors a suppression on these scales. Scalar fields are abundant in theories of quantum gravity. Considering a second scalar field, its dynamics are dictated by the relation\nbetween its mass, m, and the Hubble parameter, H, at different epochs in the history of the Universe. This\nscalar field, a drainon, fulfills the conjecture draining up the swampland. For inflation, this drainon requires a modest hierarchy compared to the inflaton. For the rest of the thermal history of the Universe, the drainon can be a coherently oscillating scalar field strengthening the case of dark matter candidates of that sort.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ido Ben-Dayan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW D 99, 101301(R) (2019); Published by the American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Mei 2019"}
