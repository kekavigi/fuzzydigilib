{"Nomor": 32649, "Judul": "Orthogonal Experimental Studies on Preparation of Mine-Filling Materials from Carbide Slag, Granulated Blast-Furnace Slag, Fly Ash, and Flue-Gas Desulphurisation Gypsum", "Abstrak": "Environmentally friendly and cheap composite green cementitious materials have been prepared from carbide slag, fly ash, fluegas desulphurisation (FGD) gypsum, and granulated blast-furnace slag (GBFS) without using cement clinker. Orthogonal testing\nwas used to investigate the effects of the raw materials on the amount of water required for reaching standard consistency and\nconsistency, setting time, slump value, and strength of the produced materials after curing for 7 d and 28 d. Scanning electron\nmicroscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques were used for the analysis of the sample microstructure and hydration\nproducts as well as for the exploration of possible hydration mechanisms. We found that, among the utilised raw materials, the\naddition of FGD gypsum had the most significant effect on the setting time and amount of water required for reaching standard\nconsistency and consistency, while the addition of GBFS deeply affected the slump value. +e optimal activation results were\nobtained when the mass ratio of carbide slag : fly ash : GBFS : FGD gypsum was equal to 12.1 : 60.6 :18.2 : 9.1.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mingyue Wu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiangming Hu", "Qian Zhang", "Weimin Cheng", "and Zunxiang Hu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Iron and Steel Mills and Ferroalloy Manufacturing", "Sumber": "Advances in Materials Science and Engineering Volume 2018, Article ID 4173520, 12 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/4173520", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Des 2018"}
