{"Nomor": 37598, "Judul": "Particle robotics based on statistical mechanics of loosely coupled components", "Abstrak": "Biological organisms achieve robust high-level behaviours by\ncombining and coordinating stochastic low-level components1\u20133. By\ncontrast, most current robotic systems comprise either monolithic\nmechanisms4,5 or modular units with coordinated motions6,7. Such\nrobots require explicit control of individual components to perform\nspecific functions, and the failure of one component typically\nrenders the entire robot inoperable. Here we demonstrate a robotic\nsystem whose overall behaviour can be successfully controlled by\nexploiting statistical mechanics phenomena. We achieve this by\nincorporating many loosely coupled \u2018particles\u2019, which are incapable\nof independent locomotion and do not possess individual identity\nor addressable position. In the proposed system, each particle is\npermitted to perform only uniform volumetric oscillations that are\nphase-modulated by a global signal. Despite the stochastic motion of\nthe robot and lack of direct control of its individual components, we\ndemonstrate physical robots composed of up to two dozen particles\nand simulated robots with up to 100,000 particles capable of robust\nlocomotion, object transport and phototaxis (movement towards a\nlight stimulus). Locomotion is maintained even when 20 per cent\nof the particles malfunction. These findings indicate that stochastic\nsystems may offer an alternative approach to more complex and\nexacting robots via large-scale robust amorphous robotic systems\nthat exhibit deterministic behaviour.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Shuguang Li [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Richa Batra, David Brown"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "Nature", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Apr 2019"}
