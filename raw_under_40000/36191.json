{"Nomor": 36191, "Judul": "A Prediction Method Of Natural Gas Hydrate Formation In Deepwater Gas Well And Its Application", "Abstrak": "To prevent the deposition of natural gas hydrate in deepwater gas well, the hydrate formation area\nin wellbore must be predicted. Herein, by comparing four prediction methods of temperature in\npipe with field data and comparing five prediction methods of hydrate formation with experiment\ndata, a method based on OLGA & PVTsim for predicting the hydrate formation area in wellbore was\nproposed. Meanwhile, The hydrate formation under the conditions of steady production, throttling\nand shut-in was predicted by using this method based on a well data in the South China Sea. The\nresults indicate that the hydrate formation area decreases with the increase of gas production,\ninhibitor concentrations and the thickness of insulation materials and increases with the increase of\nthermal conductivity of insulation materials and shutdown time. Throttling effect causes a plunge\nin temperature and pressure in wellbore, thus leading to an increase of hydrate formation area.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yanli Guo [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Baojiang Sun", "Keke Zhao", "Hongkun Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Deepwater gas well, Hydrate prediction, Steady production, Downhole throttling, Well shut-in", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 3, Pages 29-300 (September  2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Mar 2019"}
