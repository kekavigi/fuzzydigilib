{"Nomor": 33582, "Judul": "THEORETICAL STUDY OF THE ?++-?? CONFIGURATION IN THE DEUTERON USING AN ANTIPROTON BEAM", "Abstrak": "We study the manifestation of the \n++-\n? component of the deuteron wave function in the exclusive reaction\np\u00afd ? ?\n?\n?\n?\n\n++. Due to the large binding energy the internal motion in the - system is relativistic. We\ntake this into account within the light-cone (LC) wave function formalism and, indeed, found large differences\nbetween calculations based on the LC and nonrelativistic (NR) wave functions. We demonstrate that the\nconsistent LC treatment of the - system plays the key role in the separation of the signal and background.\nWithin the LC approach, the characteristic shape of the momentum distribution of the - bound system\npredicted by the meson-exchange model is well visible on the background of usual annihilations at beam\nmomenta between 10 and 15 GeV/c.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "A.
