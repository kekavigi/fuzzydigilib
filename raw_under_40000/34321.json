{"Nomor": 34321, "Judul": "Without Criteria: Art and Learning and the Adventure of Pedagogy", "Abstrak": "A key aim of this article is to present a discursus on learning and teaching in the context of art educa-\ntion that softens transcendent historical and ideological framings of art education and its purpose. In\ncontrast it places emphasis upon the immanence and necessary transcendence of local events of learning that occur in whatever framing and which have the potential to extend our comprehension of\nwhat art and learning can become. It recommends a\u2018pedagogical reversal\u2019 where by external transcen-\ndent lenses and their respective knowledge and criteria for practice are relaxed and proposes a peda-\ngogy\u2018 without criteria\u2019. A key pedagogical issue revolves around\u2018 how something matters\u2019 for a learner\nin his or her experience of a learning encounter and trying to comprehend this\u2018mattering\u2019 constitutes\na pedagogical adventure for a teacher. The notion of mattering in the context of art practice and\nlearning cannot be divorced from the force of art which is the motive force that precipitates a poten-\ntial for learning and can expand our understanding of what art and learning can become. The article\nis therefore premised on the idea that it is not a case of coming to understand art through established\nknowledge and practice but the force of art challenging us to think. The force of art, or art\u2019s event,\ncan be conceived therefore as a process with a potential for the individuation of new worlds or to see\nthat other worlds might be possible.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Dennis Atkinson [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "pedagogy, immanence, learning, poiesis, relevance", "Sumber": "THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION, 2017", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Feb 2019"}
