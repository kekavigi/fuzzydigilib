{"Nomor": 38276, "Judul": "Design considerations for environmental sustainability in high density development: a case study of Hong Kong", "Abstrak": "This study has indicated that there is close relationship between development density and environmental quality; therefore, it is necessary to decide the form of development carefully beforehand. The form of development is shaped either by new development or urban renewal which is a major tactic nowadays adopted by the Hong Kong Government to improve the living condition of the citizens and the quality of the built environment. This study is limited to urban renewal and aims to find out the major urban design considerations for sustaining the environment. Through a questionnaire survey carried out in Hong Kong, the opinions of architects, planners, property development managers, and local citizens were sought and evaluated, and critical design factors for enhancing environmental sustainability of urban renewal projects are highlighted. The results derived from factor analysis indicated that certain design considerations should be incorporated for sustaining the urban environment. \u2018\u2018Land Use Planning\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018Quality of Life\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018Conservation & Preservation\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018Integrated Design\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018Provision of Welfare Facilities\u2019\u2019, and \u2018\u2018Conservation of Existing Properties\u2019\u2019 were believed to be the significant underlying factors for achieving environmental sustainability of local urban renewal projects.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Edwin H.
