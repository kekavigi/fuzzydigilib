{"Nomor": 37424, "Judul": "Effect of the Hydroxyl Group on Yields and Composition of Organic Aerosol Formed from OH Radical-Initiated Reactions of Alcohols in the Presence of NOx", "Abstrak": "The effect of a hydroxyl group and its position on the yields of\nsecondary organic aerosol (SOA) formed from OH radical-initiated reactions\nof the 1- to 5-decanol isomers, 1- and 2-undecanol isomers, and n-decane in\nthe presence of NOx was investigated in a series of environmental chamber\nexperiments. SOA composition was also measured using liquid chromatography,\nmass spectrometry, and infrared spectroscopy, and gas-phase aldehydes\nwere measured using gas chromatography and proton transfer reaction?mass\nspectrometry. It was observed that all decanol isomers formed SOA of a\nsimilar composition, which consisted of products similar to those known to\nbe formed from the reaction of n-decane but with an added hydroxyl or keto\ngroup. SOA yields measured for the decanol isomers were all higher than the\nyield from n-decane because of the general lowering of product vapor\npressures by the added hydroxyl group, but they decreased monotonically as\nthe hydroxyl group moved from the end of the molecule to the middle....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lucas B.
