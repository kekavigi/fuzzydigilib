{"Nomor": 35952, "Judul": "SPECTRAL DIMENSION REDUCTION OF COMPLEX DYNAMICAL NETWORKS", "Abstrak": "Dynamical networks are powerful tools for modeling a broad range of complex systems, including\nfinancial markets, brains, and ecosystems. They encode how the basic elements (nodes) of these systems interact altogether (via links) and evolve (nodes\u2019 dynamics). Despite substantial progress, little is known about why some subtle changes in the network structure, at the so-called critical points, can provoke drastic shifts in its dynamics. We tackle this challenging problem by introducing a method that reduces any network to a simplified low-dimensional version. It can then be used to describe the collective dynamics of the original system. This dimension reduction method relies on spectral graph theory and, more specifically, on the dominant eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the network adjacency matrix. Contrary to previous approaches, our method is able to predict the multiple activation of modular networks as well as the critical points of random networks with arbitrary degree distributions. Our results are of both fundamental and practical interest, as they offer a novel framework to relate the structure of networks to their dynamics and to study the resilience of complex systems.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "EDWARD LAURENCE [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["NICOLAS DOYON,", "LOUIS J.
