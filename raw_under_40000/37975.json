{"Nomor": 37975, "Judul": "Numerical Approach For Enhanced Oil Recovery With Surfactant Flooding", "Abstrak": "The remained oil in the reservoir after conventional water-flooding processes, forms a dispersed\nphase in the form of oil drops which is trapped by capillary forces and is almost about 70% of the\noriginal oil in the place (OOIP). To reduce oil residual saturation in laboratory experiments and field\nprojects, surfactant flooding is effective via decreasing the interfacial tension mobility ratio between oil and water phases. Estimation of the role of design variables, like chemical concentrations,\npartition coefficient and injection rate in different performance quantities, considering a heterogeneous and multiphase oil reservoir is a critical stage for optimal design. Increasing demand for oil\nproduction from water-flooded reservoirs has caused an increasing interest in surfactant-polymer\n(SP) and alkali-surfactant-polymer (ASP). Modeling minimizes the risk of high cost of chemicals by\nimproving our insight of process. In the present paper, a surfactant compositional flood model for a\nthree-component (water, petroleum and surfactant), two phase (aqueous and oleic) system is\nstudied. A homogeneous, two-dimensional, isothermal reservoir with no free gas or alkali is\nassumed. The governing equations are in three categories: the continuity equations for the transport of each component, Darcy's equation for the transport of each phase and other auxiliary\nequations. The equations are solved by finite-differences using a procedure implicit in pressure and\nexplicit in saturation. The validation of the model is achieved through comparing the modeling\nresults with CMG simulators and BuckleyeLeverett theory. The results of modeling showed good\nagreement with CMG results, and the comparison with BuckleyeLeverett theory is explained according to different assumptions. After validation of the model, in order to investigate sensitivity\nanalysis, the effects of system variables (partition coefficient, surface tension, oil viscosity and\nsurface injection concentration) and performance variable (cumulative oil recovery) are studied.\nFinally, the comparison of oil recovery between water-flooding and surfactant-flooding was done.\nThe results showed higher oil recovery with changes in capillary number when the partition coefficient is greater than unity. Increasing oil viscosity resulted in decreasing the oil recovery by\nchanging in fractional flow. Moreover, it was concluded that the oil recovery was enhanced by\nincreasing surfactant injection concentration. The oil recovery was increased when surfactant was", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SADEGH KESHTKAR [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Morteza Sabeti", "Amir H.
