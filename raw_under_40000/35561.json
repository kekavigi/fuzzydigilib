{"Nomor": 35561, "Judul": "Simultaneous determination of carbamazepine-N-glucuronide and carbamazepine phase I metabolites in the wastewater by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry", "Abstrak": "Carbamazepine (CBZ) is one of the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. In the\nhuman body, CBZ is metabolized and transformed into a variety of metabolites. Among metabolites, CBZ Nglucuronide (CBZ-Glu, Phase II metabolite) was discharged into sewage system together with Phase I metabolites\nsuch as 2-hydroxycarbamazepine (2-OH-CBZ), 3-hydroxycarbamazepine (3-OH-CBZ), 10-hydroxycarbamazepine (10-OH-CBZ), 10,11-Dihydroxycarbamazepine (DiOH-CBZ), and carbamazepine 10,11-epoxide (EP-CBZ). However, the occurrence of CBZ-Glu in wastewater was not reported previously due to the lack\nof CBZ-Glu standard. In this study, a quantitative analytical method using liquid chromatography-tandem mass\nspectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was developed for the determination of CBZ-Glu as well as other CBZ metabolites in\nwastewater. In the developed method, sufficiently high extraction efficiencies of CBZ and its metabolites were\nachieved by solid phase extraction (SPE) process (recoveries ranged from 79.3% to 95.8%, and from 84.4% to\n96.4% in wastewater influent and effluent, respectively). The concentration of CBZ-Glu in the wastewater influent and effluent were 59.4, and 48.1 ng/L, respectively. CBZ in the wastewater influent and effluent were\n53.8, and 61.9 ng/L, respectively. Although CBZ and phase I metabolites were persistent during the A2O process,\ndeconjugation of CBZ-Glu was suspected to contribute to the increase of CBZ.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Kai He [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Takashi Yonetani., Yasuhiro Asada.,Shinya Echigo.,, Sadahiko Itoh"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "LC-MS/MS Carbamazepine-N-glucuronide Phase I metabolites Wastewater", "Sumber": "Microchemical Journal 145 (2019) 1191\u20131198", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Feb 2019"}
