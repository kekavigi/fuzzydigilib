{"Nomor": 32944, "Judul": "Relationship between microseismic activities and mining parameters during deep mining process", "Abstrak": "Under the high in-situ stress environment in deep mines, stress and strain energy will be released after blasts. The\nranges of rock mass deformation and fracture are closely related to the mining parameters. In this work, a highprecision MS technique and laser-scanning instrument were used to monitor the entire mining process in a typical deep stope. Each blasting process strongly disturbed the surrounding rock mass and induced a great of cracks.\nThe stress and deformation calculated from the MS data offer useful information on stress and deformation for\nevaluating the rock mass stability and can reflect differences in the integrity and deterioration degree of different\nareas of the rock mass. MS parameters including the amount of MS events, energy released, volume of displacement and stress redistribution have a high linear dependence on the volume of ore mined out. Using qualitative\nanalysis, mining sequences and blasting parameters optimization via the equivalent stress calculated from MS\ndata can reduce the rock mass overbreak and underbreak, i.e., ore dilution and loss, and also reduce explosive\nconsumption and blasting vibration, which are beneficial for maintaining rock mass stability.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Liu Jian-po [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Li Yuan-hui and Xu Shi-da"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Microseismic (MS) monitoring, High in-situ stress, Mining sequence optimization, Rock mass stability, Blasting parameters", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 159 (2018) 814\u2013823, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Jan 2019"}
