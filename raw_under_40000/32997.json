{"Nomor": 32997, "Judul": "Efficient 3D inversion of potential field data using fast proximal objective function optimization algorithm", "Abstrak": "One of the key issues in three-dimensional (3D) potential field data inversion is computational efficiency. We\nhave developed an efficient 3D potential field data inversion method using fast proximal objective function\n(FPOF) optimization algorithm. A distinguishing feature of the proposed inversion method is to calculate each\nunknown element in the model space independently at each iteration. In addition, based on subsequent data\nmisfits in the iterative process, we design a computationally efficient method to choose an appropriate regularization\nparameter. We take gravity data inversion as an example and apply the proposed inversion method to\nsynthetic data contaminated with noise. The results demonstrate that the proposed method provides almost\nidentical results as the conventional conjugate gradient (CG) method, however, with a significant reduction in\nthe execution time. Lastly, an application on real field data acquired in the Western China is carried out, yielding\na 3D density model which is in good agreement with the available geological knowledge.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Guomin Peng  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zhan Liu, Kaijun Xu, Yongliang Bai, Runlin Du"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "3D inversion Potential field Fast proximal objective function optimization", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 159 (2018) 108\u2013115, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.08.002", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Jan 2019"}
