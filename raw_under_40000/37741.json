{"Nomor": 37741, "Judul": "Natural orbitals for ab initio no-core shell model calculations", "Abstrak": "We explore the impact of optimizations of the single-particle basis on the convergence behavior and robustness of ab initio no-core shell model calculations of nuclei. Our focus is on novel basis sets defined by the natural orbitals of a correlated one-body density matrix that is obtained in second-order many-body perturbation theory. Using a perturbatively improved density matrix as the starting point informs the single-particle basis about the dominant correlation effects on the global structure of the many-body state, while keeping the computational cost for the basis optimization at a minimum. Already the comparison of the radial single-particle wave functions reveals the superiority of the natural-orbital basis compared to a Hartree-Fock or harmonic oscillator basis, and it highlights pathologies of the Hartree-Fock basis. We compare the model-space convergence of energies, root-mean-square radii, and selected electromagnetic observables for all three basis sets for selected p-shell nuclei using chiral interactions with explicit three-nucleon terms. In all cases the natural-orbital basis provides the fastest and most robust convergence, making it the most efficient basis for no-core shell model calculations.\nAs an application we present no-core shell model calculations for the ground-state energies of all oxygen isotopes and assess the accuracy of the normal-ordered two-body approximation of the three-nucleon interaction in the natural-orbital basis.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Alexander Tichai [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Julius M\u00fcller,", "Klaus Vobig,", "and Robert Roth"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW C 99, 034321 (2019); \u00a92019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Apr 2019"}
