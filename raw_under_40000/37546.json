{"Nomor": 37546, "Judul": "Facile and Equipment-Free Data Encryption and Decryption by Self-Encrypting Pt(II) Complex", "Abstrak": "Luminescence switching materials are vital tovarious data security-related techniques, including dataencryption?decryption. Here, we report a family ofpseudopolymorphs based on a diimine?platinum(II) com-plex, Pt(Me3SiC?CbpyC?CSiMe3)(C?CC6H4Br-3)2(1),and systematically studied the influence of stacking modes onluminescence switching behaviors. Upon exposure to heat ortetrahydrofuran vapor, these pseudopolymorphs exhibitunusual stacking mode-intervened luminescence switching(SMILS) property that non-columnar and quasi-columnarpseudopolymorphs undergo single- and multi-step conversion processes, respectively, to the same non-columnar products.Systematic studies revealed that the unique SMILS behavior is caused by the existence of stable intermediate products as well asdifferent conversion processes of pseudopolymorphs with distinct stacking modes. Such a new property leads to the self-encryption function of1, which is very important for improving the existing data encryption?decryption technique. On thisbasis, we developed a facile, reusable, equipment-free technique with1as the only starting material and realized dataencryption?decryption successfully.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Jiajia_Kang_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164920"}, "Penulis": "Jiajia Kang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jun Ni,Mengmeng Su,Yanqin Li,Jianjun Zhang,Huajun Zhou,Zhong-Ning Chen"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "Pt(II) complex, self-encryption, stacking mode-intervened luminescence switching, data encryption?decryption,equipment-free", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
