{"Nomor": 33385, "Judul": "p-BAND ENGINEERING IN ARTIFICIAL ELECTRONIC LATTICES", "Abstrak": "Artificial electronic lattices, created atom by atom in a scanning tunneling microscope, have emerged as\na highly tunable platform to realize and characterize the lowest-energy bands of novel lattice geometries.\nHere, we show that artificial electronic lattices can be tailored to exhibit higher-energy bands. We study\np-like bands in fourfold and threefold rotationally symmetric lattices. In addition, we show how an\nanisotropic design can be used to lift the degeneracy between px- and py-like bands. The experimental\nmeasurements are corroborated by muffin-tin and tight-binding calculations. The approach to engineer\nhigher-energy electronic bands in artificial quantum systems introduced here enables the realization of\ncomplex band structures from the bottom up.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "M.
