{"Nomor": 34489, "Judul": "Characterization of aerobic granular sludge used for the treatment of petroleum wastewater", "Abstrak": "The application of aerobic granular sludge (AGS) is a promising biological method for wastewater treatment. In\nthe present study, the AGS method was used for the treatment of petroleum wastewater. The granulation process\nand organic/nitrogen compound removal efficiencies were determined and correlated with the microbiological\ncommunities. Granulation of the aerobic sludge occurred after 35 days of operation. The compacted granules had\na diameter of 0.46\u20130.9 mm. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) contents increased as granulation progressed and reached 128 mg/g\u00b7VSS. The granulated sludge efficiently reduced COD by 95% and petroleum\ncompound contents by 90%. NH4\n+-N and TN removal were inefficient due to the inhibition of nitrobacteria and\ndenitrificans, but were significantly improved by the addition of glucose. The microorganisms in the granules\ncapable of degrading petroleum chemicals consisted of the genera Propioniciclava, Micropruina,\nAlphaproteobacteria, Flavobacterium, and Sulfuritalea.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Chunmao Chen [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jie Ming.,Brandon A.
