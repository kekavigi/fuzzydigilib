{"Nomor": 37764, "Judul": "Four-Body Scale in Universal Few-Boson Systems", "Abstrak": "The role of an intrinsic four-body scale in universal few-boson systems is the subject of active debate.\nWe study these systems within the framework of effective field theory. For systems of up to six bosons we\nestablish that no four-body scale appears at leading order (LO). However, we find that at next-to-leading\norder (NLO) a four-body force is needed to obtain renormalized results for binding energies. With the\nassociated parameter fixed to the binding energy of the four-boson system, this force is shown to\nrenormalize the five- and six-body systems as well. We present an original ansatz for the short-distance\nlimit of the bosonic A-body wave function from which we conjecture that new A-body scales appear at\nNA?3 LO. As a specific example, calculations are presented for clusters of helium atoms. Our results apply more generally to other few-body systems governed by a large scattering length, such as light nuclei and halo states, the low-energy properties of which are independent of the detailed internal structure of the constituents.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "B.
