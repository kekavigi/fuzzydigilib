{"Nomor": 32988, "Judul": "PREDICTIVE SIMULATIONS OF IONIZATION ENERGIES OF SOLVATED HALIDE IONS WITH RELATIVISTIC EMBEDDED EQUATION OF MOTION COUPLED CLUSTER THEORY", "Abstrak": "A subsystem approach for obtaining electron binding energies in the valence region is presented and\napplied to the case of halide ions \u00f0X?; X \u00bc F ? At\u00de in water. This approach is based on electronic structure calculations combining the relativistic equation-of-motion coupled cluster method for electron detachment and density functional theory via the frozen density embedding approach, using structures from classical molecular dynamics with polarizable force fields for discrete systems (in our study, droplets containing the anion and 50 water molecules). Our results indicate that one can accurately capture both\nthe large solvent effect observed for the halides and the splitting of their ionization signals due to the\nincreasingly large spin-orbit coupling of the p3=2-p1=2 manifold across the series, at an affordable\ncomputational cost. Furthermore, owing to the quantum mechanical treatment of both solute and solvent\nelectron binding energies of semiquantitative quality are also obtained for (bulk) water as by-products of\nthe calculations for the halogens (in droplets).", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "YASSINE BOUCHAFRA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["AVIJIT SHEE,", "FLORENT R\u00b4EAL,", "VAL\u00b4ERIE VALLET,", "AND ANDR\u00b4E SEVERO PEREIRA GOMES"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 121, 266001 (2018), \u00a9 2018 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Jan 2019"}
