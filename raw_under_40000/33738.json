{"Nomor": 33738, "Judul": "RESOLVED SIMULATIONS OF SEDIMENTING SUSPENSIONS OF SPHERES", "Abstrak": "Several results on sedimenting equal spheres obtained by resolved simulations with the\nPhysalis method are presented. The volume fraction ranges from 8.7% to 34.9% and the\nparticle Galilei number from 49.7 to 99.4. The results shown concern particle collisions,\ndiffusivities, the mean free path, the particle pair distribution function, and other features.\nIt is found that many qualitative trends found in earlier studies continue to hold in the\nparameter range investigated here as well. The analysis of collisions reveals that particles\ninteract prevalently via their flow fields rather than by direct contacts. A tendency toward\nparticle clustering is demonstrated. The time evolution of the shape and size of particle\ntetrads is examined.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "DANIEL P.
