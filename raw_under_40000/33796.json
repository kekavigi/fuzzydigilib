Thus, we can achieve fine pore evaluation in fracture\u2013vug reservoirs based on electric imaging\nlogging data. We automatically identify and extract fracture\u2013vug information from the electric imaging images by adopting\na path morphological operator that remains flexible enough to fit rectilinear and slightly curved structures because they are\nindependent of the structuring element shape. The Otsu method was used to extract fracture\u2013vug information from the\nbackground noise caused by the matrix. To accommodate the differences in scale and form of the different target regions,\nincluding fracture and vug path, operators with different lengths were selected for their recognition and extraction at the\ncorresponding scale. Polynomial and elliptic functions are used to fit the extracted fractures and vugs, respectively, and the\nfracture\u2013vug parameters are deduced from the fitted edge. Finally, test examples of numerical simulation data and several\nmeasured well data have been provided for the verification of the effectiveness and adaptability of the path morphology\nmethod in the application of electric imaging logging data processing. This also provides algorithm support for the fine\nevaluation of fracture\u2013vug reservoirs.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "XI-NING LI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jin-Song Shen", "Wu-Yang Yang", "Zhen-Ling Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Path morphology, Image automatic identification, Electric imaging logging, Fracture\u2013vug reservoir", "Sumber": "Petroleum Science (2019) 16:58\u201376 https://doi.org/10.1007/s12182-018-0282-6(0123456789().,-volV)(0123456789().,-volV)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Jan 2019"}
