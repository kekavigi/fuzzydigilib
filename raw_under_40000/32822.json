{"Nomor": 32822, "Judul": "A cholera epidemic model in a spatiotemporally heterogeneous environment", "Abstrak": "The transmission of cholera, a water- and food-borne intestinal infection, involves\ncomplex interactions among human hosts, pathogens, and the environment, and\nis impacted by the spatial variation and seasonal fluctuation. In this paper, we\npropose a new deterministic model to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of\ncholera transmission. The model employs a reaction\u2013convection\u2013diffusion system\nto represent the spatial movement of the hosts and pathogens, and incorporates\ntime-periodic parameters to describe the seasonality of the disease transmission\nand bacterial growth rates. Using the theory of principle eigenvalues, we define\nand analyze the basic reproduction number of this model, based on which we\nestablish the threshold type results for cholera transmission in a spatiotemporally\nheterogeneous environment.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xueying Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiao-Qiang Zhao., Jin Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Cholera models Spatiotemporally heterogeneous environments Threshold dynamics", "Sumber": "J.
