{"Nomor": 35758, "Judul": "FROM DIRAC SEMIMETALS TO TOPOLOGICAL PHASES IN THREE DIMENSIONS:A COUPLED-WIRE CONSTRUCTION", "Abstrak": "Weyl and Dirac (semi)metals in three dimensions have robust gapless electronic band structures.\nTheir massless single-body energy spectra are protected by symmetries such as lattice translation,\n(screw) rotation, and time reversal. In this paper, we discuss many-body interactions in these systems.\nWe focus on strong interactions that preserve symmetries and are outside the single-body mean-field\nregime. By mapping a Dirac (semi)metal to a model based on a three-dimensional array of coupled\nDirac wires, we show (1) the Dirac (semi)metal can acquire a many-body excitation energy gap without\nbreaking the relevant symmetries, and (2) interaction can enable an anomalous Weyl (semi)metallic\nphase that is otherwise forbidden by symmetries in the single-body setting and can only be present\nholographically on the boundary of a four-dimensional weak topological insulator. Both of these\ntopological states support fractional gapped (gapless) bulk (respectively, boundary) quasiparticle\nexcitations.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SYED RAZA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["ALEXANDER SIROTA,", "AND JEFFREY C.
