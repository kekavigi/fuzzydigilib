In growing number of countries, S&T indicators have been developed as a tool to analyse the performance of their respective National Innovation System (NIS). Malaysia has started to develop S&T indicator in 1992 and periodically conducted improvement. Japan has started to develope S&T indicator arround 1980 and published it once in every 3 or 4 year. In Indonesia, although the country\u2019s S&T indicator has for the fisrt time been compiled in 1993, the development of the indicator has been relatively slow, both in institutionalization aspect and in content aspect. As perceived by some relevant experts, S&T indicator in Indonesia is incomplete, and this could result that Indonesia\u2019s S&T policy do not have accurate information basis regarding the actual condition of the country\u2019s S&T. This thesis research aims to identify elements and institutional apsects of S&T indicator, whose development is regarded crucial to support the performance of Indonesia\u2019s NIS. By employing qualitative approach, the conduction of this research was guided by the following questions:\n- How has the Indonesia\u2019s S&T indicator grown within the period 1993-2004, in terms of its contents and its institutional setting;\n- How has such a growth pattern been influenced by dynamic interaction between various S&T actors and by the differences of perspective among those actors.\nThe result of this research indicates that the differences of perspective among actors regarding the social role of S&T considerably influence the preferred contents of S&T indicator, and how it is institutionalized for maintenance and management purposes. The main issue for future development of Indonesia\u2019s S&T indicator is to establish an agreement about the strategic role of S&T within the context of national development.", "Daftar File": {"2006_TS_PP_SAMIRAN_1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/150587", "2006_TS_PP_SAMIRAN_1-BAB_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/150588", "2006_TS_PP_SAMIRAN_1-BAB_2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/150589", "2006_TS_PP_SAMIRAN_1-BAB_3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/150590", "2006_TS_PP_SAMIRAN_1-BAB_4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/150591", "2006_TS_PP_SAMIRAN_1-BAB_5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/150592", "2006_TS_PP_SAMIRAN_1-BAB_6.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/150593", "2006_TS_PP_SAMIRAN_1-BAB_1DAFTAR_PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/150594", "2006_TS_PP_SAMIRAN_1-LAMPIRAN.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/150595"}, "Penulis": "Samiran [24004012]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
