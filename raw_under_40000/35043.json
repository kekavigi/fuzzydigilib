{"Nomor": 35043, "Judul": "Efficiency of wastewater treatment facilities: The influence of scale economies", "Abstrak": "The water cycle, from catchment to discharge, is a sector that involves an important investment and operation\nand maintenance costs. In particular, sewage treatment is a challenge for governments because they are having\nto consider economic, environmental, and social aspects. Within the European Union, implementation of\nDirective 91/271/EEC is responsible for the location of wastewater treatment facilities in the territory, due to the\nrequirement that all urban areas must have this infrastructure to reduce the environmental impact of treated\nwater in water bodies. Different sizes of municipalities affect the design of each wastewater treatment plant\n(WWTP) and cause variations in the operation process. The presence of scale economies in this sector has a\nsignificant influence on the efficiency of the wastewater treatment process and has a direct impact on the operational costs. Based on the pursuit of economic and environmental efficiency, this analysis extends the scope of\nthe current literature because it recommends a specific, population equivalent (p.e.) range for which it would be\nsuitable to achieve efficiency in wastewater treatment facilities\u2014shedding light on the open debate about scale\neconomies in WWTPs.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Vicent Hern\u00e1ndez-Chover [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["\u00c1gueda Bellver-Domingo., Francesc Hern\u00e1ndez-Sancho"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Scale economies Efficiency Data envelopment analysis (DEA) Energy Population equivalent Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP)", "Sumber": "Journal of Environmental Management 228 (2018) 77\u201384", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Feb 2019"}
