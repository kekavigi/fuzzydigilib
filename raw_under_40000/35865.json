{"Nomor": 35865, "Judul": "Emerging contaminants in a river receiving untreated wastewater from an Indian urban centre", "Abstrak": "Research over the last decade on emerging trace organic contaminants in aquatic systems has largely focused on\nsources such as treated wastewaters in high income countries, with relatively few studies relating to wastewater\nsources of these contaminants in low and middle income countries. We undertook a longitudinal survey of the\nAhar River for a number of emerging organic contaminants (including pharmaceuticals, hormones, personal\ncare products and industrial chemicals) which flows through the city of Udaipur, India. Udaipur is a city of approximately 450,000 people with no wastewater treatment occurring at the time of this survey. We found the\nconcentrations of many of the contaminants within the river water were similar to those commonly reported\nin untreated wastewater in high income countries. For example, concentrations of pharmaceuticals, such as carbamazepine, antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ranged up to 1900 ng/L. Other organic contaminants, such as steroid estrogens (up to 124 ng/L), steroid androgens (up to 1560 ng/L), benzotriazoles (up to\n11 ?g/L), DEET (up to 390 ng/L), BPA (up to 300 ng/L) and caffeine (up to 37.5 ?g/L), were all similar to previously\nreported concentrations in wastewaters in high income countries. An assessment of the population densities in\nthe watersheds feeding into the river showed increasing population density of a watershed led to a corresponding downstream increase in the concentrations of the organic contaminants, with quantifiable concentrations\nstill present up to 10 km downstream of the areas directly adjacent to the highest population densities. Overall,\nthis study highlights how a relatively clean river can be contaminated by untreated wastewater released from an\nurban centre.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mike Williams [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Rai S.
