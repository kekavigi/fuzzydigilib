{"Nomor": 33729, "Judul": "Microplastic ingestion by riverine macroinvertebrates", "Abstrak": "Although microplastics are a recognised pollutant in marine environments, less attention has been directed towards freshwater ecosystems despite their greater proximity to possible plastic sources. Here, we quantify the\npresence of microplastic particles (MPs) in river organisms upstream and downstream of five UK Wastewater\nTreatment Works (WwTWs). MPs were identified in approximately 50% of macroinvertebrate samples collected\n(Baetidae, Heptageniidae and Hydropsychidae) at concentrations up to 0.14 MP mg tissue?1 and they occurred at\nall sites. MP abundance was associated with macroinvertebrate biomass and taxonomic family, but MPs occurred\nindependently of feeding guild and biological traits such as habitat affinity and ecological niche. There was no increase in plastic ingestion downstream of WwTW discharges averaged across sites, but MP abundance in macroinvertebrates marginally increased where effluent discharges contributed more to total runoff and declined with\nincreasing river discharge. The ubiquity of microplastics within macroinvertebrates in this case study reveals a\npotential risk from MPs entering riverine food webs through at least two pathways, involving detritivory and\nfilter-feeding, and we recommend closer attention to freshwater ecosystems in future research", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Fredric M.
