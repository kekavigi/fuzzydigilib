{"Nomor": 38237, "Judul": "Macroscopic Electron Quantum Coherence in a Solid-State Circuit", "Abstrak": "The quantum coherence of electronic quasiparticles underpins many of the emerging transport properties of conductors at small scales. Novel electronic implementations of quantum optics devices are now available with perspectives such as \u201cflying-qubit\u201d manipulations. However, electronic quantum interferences in conductors remained up to now limited to propagation paths shorter than 30 ?m independent of the material. Here we demonstrate strong electronic quantum interferences after a propagation along two 0.1-mm-long pathways in a circuit. Interferences of visibility as high as 80% and 40% are observed on electronic analogues of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer of, respectively, 24-?m and 0.1-mm arm length, consistently corresponding to a 0.25-mm electronic phase coherence length. While such devices perform best in the integer quantum Hall regime at filling factor 2, the electronic interferences are restricted by the Coulomb interaction between copropagating edge channels. We overcome this limitation by closing the inner channel in micron-scale loops of frozen internal degrees of freedom combined with a loop-closing strategy providing an essential isolation from the environment.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "H.
