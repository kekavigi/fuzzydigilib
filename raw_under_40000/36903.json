We proposed the pre-coagulation of municipal wastewater with polymerized titanium based coagulants,\nfollowed by direct crossflow ultrafiltration for water reuse by avoiding biological treatment. Compared with\npolymerized aluminum chloride (PAC), polymerized ferric sulfate (PFS) and polymerized titanium sulfate (PTS),\nthe polymerized titanium chloride (PTC) achieved higher coagulation efficiency, with chemical oxygen demand\n(COD) and total phosphorus (TP) removal reached 80.5% and 99.1%, respectively. Besides, PTC produced larger\nflocs (median equivalent diameter of 1408.1 ?m) with better settling ability (flocs sedimentation in 1 min),\nhigher shear resistance (strength factor reached 95.87%) and stronger re-aggregation capability (recover factor\nof 225.13%). The subsequent direct crossflow ultrafiltration of primary settled municipal wastewater could\nachieve complete suspended solids and P removal, being accompanied by additional 10\u201315% of organics removal.\nSpecifically, ultrafiltration of PTC effluent obtained larger permeate flux up to 499.5 Lm?2 h?1 and the\nreused water having higher quality (COD removal of 90.4%). Current study demonstrated the feasibility and\nsuperiority of utilizing polymerized titanium salts (especially PTC) for preliminary treatment of municipal\nwastewater. The resultant high-quality effluent through direct ultrafiltration provides alternative schemes for\nthe demanding reclaimed wastewater reuse.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yan-xia Zhao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiao-yan Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Polymerized titanium salts Municipal wastewater Coagulation Crossflow filtration Membrane fouling", "Sumber": "Separation and Purification Technology 211 (2019) 207\u2013217", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi \u00a0\n                                     Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Mar 2019"}
