{"Nomor": 37452, "Judul": "Enhanced Performance of a CVD MoS2Photodetector by Chemicalin Situ n?Type Doping", "Abstrak": "Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) area category of promising two-dimensional (2D) materials forthe optoelectronic devices, and their unique characteristicsinclude tunable band gap, nondangling bonds as well ascompatibility to large-scale fabrication, for instance, chemicalvapor deposition (CVD). MoS2is one of thefirst TMDs thatis well studied in the photodetection area widely. However,the low photoresponse restricts its applications in photo-detectors unless the device is applied with ultrahigh source?drain voltage (VDS) and gate voltage (VGS). In this work, the photoresponse of a MoS2photodetector was improved by achemicalin situdoping method using gold chloride hydrate. The responsivity and specific detectivity were increased to 99.9 A/W and 9.4\u00d71012Jones under lowVDS(0.1 V) andVGS(0 V), which are 14.6 times and 4.8 times higher than those of a pristinephotodetector, respectively. The photoresponse enhancement results from chlorine n-type doping in CVD MoS2which reducesthe trapping of photoinduced electrons and promotes the photogating effect. This novel doping strategy leads to greatapplications of high-performance MoS2photodetectors potentially and opens a new avenue to enhance photoresponse for other2D materials", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Songyu_Li_11.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164487"}, "Penulis": "Songyu Li  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Famin Liu,Songyu Li,Yongfeng Chen,Beiyun Liu,Wenjie Deng, Boxing An,Feihong Chu,Guoqing Zhang,Shanlin LiXuhong Li,Yongzhe ZhangYongzhe Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "MoS2, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), in situ n-type doping, photodetector, photogating effec", "Sumber": ":ACS Appl.
