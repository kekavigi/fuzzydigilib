{"Nomor": 37468, "Judul": "Thermoelectric Enhancement of Silicon Membranes by UltrathinAmorphous Films", "Abstrak": "We propose a simple, low-cost, and large-area method to increase thethermoelectricfigure of merit (ZT) in silicon membranes by the deposition of an ultrathinaluminum layer. Transmission electron microscopy showed that short deposition ofaluminum on a silicon substrate covers the surface with an ultrathin amorphousfilm, which,according to recent theoretical works, efficiently destroys phonon wave packets. As a result,we measured 30?40% lower thermal conductivity in silicon membranes covered withaluminumfilms while the electrical conductivity was not affected. Thus, we have achieved40?45% higher ZT values in membranes covered with aluminumfilms. To demonstrate apractical application, we applied this method to enhance the performance of a silicon membrane-based thermoelectric deviceand measured 42% higher power generation.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Anthony_George_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/164522"}, "Penulis": "Anthony George [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ryoto Yanagisawa,Roman Anufriev,Jinghan He,Naoko Yoshie,Naohito Tsujii,Quansheng Guo,Takao Mori,Sebastian Volz,Masahiro Nomura"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "thermoelectrics, phonon engineering, silicon, thermal conductivity,figure of merit", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
