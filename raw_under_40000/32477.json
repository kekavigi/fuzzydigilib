{"Nomor": 32477, "Judul": "Helical-Contact Deformation Measuring Method In Oil\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdGas Pipelines", "Abstrak": "With the rapid increase in oil and gas consumption in the world\u2019s\nenergy consumption structure, the pace of global oil\u2013gas pipeline\nconstruction has accelerated. Pipeline accidents that cause huge\neconomic losses occur frequently, so inspection and maintenance\nof oil and gas pipelines have become critical issues. This paper\npresents a helical-contact deformation measuring method based on\na multi-purpose helical drive in-pipe robot that can be used in\nharsh 3D unknown enclosed near-circular environments, such as\noil\u2013gas pipelines. This measuring device has a simple structure\nand does not need an additional driving module to rotate the\nmeasuring device. The device can rotate together with the robot\u2019s\ndriving wheels and measure pipe diameters ranging from 180 mm to\n210 mm. Eccentricity analysis and simulation are also conducted.\nExperiments in Plexiglas pipe are carried out to draw the pipe shape\nand test the eccentricity of the measuring device.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "YUJIA LI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Qingyou Liu :  Yonghua Chen", "Ming Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Robot, measurement, helical contact, deformation, oil\u2013gas, pipeline", "Sumber": "International Journal of Robotics and Automation, Vol. 32, No. 1, 2017 http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=0&sid=a43c40e7-5c3a-4a11-ad0d-e6f1431b1903%40pdc-v-sessmgr05", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
