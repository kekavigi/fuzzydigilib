{"Nomor": 32902, "Judul": "Accurate and efficient computations of phase-changing flows in thermal vapor compressors", "Abstrak": "This paper focuses on the limitations of single-phase computations which have been widely applied to\nthe numerical simulations of flow fields around thermal vapor compressors (TVCs), and provides computational\nimprovements through multi-phase flow modeling and analysis. In order to capture the multiphase\nflow physics accurately and provide reliable results, several numerical methods and models,\nincluding the shock-stable multi-phase AUSMPW+ scheme, phase-changing models, cell-by-cell adaptive\nmesh refinement technique, and the IAPWS-97 equation of states, are combined into a numerical solver.\nWe then simulate various TVC systems and compare the computed system performance and local flow\nphysics between the single- and multi-phase computations. Based on the computational results and comparisons,\nwe examine phase-changing process and its influence on two major local physical features,\nnamely shock-train region and shear layer.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Daeho Min [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hyeongjun Kim, Hoon Lee, Chaesoo Lee , Chongam Kim"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "thermal vapor compressors", "Sumber": "Science Direct", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Jan 2019"}
