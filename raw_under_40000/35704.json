{"Nomor": 35704, "Judul": "A Bioinspired Scaffold with Anti-Inflammatory Magnesium Hydroxide and Decellularized Extracellular Matrix for Renal Tissue Regeneration", "Abstrak": "Kidney diseases are a worldwide public health issue. Renal tissue regeneration using functional scaffolds with\nbiomaterials has attracted a great deal of attention due to limited donor organ availability. Here, we developed a\nbioinspired scaffold that can efficiently induce renal tissue regeneration. The bioinspired scaffold was designed with mpoly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2), and decellularized renal extracellular matrix (ECM).", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Eugene Lih [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wooram Park, Ki Wan Park, So Young Chun, Hyuncheol Kim,  Yoon Ki Joung, Tae Gyun Kwon, Jeffrey A.
