{"Nomor": 34448, "Judul": "Design and handicrafts: The importance of  interdisciplinarity in collaborative design practice", "Abstrak": "The  focus  of  this  article  is  on  the  relationship  between  design  and  craftsmanship  in  the  Brazilian  scenario  of  social  projects  with craft production. It presents the importance of collective and collaborative actions as forms of mediation in this scenario. \nThe article argues that in order to develop a design mindset that expands beyond projective practices and takes into account the social and political context for more sustainable solutions in environmental, social and economic levels, the mediation has to be collaborative. In the paper, a parallel is outlined between this collective, collaborative and complex work of design and the multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches. To address the complexity of this subject, practical examples are identified to show the important strategic role that the designer plays in these social innovation processes.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Luiz Lagares Izidio [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["B\u00e1rbara de Oliveira Cruz, Rita Maria Couto,  Luiza Novaes, Jackeline Lima Farbiarz"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "crafts, collaborative design, social innovation, interdisciplinarity.", "Sumber": "Design and handicrafts: The importance of  interdisciplinarity in collaborative design practice", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Feb 2019"}
