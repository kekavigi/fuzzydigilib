{"Nomor": 33084, "Judul": "Accelerating full waveform inversion using HSS solver and limited memory conjugate gradient method", "Abstrak": "Full waveform inversion (FWI) consists in finding an accurate optimal model of the subsurface from local measurements of the seismic wavefield. This aim is achieved by minimizing the difference between the observed\nand predicted data, starting from an initial estimation of the subsurface parameters. One challenge for FWI is\nits intensive large-scale wavefield simulations, which seriously restricts its wide applications. Additionally, due\nto the ill-posedness of FWI problem, when the nonlinear conjugate gradient method is employed, the current\ngradient often lies in the space spanned by the previous directions, resulting in very slow convergence. In this\npaper, a limited memory version conjugate gradient method equipped with the scalable HSS-structured\nmultifrontal solver is applied to efficiently solve the FWI problem. A hierarchically preconditioned scheme is considered to enhance the robustness of the inversion algorithm. Numerical experiments including 2D and 3D are\nillustrated to show the performances of this high efficient inversion algorithm", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Qinglong He  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Bo Han"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Full waveform inversion Hierarchically semi-separable matrix Conjugate gradient method Limited memory Seismic imaging", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 159 (2018) 83\u201392, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.07.022", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Jan 2019"}
