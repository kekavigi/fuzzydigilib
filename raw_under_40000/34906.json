Mihai Eminescu in the Mirror of Fine \nArts)   is   structured   and   elaborated,   the   recorded   illustrations   and   references  having  for  a  source  Romanian  and  foreign  periodicals  from  the  interval  1939\u20131989.

Wishing to mirror  the  mentioned  chapter,  the  article  surveys  all  its  sections  and  \nsubsections \u2013, from photographic documents to exhibitions on Eminescu, going through the representations of the poet and his work (as a source of inspiration,   evidently)   in   painting,   graphic   and   decorative   art,   and   sculpture \u2013, offering only those elements which can throw at least a slight ray of light on the bibliographer\u2019s complex work. This work ranges from investigating  a  periodical  to  the  identification  of  an  artist  or  an  artistic  technique,  from  the  simple  application  of  some  consecrated  norms  to  one\u2019s  own  \u201cview\u201d  of  how  the  information  must  be communicated  to  those ready to receive it.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Tudor George, Pereverza [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Mihai Eminescu \u2013 photography and fine arts; bibliography \u2013  Mihai  Eminescu;  portraits  \u2013  Mihai  Eminescu;  Eminescu\u2019s  iconography;   Mihai Eminescu;  Ramuri  review;  Manuscriptum  review", "Sumber": "Mihai Eminescu \u2013 photography and fine arts; bibliography \u2013  Mihai  Eminescu;  portraits  \u2013  Mihai  Eminescu;  Eminescu\u2019s  iconography;   Mihai Eminescu;  Ramuri  review;  Manuscriptum  review", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos \u00a0\n                                     Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Feb 2019"}
