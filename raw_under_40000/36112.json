{"Nomor": 36112, "Judul": "Smart NIR-Light-Mediated Nanotherapeutic Agents for EnhancingTumor Accumulation and Overcoming Hypoxia in SynergisticCancer Therapy", "Abstrak": "The efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) still shows limited success inclinical application due to hypoxia in the solid tumor, low tumor accumulation andlimited light penetration depth of photosensitizers (PS). The previously reported MnO2-based nanotherapeutic agents always required intratumoral injection or complex targetingmodification process to improve the therapeutic efficacy. Herein, new MnO2-basednanotherapeutic agents (honeycomb MnO2/IR780/BSA nanoparticles, HMIB NPs) aredesigned and prepared to achieve excellent phototherapeutic performance characterizedby NIR-light-mediation, deep diffusion via TME response and O2self-supply. The ex vivoand in vivo NIRfluorescence imaging results demonstrate that the honeycombnanostructure of HMIB NPs facilitates the high tumor accumulation of hydrophobicIR780 via enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect after intravenous injection.The immunofluorescence results demonstrate that the TME response of HMIB NPs notonly provides O2for relieving hypoxia but also reduces size for improving deepintratumoral diffusion. As a result, under the synergy of NIRfluorescence imaging,photothermal effect and PDT of IR780 with TME responsive size-change, and O2self-supply of honeycomb MnO2, the HMIBNPs have achieved all-in-one NIRfluorescence and photothermal dual-model imaging guided synergistic PDT/PTT under asingle-wavelength NIR light irradiation.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Xiangmei_Liu_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/161628"}, "Penulis": "Xiangmei Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Kang Tian,Jinghui Zhang,Menglong Zhao,Shujuan Liu,Qiang Zhao,Wei Huang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "honeycomb manganese dioxide, hypoxia, nanotherapeutic agents, photodynamic therapy,tumor microenvironment responsive degradation", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
