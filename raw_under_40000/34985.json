{"Nomor": 34985, "Judul": "Logarithmic Query Complexity for Approximate Nash Computation in Large Games", "Abstrak": "We investigate the problem of equilibrium computation for \u201clarge\u201d n-player games. Large games have a Lipschitz-type property that no single player\u2019s utility is greatly affected by any other individual player\u2019s actions. In this paper, we mostly focus on the case where any change of strategy by a player causes other players\u2019 payoffs to change by at most   1n . We study algorithms having query access to the game\u2019s payoff function, aiming to find ?-Nash equilibria. We seek algorithms that obtain ? as small as possible, in time polynomial in n. Our main result is a randomised algorithm that achieves ? approaching   18  for 2-strategy games in a completely uncoupled setting, where each player observes her own payoff to a query, and adjusts her behaviour independently of other players\u2019 payoffs/actions. O(log n) rounds/queries are required. We also show how to obtain a slight improvement over   18 , by introducing a small amount of communication between the players. Finally, we give extension of our results to large games with more than two strategies per player, and alternative largeness parameters.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP PAUL W.
