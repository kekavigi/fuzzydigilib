{"Nomor": 35144, "Judul": "QUANTUM MANY-BODY DYNAMICS OF THE EINSTEIN\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdDE HAAS EFFECT", "Abstrak": "In 1915, Einstein and de Haas and Barnett demonstrated that changing the magnetization of a magnetic\nmaterial results in mechanical rotation and vice versa. At the microscopic level, this effect governs the transfer between electron spin and orbital angular momentum, and lattice degrees of freedom, understanding which is key for molecular magnets, nano-magneto-mechanics, spintronics, and ultrafast magnetism. Until now, the timescales of electron-to-lattice angular momentum transfer remain unclear, since modeling this process on a microscopic level requires the addition of an infinite amount of quantum angular momenta. We show that this problem can be solved by reformulating it in terms of the recently discovered angulon quasiparticles, which results in a rotationally invariant quantum many-body theory. In particular, we demonstrate that nonperturbative effects take place even if the electron-phonon coupling is weak and give rise to angular momentum transfer on femtosecond timescales.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "J.
