{"Nomor": 35003, "Judul": "A precise radiation boundary method for dynamic response of a double-layered tunnel embedded in a layered half-space", "Abstrak": "In the study, a precise radiation boundary method (PRBM) is proposed to analyze the diffraction of elastic wave\nand dynamic stress concentration of a double-layered lining tunnel with a shock-absorbing layer embedded in a\nlayered half-space. The dynamic response of the complex structure is obtained by using a substructure replacement technique, which transforms the complex scattering problem into a simple radiation one. The proposed\nmethod is applied to model the radiation condition of a boundary of a complex structure truncated from a\nmulti-layered half-space in frequency domain. The proposed method is based on the precise integration\nalgorithm which ensues the low computational effort and high accuracy. The accuracy and effectiveness of\nthe proposed method are validated by comparing it with the results of extant studies. Finally, a comprehensive\nparametric study is conducted to investigate the effects of the complex geological structure (impedance ratio\nof layered soil and soft layer on surface) and complex constructions (double-layered lining and shockabsorbing layer) on the dynamic stress concentration of a composite-structure tunnel. The proposed approach\nexhibits a significant ability to analyze the response of a complex underground structure embedded in a layered\nhalf-space", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zhi-yuan Li  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jian-bo Li, Gao Lin"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Precise radiation boundary method Dynamic stress concentration Double-layered tunnel Shock-absorbing layer Multi-layered half-space In-plane waves", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 162 (2019) 93\u2013107, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.11.010", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Feb 2019"}
