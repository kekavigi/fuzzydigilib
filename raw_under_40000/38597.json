{"Nomor": 38597, "Judul": "Catalase Mimic Property of Co3O4 Nanomaterials with Different Morphology and Its Application as a Calcium Sensor", "Abstrak": "The applications of inorganic nanomaterials as\nbiomimetic catalysts are receiving much attention because of\ntheir high stability and low cost. In this work, Co3O4\nnanomaterials including nanoplates, nanorods, and nanocubes\nwere synthesized. The morphologies and compositions of the\nproducts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy,\ntransmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The\ncatalytic properties of Co3O4 nanomaterials as catalase mimics\nwere studied. The Co3O4 materials with different morphology\nexhibited different catalytic activities in the order of nanoplates > nanorods > nanocubes. The difference of the catalytic activities\noriginated from their different abilities of electron transfer. Their catalytic activities increased significantly in the presence of\ncalcium ion. On the basis of the stimulation by calcium ion, a biosensor was constructed by Co3O4 nanoplates for the\ndetermination of calcium ion. The biosensor had a linear relation to calcium concentrations and good measurement correlation\nbetween 0.1 and 1 mM with a detection limit of 4 ?M (S/N = 3). It showed high selectivity against other metal ions and good\nreproducibility. The proposed method was successfully applied for the determination of calcium in a milk sample.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Jianshuai Mu 1.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170030"}, "Penulis": "Jianshuai Mu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Li Zhang, Min Zhao, Yan Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "nanomaterials, catalase mimic, morphology effect, amperometric biosensor, calcium determination", "Sumber": "www.acsami.org", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Mei 2019"}
