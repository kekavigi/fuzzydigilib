{"Nomor": 32566, "Judul": "Physiological state in extreme environments", "Abstrak": "Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) wearable devices are used to quantify physiology during\nphysical activities to monitor levels of fitness and to prevent overexertion. We argue that\nthere are limitations and challenges to measuring physiological data with current stateof-the-art wearable devices, both with the hardware as well as the data itself. These\nlimitations and challenges are exacerbated when wearable devices are used in extreme\nclimate environments We discuss these through empirical findings from our study where\nhikers are suited with wearable technologies as they cross the Grand Canyon. We discuss\nthe performance of various wearable technologies in the extreme environment of the\ncanyon as well as the concerns with downloaded data. These findings highlight the needs\nand opportunities for the wearable devices market, specifically how wearable technologies\ncould mature to quantify performance and fatigue through real-time data collection and\nanalysis.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Glory Emmanuel-Avi\u00f1a [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": [", Kristin Divis.,  , Robert G.
