{"Nomor": 36379, "Judul": "Correlating non-linear behavior of in-plane magnetic field and local domain wall velocities for quantitative stress evaluation", "Abstrak": "There is a need in industry to supply safe, effective and reliable technique to characterize the stress of steel components and structures, both at the manufacturing stage and in service. Bridging the correlation between micro and macro magnetic properties and the applied tensile stress is the first conceptual step to come up with a new method of non-destructive material testing. We investigate the stress-associated changes in domain wall dynamics in grain-oriented electrical steel by in-situ magnetic imaging using magneto-optical indicator films. The 180 domain walls velocity distribution is used as a parameter for applied stress determination. Additionally, the in-plane magnetic stray field above the surface of the sample is synchronously measured for stress evaluation. The variations in magnetic stray field outside the sample under different loading are investigated for the analysis of the domain wall dynamics. From this, an interrelation of the domain wall dynamics and magnetic stray fields with varied tensile stress is derived. The results provide substantial microscopic and macroscopic insight for the interplay of domain\nwall dynamics and stress-induced demagnetizing effect.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Fasheng Qiu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Guiyun Tian,", "Jeffrey McCord,", "Jian Zhao,", "Kun Zeng,", "and Pan Hu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "AIP Advances 9, 015325 (2019); doi: 10.1063/1.5047216", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Mar 2019"}
