{"Nomor": 34517, "Judul": "Response of azimuthal acoustic logging to the fluid-filled strip channel behind a casing pipe", "Abstrak": "One of the most important applications of acoustic well logging is to evaluate the cementation quality in the\ncasing hole; such evaluation is in fact a physical question of detecting the position of the fluid-filled strip channel\nthat is actually distributed in a limited azimuthal and axial zone behind the casing pipe. Currently, a common detection method is to measure the amplitude of the casing wave (ACW) in different azimuths and then reverse the\nposition of the strip channel. Thus, in this paper, a 3D finite-difference algorithm is developed to study the azimuthal distribution of ACW caused by the strip channel. The simulation results show that ACW is affected by\nmany parameters such as the radial position of azimuthal receivers and the azimuthal angle of the strip channel.\nMore importantly, the product of the inner diameter of the casing pipe and the central frequency of the source\nwill determine the azimuthal distribution of ACW: ACW reaches the maximum at the opposite azimuth of the\nstrip channel when the product is below the threshold value, and it reaches the maximum at the central azimuth\nof the strip channel when the product is above the threshold value.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Peng Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xin Zhao, Yufeng Shi, Yiren Fan, Hongliang Wu, Jing Zhao, Qi Mao"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Azimuthal acoustic logging 3D finite-difference Casing wave", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 159 (2018) 268\u2013276, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.09.015", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Feb 2019"}
