{"Nomor": 36767, "Judul": "Application of time-reversal-based processing techniques to enhance detection of GPR targets", "Abstrak": "In this paper we analyze the performance of time-reversal (TR) techniques in conjunction with various Ground\nPenetrating Radar (GPR) pre-processing methods aimed at improving detection of subsurface targets. TR techniques were first developed for ultrasound applications and, by exploiting the invariance of the wave equation\nunder time reversal, can yield features such as superresolution and statistical stability. The TR method was examined here using both synthetic and actual GPR field data under four different pre-processing strategies on the raw\ndata, namely: mean background removal, eigenvalue background removal, a sliding-window space-frequency\ntechnique, and a noise-robust spatial differentiator along the scan direction. Depending on the acquisition\nmode, it was possible to determine with good precision the position and depth of the studied targets as well\nas, in some cases, to differentiate the targets from nearby clutter such as localized geological anomalies. The\nproposed methodology has the potential to be useful when applied to GPR data for the detection of buried\ntargets.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Vinicius Rafael N.
