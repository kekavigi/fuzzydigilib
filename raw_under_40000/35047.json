{"Nomor": 35047, "Judul": "Root microbiome response to treated wastewater irrigation", "Abstrak": "With increasing fresh water (FW) scarcity, the use of treated wastewater (TWW) for crop irrigation is expanding\nglobally. Besides clear benefits, some undesired long-term effects of irrigation with this low quality water on\nplant performance have been reported. As the rhizosphere microbiome can mediate plant-soil interactions, an\nexamination of the response of these organisms to TWW is necessary to understand the full effects of water quality. In the current study, the effects of irrigation water quality on the microbial community structure of soil and\nroots as well as edaphic properties and plant performance were evaluated. We compared soil and roots\nmicrobiomes of two different plant species (tomato and lettuce), each grown in two distinct soils, and irrigated\nwith either FW or TWW. Irrigation with TWW significantly increase soil pH, EC, K, Na and DOC, and decrease\nplant fruit and shoot weight, relatively to samples irrigated with FW. We calculated the effect size of plant species,\nsoil type, and irrigation water quality on microbial community structure in soil and root. In the roots, plant species and irrigation water were the dominant factors in shaping both total (DNA based) and active (RNA based)\nmicrobial communities, with both factors contributing similarly to the observed microbial population. Soil type\nand irrigation water were the dominant factors shaping the total microbial community in the soil and were of\nsimilar magnitude. Irrigation water quality is demonstrated to be a major force in shaping root-associated\nmicrobiome, leading to altered microbial community structure in the critical juncture between plant and soil.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Avihai Zolti [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Stefan J.
