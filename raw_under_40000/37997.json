{"Nomor": 37997, "Judul": "Faces of Tradition in Chinese  Performing Arts", "Abstrak": "The following introduces a special issue of the Journal  of  Folklore Research (55\u20131) examining the roles played by individuals in the development  of  traditional  Chinese  performing  arts  and  how  \u201cfaces of  tradition\u201d  have  come  to  represent  and  reconfigure  broader  fields of cultural production. The authors look at the performance, scholarship, and teaching of instrumental music, folksong, and classical dance, focusing on ways in which CD albums, singing competitions, representative works, and textual anthologies come to serve as discursive spaces where individuals engage with and redefine larger traditions and themselves. Here I, the issue\u2019s guest editor, introduce concerns about representation and individual agency as they relate to studies of the mutual relationship  between  individuals  and  traditions\u2014a  topic  that  has (re)emerged in recent years among the disciplines of ethnomusicology, folklore studies, and dance ethnology. By focusing on specific mechanisms through which multiple individuals have made their marks, the articles in this special issue point to tangible ways in which individuals and traditions interact.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Levi S.
