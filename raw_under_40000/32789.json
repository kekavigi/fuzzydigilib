{"Nomor": 32789, "Judul": "Oil And Gas Processing Products To Obtain Polymers Modified Bitumen", "Abstrak": "To obtain modified bitumen with excellent adhesive properties, coumarone-indene resin (CIR) was used. However, bitumens modified\nby CIR have somewhat worse plastic properties. For the improvement of the plastic properties of road bitumen modified by coumaroneindene resin, the paper proposes to use plasticizers. Characterized by a high content of rings (aromatic-naphthenic oils), a range of compounds was used as plasticizers. Of all different plasticizers tested, the tar produced from West-Ukrainian oils has been found to be the\nmost effective one. The optimal ratio between modified bitumen components was determined enabling to obtain the commercial product\nof polymers modified bitumen of BMP 60/90-52 brand. The complex thermogravimetry and differential-thermal analysis has been used\nto analyze the initial and modified bitumen. Bitumens modified by CIR have shown by far the highest thermal stability under operation\nconditions.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SERHIY PYSHYEV [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Volodymyr Gunka ? , Yuriy Grytsenko, Maria Shved, Victoria Kochubei"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Bitumen; Modifier; Coumarone-indene resin; Plasticizer", "Sumber": "International Journal of Pavement Research and Technology 10 (2017) 289\u2013296. 2017 Chinese Society of Pavement Engineering.
