{"Nomor": 34490, "Judul": "Form and Function: A Matter of Perspective", "Abstrak": "It is often claimed that in product design, product form should follow the intended function of the product. The idea of whether or not \u2018\u2018form follows function\u2019\u2019 is a matter of entrenched views that are often based on anecdotal evidence, and may be industry-specific. We integrate diverse perspectives of design theory and practice by addressing the definitions and relationships between two fundamental components of design: form and function. We consider the primary actors in the product design process as well as the managerially controllable aspects of function and form and the relationship between them, and offer suggestions for future research.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Janell D.
