{"Nomor": 35697, "Judul": "Carbon Nanomaterials for Energy and Biorelated Catalysis: Recent Advances and Looking Forward", "Abstrak": "Along with the wide investigation activities in developing carbon-based,\nmetal-free catalysts to replace precious metal (e.g., Pt) catalysts for various green energy\ndevices, carbon nanomaterials have also shown great potential for biorelated applications.\nThis article provides a focused, critical review on the recent advances in these emerging\nresearch areas. The structure?property relationship and mechanistic understanding of\nrecently developed carbon-based, metal-free catalysts for chemical/biocatalytic reactions\nwill be discussed along with the challenges and perspectives in this exciting field,\nproviding a look forward for the rational design and fabrication of new carbon-based,\nmetal-free catalysts with high activities, remarkable selectivity, and outstanding durability\nfor various energy-related/biocatalytic processes.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Chuangang Hu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jia Qu, Ying Xiao, Shenlong Zhao, Hao Chen, Liming Dai"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Carbon Nanomaterials, Energy, Biorelated Catalysis", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Feb 2019"}
