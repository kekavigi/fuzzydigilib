{"Nomor": 34541, "Judul": "A Soft Computing Approach For Prediction of P- r-T Behavior Of Natural Gas Using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System", "Abstrak": "Density is an important property of natural gas required for the design of gas processing and\nreservoir simulation. Due to expensive measurement of density, industry tends to predict gas\ndensity through an EOS. However, all EOS are associated with uncertainties, especially at highpressure conditions. Also, using sophisticated EOS in commercial software renders simulation\nhighly time-consuming. This work aims to evaluate performance of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference\nsystem (ANFIS) as a widely-accepted intelligent model for prediction of P-r-T behavior of natural\ngas. Using experimental data reported in the literature, our inference system was trained with 95\ndata of natural gas densities in the temperature range of (250e450)K and pressures up to 150 MPa.\nAdditionally, prediction by ANFIS was compared with those of AGA8 and GERG04 which both are\nleading industrial EOS for calculation of natural gas density. It was observed that ANFIS predicts\nnatural gas density with AARD% of 1.704; and is able to estimate gas density as accurate as sophisticated EOS. The proposed model is applicable for predicting gas density in the range of (250\ne450) K, (10e150) MPa and also for sweet gases, i.e., containing a low concentration of N2 and CO2.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Amir Hossein Saeedi Dehaghani  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mohammad Hasan Badizad"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Industrial oils, fats, waxes, gases", "Kata Kunci": "Natural gas, Density ,Fuzzy inference system, Intelligent modeling, Equation of state", "Sumber": "Petroleum, Volume 3, Issue 4, Pages 447-453 (December 2017)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Feb 2019"}
