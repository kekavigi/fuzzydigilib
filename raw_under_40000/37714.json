{"Nomor": 37714, "Judul": "Spectral efficiency of M-QAM in frequency reuse radio systems", "Abstrak": "The spectral efficiency of M-QAM\nmodulation has been investigated for frequency\nreuse radio systems under the propagation conditions\nof the land mobile radio environment. The\nresults indicate that, under certain circumstances\n(of propagation and coverage requirements),\nincreasing the number of levels can lead to an\nimprovement in the spectral efficiency of interference\nlimited systems, but that, as better coverage\nor service quality is sought, these spectral\nefficiency improvements diminish.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "s.w.
