{"Nomor": 37636, "Judul": "Patterning Nanoparticles with DNA Molds", "Abstrak": "We report a nanopatterning strategy in whichself-assembled DNA nanostructures serve as structuraltemplates. In previous work, ordering of NPs primarily reliedon specific recognition, e.g., DNA?DNA hybridization. Onlya few cases have been reported on nonspecific adsorption.Unfortunately, these studies were limited by the integrity andhomogeneity of templates and the variety of patternednanoparticles (NPs). Herein, we have developed a generalmethod to pattern various NPs. The NPs adsorb onto substrate via NP?substrate direct interactions and the substrates arepatterned into large arrays (>4\u00d74?m) of tiny, accessible cavities by self-assembled DNA arrays. As a demonstration, DNAtemplates include tetragonal and hexagonal arrays and the NPs include individual DNA nanomotifs, gold nanoparticles(AuNPs), and proteins. All nanostructures have been confirmed by atomic force microscopy and corresponding fast Fouriertransform (FFT) analysis.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJNRL_PP_Longfei_Liu_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/165140"}, "Penulis": "Longfei Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mengxi Zheng, Zhe Li, Qian Li, and Chengde Mao"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "DNA nanotechnology, DNA nanostructure, self-assembly, blunt-ended stacking, DNA?surface interaction,nanoparticle", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
