{"Nomor": 33633, "Judul": "Therapy for Gastric Cancer with Peritoneal Metastasis Using Injectable Albumin Hydrogel Hybridized with Paclitaxel-Loaded Red Blood Cell Membrane Nanoparticles", "Abstrak": ": The local delivery of therapeutics in a long-term sustained\nmanner at tumor sites is attractive for the therapy of gastric cancer with\nperitoneal metastasis. In this manuscript, an injectable hydrogel-encapsulating\npaclitaxel-loaded red blood cell membrane nanoparticles (PRNP-gel) is\ndesigned on the basis of temperature-induced phase transition of polyethylene-glycol-modified bovine serum albumin (PEG-BSA). Dynamic light\nscattering, ? potential, and electron microscopy were utilized to characterize the\nnanoparticle?hydrogel hybrid system. It was found that the PRNP had a\nspherical morphology with a diameter of about 133 nm and negative surface\npotential. The drug loading efficiency and loading content are 85% and 22%,\nrespectively. In situ gelation occurred within 12 min when the gel precursor was\nincubated at 37 \u00b0C or injected subcutaneously. The in-situ-forming hydrogel\nshowed a sustained release profile, and the cumulative release of PTX was\n?30% after 6 days. The PRNP-gel exhibited high cytocompatibility and\nbiodegradability in vitro and in vivo. This nanoparticle?hydrogel hybrid system is applied as a drug carrier for local\nchemotherapy to enhance therapeutic levels at tumor site and reduce the systemic toxicity. In vivo antitumor evaluation within a\nsubcutaneous xenograft and peritoneal dissemination model showed that the hydrogel possesses good tumor growth\nsuppression properties after a single injection. Hence, the as-prepared injectable hydrogel system could be a promising\ncandidate for the local delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hanqing Qian [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Keyang Qian,.,?
