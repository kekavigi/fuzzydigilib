{"Nomor": 35406, "Judul": "Experimental investigation and damage modeling of salt rock subjected to fatigue loading", "Abstrak": "Damage evolution salt rock under fatigue loading at different stress amplitudes, loading frequencies, and loading\nrates was investigated in the laboratory. Under conditions of fatigue loading, damage of salt rock can be divided\ninto three stages: initial damage, constant-velocity damage, and accelerated damage. The results of the fatigue\ntests indicate that higher stress amplitudes, higher loading frequency, and higher loading rate lead to decreased\nfatigue lifetime. Based on the experiments, a model for the prediction of fatigue life versus stresses, frequency,\nand loading rate was proposed. Comparison between the model and the experimental results shows that fatigue\nlifetime can be estimated and predicted from this model. Based on the three-stage damage trend, the cumulative\nfatigue damage is numerically predicted by considering a double term power damage model. The proposed\nmodel captures the characteristics of damage evolution in salt rock under fatigue loading, with the parameters of\nthe model obtained from experimental data.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mingming He [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ning Li, Caihui Zhu, Yunsheng Chen, Hong Wu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Salt rock, Fatigue model, Damage variable, Cumulative damage, Life prediction", "Sumber": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrmms.2018.12.015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Feb 2019"}
