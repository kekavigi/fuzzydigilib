{"Nomor": 36643, "Judul": "Estimation of pore microstructure by using the static and dynamic moduli", "Abstrak": "The variations of the static and dynamic moduli of porous rocks as a function of differential pressure have been described in terms of pore microstructure, i.e., the\neffects of cracks (soft pores) and intergranular (stiff) pores. Specifically, the first play a major role on the elastic properties of rocks. By using the Mori-Tanaka theory,\nthis work relates rock elastic properties to the pore microstructure. Then, we estimate the distribution of pore aspect ratios by using the static bulk modulus instead of\nthe dynamic one. The approach is applied to data from the Navajo and Weber sandstones. The results show that the cumulative crack porosity and density obtained\nfrom the static bulk modulus are higher than those estimated from the dynamic moduli, while the dominant crack aspect ratio is lower. The total porosity estimated\nfrom the static modulus agrees better with the experimental data. Furthermore, the cumulative crack (soft or compliant) porosity are estimated by the method, which\nalso agrees with results from stress-strain relation and from bulk compressibility curves.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lin Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jing Ba, Liyun Fu, Jos\u00e9 M.
