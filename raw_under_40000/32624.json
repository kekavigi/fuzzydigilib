{"Nomor": 32624, "Judul": "Bioremediation of the soil contaminated with petroleum oil products using sewage sludge", "Abstrak": "The remediation technologies of soils contaminated with petroleum products are developed in\ntwo main directions: the first one encompasses searching for new effective bioagents and the\nother one explores the ways to activate those microorganisms present in the soil that are\ncapable of degrading oil. The objective of this research was to determine if it is possible to\nincrease the effectiveness of biodegradation of petroleum products by using chemical\nadditives. The soil was supplemented with additives: CuSO4, MnSO4, KMnO4, H2O2, 5% and\n10% chemical industry plants sludge, 5% and 10% Stock Company \u2018Klaipedos vanduo\u2019\n(SC\u2018KV\u2019) municipal wastewater treatment plants sludge. The data suggest that all the\nadditives statistically significantly stimulated the degradation of diesel fuel (F = 12.01; p =\n.001) and black oil (F = 9.93; p = .001) compared with the control. It was determined that\ndiesel fuel was degraded the fastest in samples with KMnO4, where efficiency of degradation\nwas 90%, and 88% efficency in samples with 10% chemical industry plants sludge. Black oil\nwas degraded the best in samples, where KMnO4 was added: efficiency of degradation was\nup to 63%. In the samples with 10% of sewage sludge from chemical industry plant\ndegradation efficiency was 62%.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "VIKTORIJA JAKUBAUSKAITEA  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Audrone Zukauskaite", "Zilvinas Kryzevicius", "Dalia Ambrazaitiene", "Monika Vilkiene and Danute Karcauskiene"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Biodegradation; black oil; diesel fuel; microelements; sewage sludge", "Sumber": "Audrone Zukauskaitea , Zilvinas Kryzeviciusa,b, Dalia Ambrazaitienea,b, Monika Vilkienea,b and Danute Karcauskienea,b", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Des 2018"}
