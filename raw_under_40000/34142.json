Program sessions were observed to learn the extent to which picture books\nfeaturing the painting\nA Sunday on La Grande Jatte\n\u2014\n1884\n(Seurat) informed and\nimpacted  children\u2019s  experiences  with  the  original  artwork.  The  books\nKatie\u2019s\nSunday Afternoon\n(Mayhew,\n2005\n),\nBabar\u2019s Museum of Art\n(De Brunhoff,\n2003\n),\nand\nWilly\u2019s  Pictures\n(Browne,\n2000\n) provided  the foundation for  the program. In\naddition to these three books,\nThe Dot\n(Reynolds,\n2003\n), which does not include a\nreference  to\nLa  Grande  Jatte\n(Seurat,\n1884\n\u20131886),  acted  as  a  \u2018\u2018control\u2019\u2019  variable.\nThis research demonstrates that while most picture books can be used to establish a\nlevel  of  comfort  in  an  environment  that  is  new  to  children,  those  that  directly\nreferenced  the  painting  provided  a  base  level  of  knowledge  from  which  children\ncould confidently draw upon encountering the original work. The research further\nindicated that, when used in conjunction with original artworks, children\u2019s art books\nprovide  unique  and  distinct  entry  points  for  talking  about  art.  The  inclusion  of\nartwork  in  children\u2019s  picture  books  elicits  an  enthusiasm  and  recognition  thenhances  the  museum  experience,  and  such  books  can  be  effective  tools  for\nenabling reflective, imaginative experiences with art.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Elizabeth Yohlin [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Picture books  Art history  Intertextuality  Intervisuality  Imagination  Parody  Frame-breaking", "Sumber": "Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Feb 2019"}
