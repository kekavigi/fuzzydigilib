{"Nomor": 33265, "Judul": "Tensor CSAMT and AMT Studies of the Xiarihamu Ni-Cu Sulfide Deposit in Qinghai, China", "Abstrak": "The frequency domain electromagnetic sounding method is one of the important means of exploring mineral resources.\nThis paper combined tensor controlled source audio frequency magnetotelluric (CSAMT) and audio frequency\nmagnetotelluric(AMT) methods to investigate Xiarihamu copper?nickel ore in Qinghai Province. Spliced\ntensor CSAMT high frequency (200 Hz\u20138533 Hz) and AMTlowfrequency (1 Hz\u2013200 Hz) apparent resistivity and\nimpedance phase data, as well as spliced data, were used for a 2D inversion and to generate a 2D geoelectric\nmodel. Coupled with the known geological, geophysical, and drilling data, the inversion results were analyzed.\nThe results show that the combined use of tensor CSAMT and AMT can overcome the inherent defects of these\nmethods, such as limited exploration depth and the \u201cdead band\u201d effect. This method produced good results in\nterms of exploring the underground electrical structure, finding the low resistivity body, and determining the\nthickness of the overburden, aswell as the occurrence and the buried depth of the ore body. These results provide\nan effective method and exploration strategy to find similar potential deposits in the surrounding areas.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Gang Wang  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Da Lei, Zhenyu Zhang, Xiangyun Hud, Yongbo Li, DayongWang, Wei Zhu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Tensor CSAMT AMT 2D inversion Ni-Cu ore", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 159 (2018) 795\u2013802, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.09.031", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Jan 2019"}
