{"Nomor": 34043, "Judul": "Emission And Performance Study Emulsifed Orange Peel Oil Biodiesel In An Aspirated Research Engine", "Abstrak": "This study paves the way on reducing smoke emission and NOx emissions of research diesel engine by detailing the efect\nof water addition in biodiesel. Fuel samples were prepared with diferent concentrations of water in orange peel oil biodiesel (94% waste orange peel oil biodiesel+4% water+2% Span 80 (WOPOBDE1) and 90% waste orange peel oil biodiesel+8% water+2% Span 80 (WOPOBDE2). Span 80 was employed as a nonionic surfactant, which emulsifes water in\nbiodiesel. Experimental results revealed that the nitrogen oxides and smoke emission of orange peel oil biodiesel emulsion\nwere reduced by 11%\u201319% and 3%\u201321%, respectively, compared to that of neat orange peel oil biodiesel (WOPOBD). In\naddition, the introduction of orange peel oil\u2013water emulsions in the diesel engine considerably reduced the emissions of\nunburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. The overall hydrocarbon emission of WOPOBDE2 was 12.2% lower than\nthat of WOPOBD and 16.3% lower than that of diesel. The overall CO emission of WOPOBDE2 was 17% lower than that\nof base fuel (WOPOBD) and 21.8% lower than that of diesel. Experimental results revealed that modifed fuel had higher\nbrake thermal efciency and lower brake specifc fuel consumption than that of base fuel at all engine brake power levels.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "R.
