{"Nomor": 37623, "Judul": "Continuously Enhanced Structural Disorder To Suppress the LatticeThermal Conductivity of ZrNiSn-Based Half-Heusler Alloys byMultielement and Multisite Alloying with Very Low Hf Content", "Abstrak": "ZrNiSn-based half-Heusler (HH) alloys areconsidered very promising thermoelectric (TE) materials atintermediate and high temperatures due to their favorableintrinsic electrical properties, but they are also limited by theirinherent high thermal conductivities. Numerous works havefocused on reducing their thermal conductivities, especially theirlattice thermal conductivities. A multielement (Ti, Hf, Nb, V,and Sb) and multisite alloying strategy for simultaneouslyimproving the electrical properties and greatly reducing thelattice thermal conductivity of ZrNiSn-based HH TE materialsis reported in this work. The continuous enhancement instructural disorder is the main factor in dramatically suppressing the lattice thermal conductivity of the materials. The use ofsuitable dopants also optimizes the electrical properties of the material, which is also an indispensable aspect in achieving highZTvalues. As a consequence, a lowest lattice thermal conductivity?l= 0.99 W/(m K) and a highestZT?1.2 were obtained forZr0.95M0.05Ni1.04Sn0.99Sb0.01(M = Ti0.25Hf0.25V0.25Nb0.25)refined by a ball-milling process. The calculated conversion efficiency(?) of the same sample from room temperature to 873 K was close to 12%. In addition, compared with that used in otherstudies, the amount of Hf used in this study was greatly reduced, which means a reduction in cost. All of thefindings in thisstudy make the commercialization of ZrNiSn-based TE materials more competitive.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Bo_Gong_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/165078"}, "Penulis": "Bo Gong [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yu Li,Fusheng Liu,Jiaxu Zhu,Xiao Wang,Weiqin Ao,Chaohua Zhang,Junqin Li,Heping Xie,and Tiejun Zhu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "half-Heusler alloys, ZrNiSn, thermoelectric, multielement, lattice thermal conductivity", "Sumber": "ACS Appl.
