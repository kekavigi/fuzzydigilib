Virtual environments, in particular, allow fine control over contextual cues present in the environment, which may serve as\ninspiration for creative work. However, using this potential to the fullest requires a detailed understanding of\nhow the environment may influence creative processes. The literature suggests that contextual cues present in\nthe environment may guide the exploration of specific categories of ideas, leading to increased originality; but\nalso that examples of solutions \u2013 which are, undoubtedly, contextual cues themselves \u2013 may lead to reduced\ncreativity through a conformity effect. We successively conducted two experiments in virtual environments. In\nthe first, we manipulated the contents of the environment to prime specific concepts \u2013 water or forest \u2013 and\nexamined the effects on creative output in a divergent thinking task. In the second experiment, we manipulated\nthe nature of the environment and the presence or absence of examples of solutions, and examined the output of\na task involving drawing alien creatures. In both experiments, the contents of environment influenced the nature\nof the creative output by priming specific concepts.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Julien Nelson [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["J\u00e9r\u00f4me Guegan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Creativity Virtual environments Priming Conformity effect", "Sumber": "Computers in Human Behavior 90 (2019) 93\u2013102", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Jan 2019"}
