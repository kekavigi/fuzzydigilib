{"Nomor": 33478, "Judul": "Data kit inversion and uncertainty analysis", "Abstrak": "Linear and nonlinear discrete inverse problems are by genesis ill-posed, that is, several solutions exist compatible\nwith the prior information and fit the observed data within the same error bounds (equivalent models).\nThis fact and the presence of noise and modelling errors cause their solution to be uncertain. Uncertainty analysis\nand solution appraisal is a crucial step in inverse modelling, and it is typically accomplished via random\nsampling methodologies and Bayesian approaches (provided a good knowledge of the probabilistic distributions\nof the model and data spaces is at disposal) or via exploratory global optimization algorithms that\nperform an approximate posterior sampling of the nonlinear equivalence region. This paper demonstrates\nthat a simple method to sample the uncertainty space in linear and nonlinear problems consists in performing\ndifferent inversions of random data bags. This novel methodology is called data kit inversion and it is inspired\nin the bootstrapping technique in statistical inference, switching in this case to the existence of other equivalent\nmodels, instead of using in estimating the properties of a given estimator. We present its application to\ndifferent synthetic linear and nonlinear inverse problems and also to the inversion of a real dataset of gravimetric\ninversion in the Atacama Desert and also to 1D seismic and AVO inversion. We show that using partial\ninformation (random data bags) it is possible to sample different models of the equivalence region (uncertainty\nspace) in order to explore the existence of different plausible geophysical scenarios according to the\ngeophysical model that it is adopted. This algorithm has a general character and can be used in different fields\nof science and technology.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zulima Fern\u00e1ndez-Mu\u00f1iz [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hassan Khaniani, Juan Luis Fern\u00e1ndez-Mart\u00ednez"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Inverse problems Uncertainty analysis Data bagging", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 161 (2019) 228\u2013238, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.12.022", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Jan 2019"}
