{"Nomor": 34534, "Judul": "Impact of alginate selection for wastewater treatment by immobilised Chlorella vulgaris", "Abstrak": "Rapid nutrient removal from municipal wastewater can be achieved by algae immobilised in beads of alginate.\nThe use of immobilised algae has been limited by the additional costs of immobilisation, hence the selection of\nan alginate with appropriate properties can improve its viability. Nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) removal,\nbiomass productivity, bead stability, and production cost were criteria used to compare the immobilisation of\nChlorella vulgaris in three alginate products: food grade, and two laboratory products with low and medium\nviscosity. Algal biomass productivity was greater for low viscosity (47 mg/L/d) than both medium viscosity\n(37 mg/L/d) and food grade (36 mg/L/d) alginate while nutrient removal was independent of alginate product\nin batch culture. As such, the criteria for alginate selection could be narrowed to bead stability and alginate\nprice. Beads prepared from medium viscosity alginate were the least stable as they lost the most strength over\nfour weeks exposure to wastewater, swelled and released more organic carbon than the other two products. This\nwas attributed to the lower proportion of L-guluronate in the polymer for medium viscosity alginate which led to\nthe Ca-alginate having less cross-linking. Greater cross-linking in the structures of the food and low viscosity Caalginates was associated with higher porosity (96.7\u201396.8%) and higher immobilisation efficiency (95\u201397%). As\nimmobilisation in food grade alginate led to similar nutrient removal and little loss of stability in wastewater,\ndespite lower algal growth, its lower cost means it presented as an effective alternative to the laboratory products.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Matthew Kube [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Arash Mohseni.,Linhua Fan.,Felicity Roddick"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Alginate Microalgae Wastewater Biomass production Nutrient recovery", "Sumber": "Chemical Engineering Journal 358 (2019) 1601\u20131609", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Feb 2019"}
