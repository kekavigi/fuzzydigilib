This  paper  explores  the  concept  of  visual  culture  in  Turkey  as  perceived  by  eight  art  teacher  instructors  teaching  at  various  public  \nuniversities\u2019 educational faculties in Turkey. A phenomenological human science approach was employed in order to develop a description of the perception of visual culture, and to predict the possibility of including visual culture studies in pre-service art education in Turkish universities.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Nur Balkir Kuru [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Visual culture; art education; teacher education; art teacher education;  visual culture art education.", "Sumber": "Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences 2 (2010) 609\u2013614", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Apr 2019"}
