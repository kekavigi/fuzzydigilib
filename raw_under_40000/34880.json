{"Nomor": 34880, "Judul": "On The Evaluation Of Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage In Naturally Fractured Oil Reservoirs", "Abstrak": "Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) as a successful enhanced oil recovery (EOR) process has\nbeen applied to extract heavy and extra heavy oils. Huge amount of global heavy oil resources exists\nin carbonate reservoirs which are mostly naturally fractured reservoirs. Unlike clastic reservoirs,\nfew studies were carried out to determine the performance of SAGD in carbonate reservoirs. Even\nthough SAGD is a highly promising technique, several uncertainties and unanswered questions still\nexist and they should be clarified for expansion of SAGD methods to world wide applications\nespecially in naturally fractured reservoirs. In this communication, the effects of some operational\nand reservoir parameters on SAGD processes were investigated in a naturally fractured reservoir\nwith oil wet rock using CMG-STARS thermal simulator. The purpose of this study was to investigate\nthe role of fracture properties including fracture orientation, fracture spacing and fracture\npermeability on the SAGD performance in naturally fractured reservoirs. Moreover, one operational\nparameter was also studied; one new well configuration, staggered well pair was evaluated. Results\nindicated that fracture orientation influences steam expansion and oil production from the horizontal well pairs. It was also found that horizontal fractures have unfavorable effects on oil production, while vertical fractures increase the production rate for the horizontal well. Moreover, an\nincrease in fracture spacing results in more oil production, because in higher fracture spacing\nmodel, steam will have more time to diffuse into matrices and heat up the entire reservoir.\nFurthermore, an increase in fracture permeability results in process enhancement and ultimate\nrecovery improvement. Besides, diagonal change in the location of injection wells (staggered\nmodel) increases the recovery efficiency in long-term production plan", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Seyed Morteza Tohidi Hosseini [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Shayan Esfahani", "Mehran Hashemi Doulatabadi", "Abdolhossein Hemmati Sarapardeh", "Amir H.
