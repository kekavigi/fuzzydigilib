{"Nomor": 36582, "Judul": "Energy Efficiency Strategies for Ecological Greenhouses: Experiences from Murcia (Spain)", "Abstrak": "There has been a continuous growth in ecological agriculture (EA) in recent years. It is\nrecognized as a production system with rational energy use and low demand for fossil fuels. There are\nmany studies relating to this subject, in contrast to the few studies regarding the use of energy and its\nimpact on the environment in ecological greenhouses. This article analyzes the strategies adopted by\na Transformational Agricultural Society (Sociedad Agraria de Transformaci\u00f3n) in order to improve\nenergy efficiency in ecological greenhouses, with regards to the use of fossil fuels. The methodology\nis based on theWorkingWith People (WWP) Model, which involves social learning processes over\n30 years in one of the largest regions of ecological crops in Spain. The results show that the measures\ntaken to manage the greenhouses have achieved a decrease of over 80% in terms of fossil fuel\nconsumption. The experience demonstrates that EA, as opposed to conventional agriculture (CA), is\na system with great potential when it comes to reducing energy consumption and environmental\nimprovements through various strategies.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hilario Becerril [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ignacio de los Rios"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Transformational Agricultural Society; ecological agriculture (EA); conventional agriculture (CA); greenhouses; fossil fuels; renewable energy", "Sumber": "Energies 2016, 9, 866; doi:10.3390/en9110866 www.mdpi.com/journal/energies", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Mar 2019"}
