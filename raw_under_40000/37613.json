{"Nomor": 37613, "Judul": "BER performance analysis of 4-CCL and 5-CcL codes in slotted indoor CDMA systems", "Abstrak": "Abstract: In some applications, such as slotted\nindoor CDMA communications, where the\nnetwork performance depends mainly on periodic\ncrosscorrelation functions of spreading codes,\nminimisation of the peak crosscorrelation level\n(CCL) is not a sufficient measure to ensure an\noptimal performance. The occurrence frequency of\nCCLs is introduced as another important parameter\nto judge CDMA code families. The 4-CCL\nand 5-CCL code families which possess more ideal\nOFs of CCLs than the Gold code are presented. A\nnew technique using a multivariable Bernoulli\nprocess to model the outputs of a CDMA receiver\nis developed to evaluate the network level BER\nperformance in a slotted system. The results\nobtained show that the 4-CCL and 5-CCL codes\nobviously outperform the Gold code in the BER\nperformance.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "X.-H.
