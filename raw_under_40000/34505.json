{"Nomor": 34505, "Judul": "Interactive effects of environmental experience and innovative cognitive style on student creativity in product design", "Abstrak": "Environmental experience can enhance the ideas of design students. Thus, this\ntype of experience may interfere with the influence of design students\u2019 cognitive style on\ncreativity. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of environmental experience\non the relationship between innovative cognitive style and industrial design students\u2019\ncreative outcomes. The environmental experience was measured according to the total\nscores of the five components of sense, feel, think, act, and relate on the basis of Schmitt\u2019s\nstrategic experience modules. The cognitive styles were measured using Kirton\u2019s adap-\ntion\u2013innovation inventory, and creative works were assessed through the consensus\nassessment technique, which was employed by three experts. Through a field experiment\nand survey investigation, the analysis indicated that innovative cognitive style significantly\nand positively influenced creativity, but this only occurred when student was accompanied\nwith a low degree of environmental experience (i.e., a student had a low score for envi-\nronmental experience); as the student attained a high degree of environmental experience,\nthe influence of innovative cognitive style on creativity became weakened. The experi-\nential media suggested that the natural elements, cultural history, group travel, and narrator\neffectively diversified the experiences of the students and enhanced creative thinking. This\npaper suggests providing increased stimulation of environmental experience prior to\ninstructing design students to engage in creative activity. Environmental experience can\nbenefit students by enhancing their creativity.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Chia-Chen Lu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Environmental experience \u00b7 Innovative cognitive style \u00b7 Creativity", "Sumber": "International Journal of Technology & Design Education.
