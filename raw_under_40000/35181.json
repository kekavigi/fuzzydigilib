{"Nomor": 35181, "Judul": "On Effective Graphic Communication of Health Inequality: Considerations for Health Policy Researchers", "Abstrak": "Context: Graphs are an essential tool for communicating health inequality, a key health policy concern. The choice of graphs is often driven by personalpreferences and familiarity. Our article is aimed at health policy researchers developing health inequality graphs for policy and scientific audiences and seeks to (1) raise awareness of the effective use of graphs in communicating health inequality; (2) advocate for a particular type of graph (ie, dot charts) to depict health inequality; and (3) suggest key considerations for the captions accompanying health inequality graphs.\nMethods: Using composite review methods, we selected the prevailing recommendations for improving graphs in scientific reporting. To find the 802 Y. Asada et al.origins of these recommendations, we reviewed the literature on graph perception and then applied what we learned to the context of health inequality. In addition, drawing from the numeracy literature in health risk communication, we examined numeric and verbal formats to explain health inequality graphs.\nFindings: Many disciplines offer commonsense recommendations for visuallypresenting quantitative data. The literature on graph perception, which defines effective graphs as those allowing the easy decoding of visual cues in human brains, shows that with their more accurate and easier-to-decode visual cues, dot charts are more effective than bar charts. Dot charts can flexibly present a large amount of information in limited space. They also can easily accommodate typical health inequality information to describe a health variable (eg, life expectancy) by an inequality domain (eg, income) with domain groups (eg, poor and rich) in a population (eg, Canada) over time periods (eg, 2010\nand 2017). The numeracy literature suggests that a health inequality graph\u2019s caption should provide a numerical, explicitly calculated description of health inequality expressed in absolute and relative terms, from carefully thought-out perspectives. learn from the vibrant multidisciplinary literature how to construct effective graphic communications, especially by considering to use dot charts.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yukiko Asada [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["HANNAH ABEL,  CHRIS SKEDGEL,  and GRACE WARNER"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "health inequality, graphs, communication", "Sumber": "Milbank Quarterly.
