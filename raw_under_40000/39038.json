{"Nomor": 39038, "Judul": "Polymer?Doxorubicin Prodrug with Biocompatibility, pH Response, and Main Chain Breakability Prepared by Catalyst-Free Click Reaction", "Abstrak": "Click chemistry has increasing applications of the\ndevelopment of polymer materials and modification of drug carriers.\nThe amino?yne click polymerization reacts quickly at room temperature\nwithout catalyst, and the enamine bond (-ena-) gained from the reaction\nis sensitive to acid and can be used to prepare stimulus-responsive\npolymeric prodrugs. Herein, we report an alkynyl-terminated polymer\ncontaining alternately distributed low molecular weight polyethylene\nglycol (PEG) and hexamethylenediamino (HMDA) linked by enamine\nbonds, abbreviated as A-P(PEG-alt-HMDA)-A, which was synthesized\nwithin 3 h at 35 \u00b0C without catalyst. The polymer was verified to have\ngood water solubility, biocompatibility, and acid-sensitive fracturing.\nThen, a pH-responsive polymeric prodrug (DOX-ena-PPEG-ena-DOX)\nwas further prepared through the amino?yne click reaction between the\nalkynyl groups of A-P(PEG-alt-HMDA)-A and the amino group of\ndoxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX\u00b7HCl). The resulting prodrug can self-assemble into nanoparticles (NPs) in aqueous solution.\nThe pH responsiveness of the prodrug NPs was demonstrated by a stability experiment of NPs and in vitro drug release\nbehavior measurement. The accumulative release of doxorubicin (DOX) was tested with different pH media, which confirmed\nthat the prodrug NPs could effectively dissociate and release drug under a weak acid microenvironment of lysosome/endosome.\nSubsequently, we investigated cell cytotoxicity and intracellular uptake of the prodrug. It turned out that the prodrug\nnanoparticles could be internalized into HeLa cells, release original DOX, and efficiently inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells.\nThese results show that the pH-responsive DOX-ena-PPEG-ena-DOX has the potential for use in cancer therapy", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Dian Li 1.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170876"}, "Penulis": "Dian Li, [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yue Song, Jinlin He, Mingzu Zhang, Peihong Ni"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "amino?yne click reaction, pH responsiveness, polyethylene glycol, doxorubicin, prodrug", "Sumber": "ACS Biomater.
