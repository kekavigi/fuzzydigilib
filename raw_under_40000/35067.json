The St. Patrick\u2019s Day storm was the first storm of the current solar\ncycle that reached the level \u201cSevere\u201d on the NOAA geomagnetic storm scale. The CME arrived at the Earth about\n04:30 UT on the 17th, the sudden storm commencement (SSC) was recorded at ?04:45 UT followed by a quick\ndrop of the SYM-H index. The Kp planetary index of the geomagnetic activity had reached the maximum value of\n8. The z-component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) was strongly northward at the storm\u2019s day and\naltered to southward direction on the next day. The ionospheric response to that severe geomagnetic storm was\ndetected using processed data from GPS-SCINDA receiver installed at Helwan station (Egypt; Geographic coordinates:\n29.86\u00b0N, 31.32\u00b0E) with a dual frequency (f1=1.5 GHz, f2=1.2 GHz). Our results show that the\nVertical Total Electron Content (VTEC) and the ionospheric scintillation index S4 reached the maximum value on\nthe 17th. The ionospheric features during the storm are described within this study", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ayman M. Mahrous [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Makram Ibrahim, J.
