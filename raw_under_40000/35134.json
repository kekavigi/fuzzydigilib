{"Nomor": 35134, "Judul": "NONEQUILIBRIUM PROPERTIES OF GRAPHENE PROBED BY SUPERCONDUCTING TUNNEL SPECTROSCOPY", "Abstrak": "We report on nonequilibrium properties of graphene probed by superconducting tunnel spectroscopy. A\nhexagonal boron nitride (hBN) tunnel barrier in combination with a superconducting Pb contact is used to\nextract the local energy distribution function of the quasiparticles in graphene samples in different transport regimes. In the cases where the energy distribution function resembles a Fermi-Dirac distribution, the local electron temperature can directly be accessed. This allows us to study the cooling mechanisms of hot electrons in graphene. In the case of long samples (device length L much larger than the electron-phonon scattering length le-ph), cooling through acoustic phonons is dominant.We find a crossover from the dirty limit with a power law T 3 at low temperature to the clean limit at higher temperatures with a power law T 4 and a deformation potential of 13.3 eV. For shorter samples, where L is smaller than le-ph but larger than the electron-electron scattering length le-e, the well-known cooling through electron out-diffusion is found. Interestingly, we find strong indications of an enhanced Lorenz number in graphene. We also find evidence of a non-Fermi-Dirac distribution function, which is a result of noninteracting quasiparticles in very short samples.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SIMON ZIHLMANN [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["P\u00c9TER MAKK,", "SEBASTI\u00c1N CASTILLA,", "J\u00d6RG GRAMICH,", "KISHAN THODKAR,", "SABINA CANEVA,", "RUIZHI WANG,", "STEPHAN HOFMANN,", "AND CHRISTIAN SCH\u00d6NENBERGER"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW B 99, 075419 (2019); \u00a92019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Feb 2019"}
