{"Nomor": 35905, "Judul": "SCHWINGER PAIR PRODUCTION AND STRING BREAKING IN NON-ABELIAN GAUGE THEORYFROM REAL-TIME LATTICE IMPROVED HAMILTONIANS", "Abstrak": "Far-from-equilibrium dynamics of SU\u00f02\u00de gauge theory with Wilson fermions is studied in 1 \u00fe 1 spacetime\ndimensions using a real-time lattice approach. Lattice improved Hamiltonians are shown to be very\nefficient in simulating Schwinger pair creation and emergent phenomena such as plasma oscillations. As a\nconsequence, significantly smaller lattices can be employed to approach continuum physics in the infinitevolume limit as compared to unimproved implementations. This allows us to compute also higher-order correlation functions including four fermion fields, which give unprecedented insights into the real-time\ndynamics of the fragmentation process of strings between fermions and antifermions.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "DANIEL SPITZ AND J\u00dcRGEN BERGES [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW D 99, 036020 (2019); Published by the American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Mar 2019"}
