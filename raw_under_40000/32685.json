{"Nomor": 32685, "Judul": "Bicycle parking security and built environments", "Abstrak": "The lack of secure bicycle parking is a serious but often neglected issue that discourages bicycling. Classical environment criminology theories try to explain the pattern of bicycle theft but\nprovide limited insights into the relationship between crime and the built environment. This\nstudy examines the association between built environment factors and bicycle theft using a zeroinflated negative binomial model to account for data over-dispersion and excess zeros. The assembled dataset provides variables pertaining to the road network, land use, bicycle travel demand, and socio-demographics. The key findings are as follows: (1) Bicycle theft is more likely to\noccur in areas for commercial purposes, areas with a high population or employment density, and\nareas with more bike lanes or sidewalks. (2) Bicycle theft is likely to occur at sites with more bike\nracks or bus stops. (3) Bicycle theft is more likely to occur at mid-blocks than at intersections. (4)\nBicycle theft is more likely to occur in neighborhoods with a greater percentage of socially\ndisadvantaged people and in neighborhoods where residents\u2019 median age is lower. (5) The\nlikelihood of losing a bicycle is lower in areas with more bicycle trips. In general, the number of\nbicycle thefts increases in dense areas with more targets and decreases with greater natural\nguardianship provided by more passersby. With respect to policy implications, governments and\ntransport planners should implement a geographically-differentiated surveillance strategy, encourage bicycling, improve the visibility of bike racks to the public, and promote surveillance and\nnatural guardianship in densely developed areas.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Peng Chena [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Qian Liu.,Feiyang Sun"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Bicycle theft Environment criminology Urban design Built environment Zero-inflated negative binomial model", "Sumber": "Transportation Research Part D 62 (2018) 169\u2013178", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Des 2018"}
