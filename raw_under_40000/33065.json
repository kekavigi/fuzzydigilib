{"Nomor": 33065, "Judul": "Experimental study on moisture migration process of zeolite-based composite humidity control material", "Abstrak": "This paper proposes a new method for the modification of zeolite by microwave-assisted NH4Cl solution,\nand develops a new humidity control material: Zeolite-based humidity composite control material (2#\nZBHCM). Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), FT-IR spectroscopy and N2 adsorption measurement are\nadopted to characterize the microscope pore morphology and spectrum distribution analysis of natural\nzeolite before and after modifications, respectively. In view of the humidity control characteristics of\nthe 2#ZBHCM, the author designs and constructs a humidity control test system, and conducts experimental\nstudy of the humidity control performance of the material and its effect on indoor air temperature\nand relative humidity when applied indoors. The experimental results show that: the 2#ZBHCM has an\nunobvious effect on indoor temperature but a significant impact on indoor humidity; the relative indoor\nair humidity varies in a smaller range if the wall is coated with the 2#ZBHCM on the inside instead of\nordinary plates, offering indoor staff with better thermal comfort.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Bo Zhou [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Juan Shi, Zhen qian Chen"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Zeolite, Composite material,  Moisture migration, Humidity control", "Sumber": "2017 Elsevier Ltd.
