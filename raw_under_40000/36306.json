{"Nomor": 36306, "Judul": "Fast Cationic and Anionic Redox Reactions in Li2RuO3?Li2SO4Positive Electrode Materials", "Abstrak": "For the application of lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) to a large-scalepower source for electric vehicles, positive electrode materials with high energyand power densities should be developed. Although Li-excess materials areregarded as high-capacity positive electrodes, there are several issues in the anionicredox reactions, such as oxygen gas evolution and large resistance, which lead tocapacity fading and limitation of high-current operation. Here, we report the high-current operation of an electrochemical cell using the Li2RuO3?Li2SO4positiveelectrode in LiBs. The cell using Li2Ru0.8S0.2O3.2showed a high capacity of 350mAh g?1with an average discharge voltage of 2.9 V vs Li at 25\u00b0C. By introducingan amorphous matrix based on Li2SO4, a high diffusion coefficient was maintained during the whole charge?discharge process,and low charge-transfer resistance was maintained even at a high oxidation state up to 4.2 V vs Li. As a result, extremely highcurrent operation, such as 40 C rate, was achieved.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Kenji_Nagao_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/162012"}, "Penulis": "Kenji Nagao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Atsushi Sakuda, Wataru Nakamura, Akitoshi Hayashi, Masahiro Tatsumisago"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "lithium-excess positive electrode, amorphous, fast anion redox, high capacity, GITT, charge-transfer reaction", "Sumber": "ACSAppl.EnergyMater.XXXX, XXX, XXX?XXX", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Mar 2019"}
