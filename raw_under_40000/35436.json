{"Nomor": 35436, "Judul": "Highly Crystalline Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube Field Emitters: Energy-Loss-Free High Current Output and Long Durability with High Power", "Abstrak": "Power consumption reduction and energy savings for field-emission (FE) electron sources for the loading of high current output, long durability, and high power are considerably challenging in the field of materials. Here we show a new approach using a simple structure comprising highly crystalline single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in the cathode for meeting these goals of power consumption and energy efficiency....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Norihiro Shimoi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yoshinori Sato, Kazuyuki Tohji"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "single-walled carbon nanotubes, high crystallinity, field-emission electron sources, high current output, long durability", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Feb 2019"}
