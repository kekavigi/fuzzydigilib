{"Nomor": 32393, "Judul": "Control of  a  naturally commutated inverter-fed variable-speed synchronous motor", "Abstrak": "Much interest has been directed towards the use of\nrotationally induced e.m.f.s in the stator windings of an\nexcited-rotor synchronous machine for the natural commutation\nof a directly coupled thyristor inverter to give a\nvariable-speed drive. The attractions of this scheme are that\nrelatively inexpensive power handling devices can be used\nwith a conventional machine to give a drive with inherently\nflexible characteristics.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "N.A.H.
