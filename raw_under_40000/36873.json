{"Nomor": 36873, "Judul": "Wastewater-leachate treatment by microalgae: Biomass, carbohydrate and lipid production", "Abstrak": "Increases in wastewater discharges and the generation of municipal solid wastes have resulted in deleterious\neffects on the environment, causing eutrophication and pollution of water bodies. It is therefore necessary to\ninvestigate sustainable bioremediation alternatives. Wastewater treatment using consortia of microalgae-bacteria\nis an attractive alternative because it allows the removal and recycling of nutrients, with the additional\nadvantage of biomass production and its subsequent conversion into valuable by-products. The present study\naims to integrate wastewater and landfill leachate treatment with the production of microalgal biomass, considering\nnot only its valorization in terms of lipid and carbohydrate content but also the effect of nutrient\nlimitation on biomass formation. The effect of treating a mixture of raw wastewater with different leachate ratios\n(0%, 7%, 10% and 15%) was investigated using a microalgae-bacteria consortium. Two microalgae\n(Desmodesmus spp. and Scenedesmus obliquus) were used. Nutrient removal, biomass concentration, carbohydrate,\nlipid and Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAMEs) content and morphological changes were evaluated. Removals\nof 82% of NH4\n+ and 43% of orthophosphate from a wastewater-leachate mixture (containing 167 mg/L NH4\n+\nand 23 mg/L PO4\n3-) were achieved. The highest final yield was obtained using Desmodesmus spp. (1.95 \u00b1 0.3 g/\nL). The microalgae were observed to accumulate high lipid (20%) and carbohydrate (41%) contents under\nnutrient limiting conditions. The concentration of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs) also increased.\nMorphological changes including the disintegration of coenobia were observed. By using a mixture of wastewater-\nleachate it is possible to remove nutrients, since microalgae tolerate high ammonia concentrations, and\nsimultaneously increase the algal biomass concentration containing precursors to allow biofuel production.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Andrea Hern\u00e1ndez-Garc\u00eda [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sharon B.
