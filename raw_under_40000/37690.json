{"Nomor": 37690, "Judul": "Orthogonal enhanced linear discriminant analysis for face recognition", "Abstrak": "From the intuition that natural face images lie on or near a low-dimensional submanifold, the authors propose a novel spectral graph based dimensionality reduction method, named orthogonal enhanced linear discriminant analysis (OELDA), for face recognition. OELDA is based on enhanced LDA (ELDA), which takes into account both the discriminative structure and geometrical structure of the face space, and generates non-orthogonal basis vectors. However, a significant fact is that eliminating the dependence of basis vectors can promote more effective recognition of unseen face images. For this purpose, the authors seek to improve the ELDA scheme by imposing orthogonal constraints on the basis vectors. Experimental results on real-world face datasets show that, benefitting from orthogonality, OELDA has more locality preserving power and discriminative power than LDA and ELDA, and achieves the highest recognition rates among compared methods.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Chuang Lin [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Binghui Wang, Xin Fan, Yanchun Ma, Huiyun Liu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Mobile Biometrics", "Sumber": "IET Biometrics", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Apr 2019"}
