{"Nomor": 34847, "Judul": "A Prediction Method For The Wax Deposition Rate Based On A Radial Basis Function Neural Network", "Abstrak": "The radial basis function neural network is a popular supervised learning tool based on machinery\nlearning technology. Its high precision having been proven, the radial basis function neural network\nhas been applied in many areas. The accumulation of deposited materials in the pipeline may lead\nto the need for increased pumping power, a decreased flow rate or even to the total blockage of the\nline, with losses of production and capital investment, so research on predicting the wax deposition\nrate is significant for the safe and economical operation of an oil pipeline. This paper adopts the\nradial basis function neural network to predict the wax deposition rate by considering four main\ninfluencing factors, the pipe wall temperature gradient, pipe wall wax crystal solubility coefficient,\npipe wall shear stress and crude oil viscosity, by the gray correlational analysis method. MATLAB\nsoftware is employed to establish the RBF neural network. Compared with the previous literature,\nfavorable consistency exists between the predicted outcomes and the experimental results, with a\nrelative error of 1.5%. It can be concluded that the prediction method of wax deposition rate based\non the RBF neural network is feasible.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ying Xie [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ying Xie, Yu Xing"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Crude oil, Prediction model, Radial basis function neural network, Wax deposition rate", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 3, Issue 2, Pages 237-241 (Juni 2017)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Feb 2019"}
