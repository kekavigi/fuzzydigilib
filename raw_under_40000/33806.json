{"Nomor": 33806, "Judul": "Viscous Fingering And Its Effect On Areal Sweep Efficiency During Waterflooding: An Experimental Study", "Abstrak": "Viscous fingering is one of the main challenges that could reduce areal sweep efficiency during waterflooding in oil\nreservoirs. A series of waterflooding experiments were carried out in a Hele-Shaw cell at ambient temperature during\nwhich areal sweep efficiency was estimated and techniques to ease the fingering problem were examined. The onset and\npropagation of viscous fingers were monitored as a function of both injection rate and injection/production positions. Image\nprocessing techniques were utilized to quantitatively investigate the propagation of fingers. The experimental results show\nthat, under specific conditions, increasing the number of finger branches could improve the areal sweep efficiency, whereas\ngrowth of a single narrow finger has a negative impact on oil displacement efficiency. According to the obtained results,\nincreasing the injection rate improves the areal sweep efficiency up to a critical rate at which viscous fingers start to grow.\nThe impact of heterogeneity of the medium on distributing the viscous fingers was also investigated by introducing two\ndifferent arrangements of fractures in the model. The results show that fractures perpendicular to the direction of flow\nwould distribute the displacing water more uniformly, while fractures in the direction of flow would amplify the unfavorable sweep efficiency.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ZAHRA KARGOZARFARD [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Masoud Riazi", "Shahab Ayatollahi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Viscous fingering, Areal sweep efficiency, Front instability, Mobility ratio, Fractures, Hele-Shaw cell", "Sumber": "Petroleum Science (2019) 16:105\u2013116 https://doi.org/10.1007/s12182-018-0258-6", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Jan 2019"}
