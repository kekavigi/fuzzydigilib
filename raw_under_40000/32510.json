{"Nomor": 32510, "Judul": "Mathematics anxiety and working memory: Longitudinal associations with mathematical performance in Chinese children", "Abstrak": "The link between mathematics anxiety and mathematical performance in young children remains inconclusive.\nThe present study examined the longitudinal associations between mathematics anxiety and\nmathematical performance (calculation and story problem solving) in 246 Chinese children followed\nfrom second to third grade. Multiple regression analyses showed that mathematics anxiety made independent\ncontributions to mathematical performance beyond non-verbal intelligence, working memory,\nnumber skills, general and test anxieties. However, mathematics anxiety does not affect all children\nand all kinds of mathematical performance equally. Mathematics anxiety has a more pronounced impact\non mathematical problems that require more processing resources, as opposed to simple arithmetic\nproblems and straightforward story problems and children who are higher in working memory are more\nvulnerable to its deleterious impacts.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Boby Ho-Hong Ching [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Matematika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Natural sciences & mathematics", "Kata Kunci": "Mathematics anxiety, Working memory, Children", "Sumber": "Contemporary Educational Psychology 51 (2017) 99\u2013113", "Staf Input/Edit": "Dwi Ary Fuziastuti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
