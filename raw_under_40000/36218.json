{"Nomor": 36218, "Judul": "Combining the Advantages of Hollow and One-DimensionalStructures: Balanced Activity and Stability toward MethanolOxidation Based on the Interface of PtCo Nanochains", "Abstrak": "Active and durable electrocatalysts for methanoloxidation reaction (MOR) are of great importance to thepractical application of direct methanol fuel cell technology.Although tremendous efforts have been devoted to optimize theelectrocatalysts, these electrocatalysts still fall far short ofexpectation and suffer from rapid activity loss. Herein, wereport a new strategy for designing PtCo nanochains as amethanol oxidation electrocatalyst with high activity andexcellent stability. The obtained PtCo nanochains consist of astring of hollow spheres that forms a one-dimensional chainstructure. Wefind that having a defect-rich interface betweenadjacent hollow spheres is responsible for high catalyticperformance and stability. With this special morphology, thePtCo nanochains exhibit exceptional activity (3.73 A\u00b7mg?1Pt) and stability (90.8% of initial current retained after 1500 cycles)for methanol oxidation. Thesefindings will provide a new insight in designing and synthesizing high-performanceelectrocatalysts.", "Daftar File": {"2019_EJRNL_PP_Yunwei_Liu_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/161821"}, "Penulis": "Yunwei Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zelin Chen,Chang Liu,Jinfeng Zhang,Xiaopeng Han,Cheng Zhong,Dewei Rao,Yuesheng Wang,Wenbin Hu,Yida Deng"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "methanol oxidation reaction, methanol fuel cell, electrocatalyst, hollow spheres, defect-rich interface", "Sumber": "ACSAppl.EnergyMater.XXXX, XXX, XXX?XXX", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Mar 2019"}
