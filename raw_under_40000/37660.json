{"Nomor": 37660, "Judul": "IF digital generation of FMCW waveforms for wideband channel characterisation", "Abstrak": "Digital generation methods of FMCW\nsignals include frequency synthesis and direct\nwaveform synthesis. The signal can be either generated\ndirectly at IF or from its baseband components\nwhich are combined by a SSB modulator.\nThe IF signal is subsequently upconverted to RF.\nIn this paper the different generation methods at\nIF, and a number of upconversion methods are\ndescribed. A simplified digital technique for combining\nthe baseband components to produce a\nsignal at IF is presented. Application to wideband\ncharacterisation of the mobile radio channel is\nillustrated by a simulation example. Finally, a\ncomparison with PRBS sounders demonstrates\nthe advantages of FMCW sounders which employ\nheterodyne detection.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "S.
