{"Nomor": 37241, "Judul": "The Most Accurate Heuristic-Based Algorithms For Estimating The Oil Formation Volume Factor", "Abstrak": "There are various types of oils in distinct situations, and it is essential to discover a model for\nestimating their oil formation volume factors which are necessary for studying and simulating the\nreservoirs. There are different correlations for estimating this, but most of them have large errors\n(at least in some points) and cannot be tuned for a specific oil. In this paper, using a wide range of\nexperimental data points, an artificial neural network model (ANN) has been created. In which its\ninternal parameters (number of hidden layers, number of neurons of each layer and forward or\nbackward propagation) are optimized by a genetic algorithm to improve the accuracy of the model.\nIn addition, four genetic programming (GP)-based models have been represented to predict the oil\nformation volume factor In these models, the accuracy and the simplicity of each equation are\nsurveyed. As well as, the effect of modifying of the internal parameters of the genetic programming\n(by using some other values for its nodes or changing the tree depth) on the created model. Finally,\nthe ANN and GP models are compared with fifteen other models of the most common previously\nintroduced ones. Results show that the optimized artificial neural network is the most accurate and\ngenetic programming is the most flexible model, which lets the user set its accuracy and simplicity.\nResults also recommend not adding another operator to the basic operators of the genetic\nprogramming", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mohammad Reza Mahdiani [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ghazal Kooti"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Genetic programming, Neural network, Modeling", "Sumber": "Petroleum,vol. 2, Issue 1, Pages 40-4 (March 2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Mar 2019"}
