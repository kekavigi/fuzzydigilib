{"Nomor": 34497, "Judul": "The Interface between  Design and Management", "Abstrak": "The  escalating  complexity  of  contemporary  design  projects  has been the main reason behind the urgent demand for an innovative management  approach  to  designing.  The  actual  complexity  of  a  \ndesign project results from the technical difficulty, the social difficulty, and the uniqueness of design.\nThe technical difficulty is the logical consequence of the combination of different functions, forms, \nstructures, procurement, and financial strategies in large-scale projects. The social difficulty is inevitable because of the involvement of a large number of stakeholders and participants with competing and incommensurable objectives. The uniqueness of design is reflected in the nature of the design problem, the design process employed in its solution, and the design practitioner. Most design problems are ill-defined, interconnecting many factors, and always in dynamic tension with the solutions. The design process is iterative, while the analysis often is done through synthesis. The design practitioners possess a unique competence for simultaneously reconstructing the problems and reframing the solutions. They work in knowledge intensive  organizations  that  cannot  be managed  only  by  laying  down  rules  and  procedures,  which  Mintzberg  calls  \u201coperational  adhocracy.\u201d", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Rizal Sebastian [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "design, management", "Sumber": "Design Issues.
