{"Nomor": 34301, "Judul": "Towards a Dialogic Understanding of Children \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd s Art-Making Process", "Abstrak": "This article is intended to identify the complex process of childre\u2019s art making by bringing new\nmethodologies into the analysis of children\u2019s pictures. This article analyses the art-making process of a selected drawing by a five-year-old boy. The study builds on previous findings regarding children\u2019s verbal discourses during the art-making process in terms of aspects of learning and suggests a possible method of combining two approaches, visual and verbal discourse analyses. In the process of creating one picture, the focal child, Daniel, made a series of drawings that revealed his own interests and included other voices. In doing so, he used the picture as a mediation tool to reflect several children\u2019s\npersonal stands, their interactive process and the larger social discourse.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hyunsu Kim [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "visual methodology, discourse analysis, dialogism, visual utterances, contextual influences", "Sumber": "THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION, 2018", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Feb 2019"}
