{"Nomor": 33816, "Judul": "In Situ Microbial Degradation of PBDEs in Sediments from an E?Waste Site as Revealed by Positive Matrix Factorization and Compound-Specific Stable Carbon Isotope Analysis", "Abstrak": "In the present study, positive matrix factorization (PMF) and compound-specific isotope analysis were used\nto investigate the in situ biodegradation of polybrominated\ndiphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in sediment cores collected from a\npond at an e-waste recycling site in South China. The potential\nmicroorganisms relevant to the degradation of PBDEs were\nalso assessed to aid in the understanding of in situ\nbiodegradation. The PMF results suggested that reductive\ndebromination took place in the sediments. The debromination signal (ratio of the concentration of factor 5 (PMF result)\nto the total PBDE content) was positively correlated with the\nrelative abundance of Dehalococcoidetes at different core\ndepths. The clear 13C enrichment of five PBDE congeners\n(BDE 28, 47, 49, 99, and 153) with increasing core depth\nindicated that a measurable change in isotope fractionation might have occurred during PBDE biodegradation. The in situ\nbiodegradation was further validated by the widespread detection of mono-BDE congeners (BDE 2, BDE 3) and diphenyl ether\nin the sediments. This study provides new evidence to enhance our understanding of the in situ biodegradation of PBDEs and\nsuggests that the extensive removal of bromine from PBDEs was mediated by indigenous microorganisms at the e-waste site.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Chenchen Huang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yanhong Zeng.,Xiaojun Luo.,Zihe Ren., Bin Tang., Qihong Lu.,Shutao Gao., Shanquan Wang.,and Bixian Mai"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "Environmental Science & Technology", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Jan 2019"}
