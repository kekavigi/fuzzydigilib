{"Nomor": 38146, "Judul": "Transport infrastructure and sustainability: a new planning and assessment framework", "Abstrak": "Transport infrastructure is fundamental for economic development and for enabling cities to\nshift away from unsustainable automobile dependence. These agendas are coming together but the tools\nand processes to create less automobile-dependent cities are not well developed. The purpose of this paper\nis to suggest how the planning and assessment process can help to achieve this goal of integration.\nDesign/methodology/approach \u2013 Understanding how cities are shaped by transport priorities\nthrough urban fabric theory creates an approach to the planning and assessment process in transport\nand town planning that can help achieve the purpose.\nFindings \u2013 Four tools are developed from this theory: first, a strategic framework that includes the kind\nof urban fabric that any project is located within; second, benefit cost ratios that include wider economic\nbenefits, especially agglomeration economies in each fabric; third, avoidable costs that assess lost\nopportunities from the kind of urban development facilitated by the infrastructure chosen; and finally,\nvalue capture opportunities that can help finance the infrastructure if they are used to create walking and\ntransit fabric.\nResearch limitations/implications \u2013 Detailed application to the standard transport and town\nplanning tools should now proceed to see how they can be adapted to each urban fabric, not just\nautomobile city fabric.\nPractical implications \u2013 Recognising, respecting and rejuvenating each fabric can be implemented\nimmediately.\nSocial implications \u2013 Urban lifestyle choices are best understood by estimating the potential\ndemand for each market and building to these.\nOriginality/value \u2013 The urban fabric tools outlined provide the best way of integrating sustainable\ndevelopment goals into how cities are planned and transport projects are assessed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Peter William Newman [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Planning, Sustainable development, Cities, Transport, Infrastructure assessment, Urban fabric", "Sumber": "https://search.proquest.com/docview/1712740311/fulltextPDF/25BD81E6B2904723PQ/11?accountid=31562", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Mei 2019"}
