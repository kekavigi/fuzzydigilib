{"Nomor": 32462, "Judul": "Effect of online social networking on student academic performance", "Abstrak": "Online social networks (OSNs) have permeated all generations of Internet users, becoming a prominent\ncommunications tool, particularly in the student community. Thus, academic institutions and faculty are\nincreasingly using social networking sites, such as Facebook and LinkedIn, to connect with current and\npotential students and to deliver instructional content. This has led to a rise in questions about the impact\nof OSN on academic performance and the possibility of using it as an effective teaching tool. To learn\nmore about the impact on academic performance, we conducted a survey of business students at a large\nstate university. Survey results were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results\nrevealed a statistically significant negative relationship between time spent by students on OSN and their\nacademic performance. The time spent on OSN was found to be heavily influenced by the attention span\nof the students. Specifically, we determined that the higher the attention span, the lower is the time spent\non OSN. Further, attention span was found to be highly correlated with characteristics that predict or\ninfluence student behavior, such as their perceptions about society\u2019s view of social networking, their likes\nand dislikes of OSN, ease of use of OSN, etc.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jomon Aliyas Paul [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hope M.
