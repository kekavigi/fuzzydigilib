{"Nomor": 33898, "Judul": "Geophysical Model Functions of Ocean Surface Winds for the Meteor-M No. 2 MTVZA-GY Radiometer", "Abstrak": "The MTVZA-GY microwave radiometer on board the Russian Meteor-M No. 2 meteorological space apparatus is the single instrument scanning the Earth under the incidence angle of 65\u00b0. The geophysical model function (GMF) relating the MTVZA-GY brightness temperatures TB(v) to the sea surface wind speed at the frequencies v between 10 and 36 GHz was derived by the joint analysis of the TB(v), the scatterometer and ERA5 reanalysis data. The reanalysis data were used to found the total cloud absorption and atmospheric contributions to the measured TB(s) and compute the brightness temperature of the ocean surface under various wind speeds. The collocated database included also the GCOM-W1 AMSR2 TB(v) and was obtained for winter deep cyclones in the Northern Pacific Ocean.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mitnik L.
