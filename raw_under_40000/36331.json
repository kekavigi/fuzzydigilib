{"Nomor": 36331, "Judul": "Evaluation Of Gas Condensate Reservoir Behavior Using Velocity Dependent Relative Permeability During The Numerical Well Test Analysis", "Abstrak": "Gas condensate is one of the most different fluids in reservoir simulation due to retrograde\ncondensation in case of pressure reduction. In this kind of fluids, two phenomena named negative\ninertia and positive coupling, become significant in the high velocity zone around the wellbore. In\nthis study, a modified black oil simulator is developed that take into account the velocity dependent\nrelative permeability. Against the industrial simulator that assumes linear variation of transmissibilities by pressure, modified black oil nonlinear equations are solved directly without linearization. The developed code is validated by ECLIPSE simulator. The behavior of two real gas\ncondensate fluids, a lean and a rich one, are compared with each other. For each fluid, simulations\nof PVT experiments are carried out to calculate black oil property applying Coats approach for gas\ncondensate fluids. For both fluids, the proposed models for gas condensate velocity dependent\nrelative permeability show different influence of velocity on relative permeability in the same\nconditions. Moreover, it is observed that higher flow rate of gas production leads to more\ncondensate production during constant rate well testing", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Arash Azamifard  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mahnaz Hekmatzadeh", "Bahram Dabir"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Gas condensate, Velocity dependent relative permeability, Modified black oil simulation, Numerical well testing", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 2, Pages 156-165 (June  2016)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Mar 2019"}
