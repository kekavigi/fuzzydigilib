{"Nomor": 38125, "Judul": "Numerical Analysis On The Crack Propagation And Failure Characteristics Of Rocks With Double Fissures Under The Uniaxial Compression", "Abstrak": "The fissures and rock bridges with different dips had different contributions to crack's initiation,\npropagation, convergence and penetration. In this paper, based on the rock fracture theory, the\ncrack's propagation and evolution process on rock specimen with double fissures under uniaxial\ncompression was simulated. As a result, the crack propagation and evolution law of rocks with\ndifferent fissure dips (a \u00bc 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90; b \u00bc 45) and different rock bridge dips\n(b \u00bc 0, 30, 45, 60, 90; a \u00bc 45) was obtained by numerical tests. Meanwhile, the fissure and\nrock bridge dips influence on the macro mechanical properties of rock was analyzed. Besides, the\npaper investigated the influences of different fissure dips and different rock bridge dips on the\nbridge transfixion. The study is of great significance to reveal the impact of different dips on the\nmechanical mechanism of multiple-fissures rock under specific conditions, and it also has important theoretical significance for the research on multiple-fissure rock.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "LEYONG CHEN  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jianjun Liu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Double fissures rock, Numerical calculation, Fissure dip, Dip of rock bridge, Fracture theory", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Mei 2019"}
