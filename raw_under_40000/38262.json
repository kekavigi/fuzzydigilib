{"Nomor": 38262, "Judul": "CULTURAL STUDIES AND LATIN AMERICANISM: INTELLECTUALS, CULTURE AND IDEOLOGY", "Abstrak": "An interview with cultural studies scholar Santiago Castro-G\u00f3mez is presented. He opines that Cultural Studies did not exist in Latin America before the 1980s. Castro-G\u00f3mez explains that he considers \"Latin America\" to be a signifier that needs to be investigated, rather than a definite place. He also discusses the relationship that he perceives between \"social imaginaries\" and global capitalism.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jeffrey Cedeno  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Maite Villoria Nolla"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "semiotic, capitalism, cultural studies", "Sumber": "Cultural Studies Vol. 26, No. 1 January 2012, pp. 62-70", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Mei 2019"}
