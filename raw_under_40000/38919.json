{"Nomor": 38919, "Judul": "Selective Metallization Induced by Laser Activation: Fabricating Metallized Patterns on Polymer via Metal Oxide Composite", "Abstrak": "Recently, metallization on polymer substrates has been given\nmore attention due to its outstanding properties of both plastics and metals. In\nthis study, the metal oxide composite of copper?chromium oxide (CuO\u00b7\nCr2O3) was incorporated into the polymer matrix to design a good laser direct\nstructuring (LDS) material, and the well-defined copper pattern (thickness\n=10 ?m) was successfully fabricated through selective metallization based on\n1064 nm near-infrared pulsed laser activation and electroless copper plating.\nWe also prepared polymer composites incorporated with CuO and Cr2O3;\nhowever, these two polymer composites both had very poor capacity of\nselective metallization, which has no practical value for LDS technology. In our\nwork, the key reasons causing the above results were systematically studied\nand elucidated using XPS, UV?vis?IR, optical microscopy, SEM, contact\nangle, ATR FTIR, and so on. The results showed that 54.0% Cu2+ in the\npolymer composite of CuO\u00b7Cr2O3 (the amount =5 wt %) is reduced to Cu0\n(elemental copper) after laser activation (irradiation); however, this value is only 26.8% for the polymer composite of CuO (the\namount =5 wt %). It was confirmed that to achieve a successful selective metallization after laser activation, not only was the new\nformed Cu0 (the catalytic seeds) the crucial factor, but the number of generated Cu0 catalytic seeds was also important. These\ntwo factors codetermined the final results of the selective metallization. The CuO\u00b7Cr2O3 is very suitable for applications of\nfabricating metallic patterns (e.g., metal decoration, circuit) on the inherent pure black or bright black polymer materials via LDS\ntechnology, which has a prospect of large-scale industrial applications.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Jihai Zhang 1.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/170645"}, "Penulis": "Jihai Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Tao Zhou,  Liang Wen"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "metallization, laser direct structuring, polymer, metal oxide, NIR pulsed laser", "Sumber": "www.acsami.org  DOI: 10.1021/acsami.6b15828 ACS Appl.
