{"Nomor": 38443, "Judul": "Self-Supplied Nano-Fusing and Transferring Metal Nanostructures via Surface Oxide Reduction", "Abstrak": "Here, we demonstrate that chemical reduction of oxide layers\non metal nanostructures fuses junctions at nanoscale to improve the optoelectrical performance, and to ensure environmental stability of the\ninterconnected nanonetwork. In addition, the reducing reaction lowers the\nadhesion force between metal nanostructures and substrates, facilitating the\ndetachment of them from substrates. Detached metal nanonetworks can be\neasily floated on water and transferred onto various substrates including\nhydrophobic, floppy, and curved surfaces. Utilizing the detached metal\nnanostructures, semitransparent organic photovoltaics is fabricated, presenting\nthe applicability of proposed reduction treatment in the device applications.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP Jaeho Ahn 1.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/169721"}, "Penulis": "Jaeho Ahn [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ji-Won Seo,Jong Yun Kim,Jaemin Lee,Changsoon Cho,Juhoon Kang, Sung-Yool Choi, Jung-Yong Lee"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "metal nanowire, junction fusing, reduction reaction, improved stability, transfer process, semitransparent organic photovoltaics", "Sumber": "www.acsami.org", "Staf Input/Edit": "Latifa Noor", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Mei 2019"}
