{"Nomor": 33362, "Judul": "Methods for sampling and detection of microplastics in water and sediment: A critical review", "Abstrak": "Microplastics are widespread contaminants, virtually present in all environmental compartments.\nHowever, knowledge on sources, fate and environmental concentration over time and space still is\nlimited due to the laborious and varied analytical procedures currently used. In this work we critically\nreview the methods currently used for sampling and detection of microplastics, identifying flaws in\nstudy design and suggesting promising alternatives. This work provides insights on bulk sample\ncollection, separation, digestion, identification and quantification, and mitigation of cross-contamination.\nThe sampling of microplastics will improve in representativeness and reproducibility through the\ndetermination of bulk sample volume, filter's pore size, density separation and digestion solutions, but\nalso through use of novel methods, such as the enhancement of visual identification by staining dyes, and\nthe generalized use of chemical characterization.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Joana Correia Prata [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Joao P. da Costa.,Armando C.
