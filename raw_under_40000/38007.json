{"Nomor": 38007, "Judul": "Density Wave Probes Cuprate Quantum Phase Transition", "Abstrak": "In cuprates, the strong correlations in proximity to the antiferromagnetic Mott insulating state give rise to\nan array of unconventional phenomena beyond high-temperature superconductivity. Developing a\ncomplete description of the ground-state evolution is crucial to decoding the complex phase diagram.\nHere we use the structure of broken translational symmetry, namely, d-form factor charge modulations in\n\u00f0Bi; Pb\u00de 2 \u00f0Sr; La\u00de 2CuO6\u00fe? as a probe of the ground-state reorganization that occurs at the transition from truncated Fermi arcs to a large Fermi surface. We use real space imaging of nanoscale electronic\ninhomogeneity as a tool to access a range of dopings within each sample, and we definitively validate the\nspectral gap ? as a proxy for local hole doping. From the ? dependence of the charge modulation\nwave vector, we discover a commensurate-to-incommensurate transition that is coincident with the Fermisurface transition from arcs to large hole pocket, demonstrating the qualitatively distinct nature of the electronic correlations governing the two sides of this quantum phase transition. Furthermore, the doping dependence of the incommensurate wave vector on the overdoped side is at odds with a simple Fermisurface-driven instability.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Tatiana A.
