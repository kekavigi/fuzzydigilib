What meanings do actors associate with the label? What intentions might be driving the word\u2019s use and/or manipulation? And what implications might the existence of multiple interpretations have for the persons under discussion and the processes within which they sit? Though this is evidently important in popular accounts, where the term\u2019s misuse fuels anti-immigration sentiments and societal mistrust, the ramifications of these multiple interpretations for assisting refugees and negotiating durable solutions have lacked critical exploration. Existing approaches to\nunderstanding the politics of the refugee regime have tended to focus on physical sites of contestation, such as refugee camps. This article re-introduces semiotics as a heuristic framework through which to understand how the word\u2018refugee\u2019 in itself constitutes a disputed arena, and to explore what impacts this has on negotiations over their future. This approach is used to explain the controversial negotiations surrounding the invocation of the Cessation Clause for Rwandan refugees in Uganda. Extensive resistance to the cancellation of Rwandan refugees\u2019 statuses has not been met by commensurate attempts to explain when, why and how this process unfolded.Through conceptualising\u2018refugee\u2019 as a sign according to the Saussurean and Barthean models of semiotics, this piece charts the multiple meanings that this label signified alongside its established legal-normative definition, anddiscusses what implications this had for how durable solutions were negotiated. Disaggregating the label provides a route through which to explore what enables the conceptual and spatial dissonance that plagues certain attemptsto conclude protracted refugee situations. The piece concludes by discussing the analytical possibilities that emerge from re-engaging with socio-semiotic approaches, including through proposing greater engagement with\nthe political geographies of words and their meanings.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "George Cole [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "refugees; semiotics; Rwanda; Uganda; cessation clause; political geographies of words", "Sumber": "Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers.
