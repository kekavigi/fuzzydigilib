{"Nomor": 33157, "Judul": "Interactions between microplastics and phthalate esters as affected by microplastics characteristics and solution chemistry", "Abstrak": "Microplastics have become a major concern in recent years as they can be recognized as the transport\nvectors for pollutants in environment. In this study, the sorption behavior of two phthalate esters (PAEs),\nincluding diethyl phthalate (DEP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP), onto three types of microplastics (PVC:\npolyvinyl chloride, PE: polyethylene, and PS: polystyrene) was investigated. The sorption isotherms of\nboth DEP and DBP on microplastics were highly linear, suggesting that the partition was the main\nsorption mechanism. The Kd values of DBP were much higher than those of DEP, demonstrating that\nhydrophobic interaction governed the partition mechanism. Sorption of the two PAEs on the three\nmicroplastics followed the order of PS > PE > PVC, indicating that chemical properties of microplastics\nplayed an important roles in their sorption behaviors. Solution pH and natural organic matter had no\nsignificant impact on PAEs sorption by microplastics. However, the presence of NaCl and CaCl2 enhanced\nthe sorption of both DEP and DBP because of the salting-out effect. The findings of the present study may\nhave significant implications for the fate and transport assessment of both PAEs and microplastics.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Fei-fei Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": [", Guang-zhou Liu., Zhi-lin Zhu.,Su-chun Wang., Fei-fei Zhao"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Microplastics Phthalate esters Sorption Polyvinyl chloride Polyethylene Polystyrene", "Sumber": "Chemosphere 214 (2019) 688-694", "Staf Input/Edit": "Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi \u00a0\n                                     Lili Sawaludin Mulyadi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "16 Jan 2019"}
