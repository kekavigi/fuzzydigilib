{"Nomor": 32655, "Judul": "Chemotaxis of Biofilm Producing Pseudomonas spp. towards Refined Petroleum Oil", "Abstrak": "The bioavailability of organic contaminants to the degrading bacteria is a major\nlimitation to efficient bioremediation of sites contaminated with hydrophobic pollutants.\nStudies were conducted to analyze the presence of biodegrading bacteria on the sites of\nrefinery and garage oil spills with abundance of hydrocarbons. Contaminated soils were\ncollected from these rich hydrocarbon sites and bacteria were isolated from samples\nusing regular bacterial media enriched with petroleum oil. These isolates were\ncharacterized for their efficiency to utilize refining petroleum oil as their energy source\nand then the most common isolate was characterized. Further investigations examine the\nformation of biofilm by naturally existing oil-degrading bacteria on refine petroleum oil\ndegradation. Here also studied the abilities of these Pseudomonas strains to respond\nchemo tactically to refine petroleum oil. Microbial chemotaxis plays important role for\nformation of biofilm. 16S rDNA analysis of the best degrader was found to belong to\nthe Pseudomonas species. Interestingly, one of the best isolates was found to be close to\nPseudomonas aeruginosa family", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "S. DUTTA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["P.
