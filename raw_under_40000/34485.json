{"Nomor": 34485, "Judul": "LOW-ENERGY ELECTRON-MODE COUPLINGS IN THE SURFACE BANDS OF SR2RUO4REVEALED BY LASER-BASED ANGLE-RESOLVED PHOTOEMISSION SPECTROSCOPY", "Abstrak": "We use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with a 7-eV laser, which is capable of ultrahigh energy and momentum resolutions, and investigate bosonic mode couplings in the surface bands of Sr2RuO4. Significantly, our measurements reveal pronounced kink structures at very low binding energies (?8 and ?15 meV), which have a strong variation in the renormalization strength among multiple bands derived from the Ru 4d orbitals. Neutron scattering has observed phonon modes with the lowest energy scale around 15 meV, which thus could be the main source for the ?15-meV kink. In contrast, the significant coupling at the lower energy (?8 meV) is attributed to magnetic excitations, which are reported to be peaked in density of states around 10 meV. The ?8-meV kink is found to be strongest in the two-dimensional 4dxy-derived band, implying its mechanism to be the electron coupling to ferromagnetic spin fluctuations.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SHUNTARO AKEBI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["TAKESHI KONDO,", "MITSUHIRO NAKAYAMA,", "KENTA KURODA,", "SO KUNISADA,", "HARUKA TANIGUCHI,", "YOSHITERU MAENO,", "AND SHIK SHIN"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW B 99, 081108(R) (2019); \u00a92019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Feb 2019"}
