{"Nomor": 37611, "Judul": "Slotted ALOHA land-mobile radio networks with site diversity", "Abstrak": "An analytical method for investigating\nslotted ALOHA land-mobile networks is presented.\nThe probability of successful reception and\nthroughput is assessed for a single base station,\ntaking account of contending transmissions and\nreceiver noise. Receiver capture is assumed to\noccur if the received signal power exceeds the joint\ninterference power by a certain margin, called the\nreceiver threshold. Rayleigh fading and UHF\ngroundwave propagation are considered. Results\nare extended for a cellular network considering\nthe interference from packet transmissions in\nother (co-channel) cells. It is seen that in packetswitched\ncellular nets, frequency re-use distances\nmay be substantially smaller than in circuitswitched\n(CW) telephony networks, where each\ncell has to be safeguarded continuously from cochannel\ninterference. Moreover, a technique to\nassess the throughput of ALOHA networks with\nmultiple, geographically-separated base stations is\npresented and numerical results are given for\nuniform Poisson-distributed packet transmissions\nin the service area.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "J.-P.M.G.
