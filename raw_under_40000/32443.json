{"Nomor": 32443, "Judul": "Tools for Measuring Construction Materials Management Practices and Predicting Labor Productivity in Multistory Building Projects", "Abstrak": "Planning, monitoring, and evaluating materials management practices are important for enhancing construction productivity. This\nstudy is designed to develop a tool for scoring materials management practices for building projects and, on that basis, build a tool for\npredicting productivity. The research was carried out in two phases. During Phase I, in-depth interviews were conducted with 19 experts\nand context-specific materials management practices were identified. During Phase II, questionnaires were used to collect quantitative data\nfrom 39 contractors. To prioritize the practices that were identified during Phase I, the quantitative data were analyzed. Based on the analysis,\ntools for measuring and planning the materials management practices and probability-based regression models were developed. Procurement\nplans for materials, long-lead materials identification, and materials delivery schedule are the three most significant practices. Contractors can\nuse the scoring tool to measure the levels of implementation of the practices and assess the risk of having low productivity using the predictive\nmodels. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by developing construction materials management practices measuring, planning,\nmonitoring, and evaluating tools in the context of building projects. In addition, the logistic and linear regression models can be used to assess\nwhether a certain level of implementation of the construction materials management practice might be associated with higher or lower labor\nproductivity.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Argaw Tarekegn Gurmu, Ph.D. [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Labor productivity; Building construction projects; Materials management practices; Regression models. Introduction The construction industry makes a substantial contribution to the growth of an economy of a country. In 2015, the construction industry of Australia comprised about 8.29% of the gross value added (ABS 2016). However, the labor productivity growth in the construction industry is low as compared with other sectors. The Australian Productivity Commission (2015) report showed that the growth in labor productivity of the total economy in 2013/2014 was 1.4%. However, the construction industry\u2019s labor productivity was ?1.0%. According to the Australian Productivity Commission (2013), labor productivity can be measured as an output per unit of labor input in hours worked. In this research, the output is the value of the completed building project (in AUD) and input is the project duration in days. Furthermore, labor productivity and productivity are used interchangeably, and multistory buildings refer to buildings having a rise in the story more than three. A study conducted by the Australian Productivity Commission (2013) recommended that change in the management practices and the implementation of advanced technology can enhance productivity. Nonetheless, Rojas and Aramvareekul (2003) found that the adoption of the new technology could be useful but not adequate to improve productivity. The author suggested that management practice plays a vital role. Thus, this study focuses on the materials management practices", "Sumber": "J. Constr. Eng.
