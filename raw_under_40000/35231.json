{"Nomor": 35231, "Judul": "GENERALIZED RECIPROCITY RELATIONS IN SOLAR CELLS WITH VOLTAGE-DEPENDENT CARRIERCOLLECTION: APPLICATION TOP-I-NJUNCTION DEVICES", "Abstrak": "Two reciprocity theorems are important for fundamental understanding of the solar cell operation and\napplications to device evaluation: (1) the carrier-transport reciprocity connecting the dark-carrier injection\nwith the short-circuit photocarrier collection and (2) the optoelectronic reciprocity connecting the electroluminescence with the photovoltaic quantum efficiency at short circuit. These theorems, however, fail in devices with thick depletion regions such as p-i-n junction solar cells. By properly linearizing the carriertransport equation in such devices, we report that the dark-carrier injection is related to the photocarrier collection efficiency at the operating voltage, not at short circuit as suggested in the original theorem. This leads to the general form of the optoelectronic reciprocity relation connecting the electroluminescence with the voltage-dependent quantum efficiency, providing a correct interpretation of the optoelectronic properties of p-i-n junction devices. We also discuss the validity of the well-known relation between the open-circuit voltage and the external luminescence efficiency. The impact of illumination intensity and device parameters on the validity of the reciprocity theorems is quantitatively investigated.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "KASIDIT TOPRASERTPONG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["AMAURY DELAMARRE,", "YOSHIAKI NAKANO,", "JEAN-FRAN\u00c7OIS GUILLEMOLES,", "ANDMASAKAZU SUGIYAMA"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED 11, 024040 (2019); \u00a9 2019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari \u00a0\n                                     Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Feb 2019"}
