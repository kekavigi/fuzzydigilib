{"Nomor": 32904, "Judul": "Multicomponent prestack joint AVO inversion based on exact Zoeppritz equation", "Abstrak": "The Zoeppritz equation describes the relationship between reflection and transmission coefficients, incidence angles\nand elastic properties. Currently, most of the prestack joint AVO or AVA (amplitude variation with offset or\nangle) inversion methods are based on various approximations of the exact Zoeppritz equation. However, because\nthese approximations have certain assumptions and limitations, such as limited incident angles or weak\ncontrast of elastic parameters on either side of the interface, the conventional linear prestack joint AVO inversion\nbased on different approximations isn't suitable, which reduces the inversion accuracy theoretically. In this\npaper, we develop a multi-objective prestack joint AVO inversion method using both PP and PS seismic data\nbased on the exact Zoeppritz equation. To solve the nonlinear multi-objective inversion problems, we use a developed\nfast nondominated sorting genetic algorithm(NSGA II) to estimate three elastic parameters, including Pwave\nvelocity, S-wave velocity and density. Compared with the conventional weighted stacking optimization\nmeans of objective functions, this approach is robust because it can simultaneously cope with more than one objective\nfunctionwithout introducingweight coefficients.Model tests illustrate that the nonlinearmulti-objective\nprestack joint AVO inversion method shows great potential to estimate three elastic parameters with the exact\nZoeppritz equation. We also analyze the influence of the initial model and the search window on the inversion\nresults. Additionally, the seismic data with random noise examples reveal the stability and anti-noise interference\nability of our joint AVO inversion method.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Wei Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yanchun Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Exact Zoeppritz equation Multicomponent Multi-objective Prestack joint AVO inversion Fast nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA II)", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 159 (2018) 69\u201382, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.07.017", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Jan 2019"}
