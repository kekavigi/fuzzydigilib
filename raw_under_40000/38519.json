{"Nomor": 38519, "Judul": "EFFECTS OF ATTRIBUTIONS AND SOCIAL MEDIA  EXPOSURE ON OBESITY STIGMA AMONG KOREAN  ADOLESCENTS", "Abstrak": "We explored how, and to what extent, social media exposure to body image content affected \nthe  obesity  stigma,  in  relation  to  adolescents\u2019  internal  and  external  attributions.  Participants  \nwere 202 high school students in South Korea who completed an online survey. The results \nconfirmed  the  main  effect  of  internal  attributions  in  which  those  adolescents  who  blamed  \nindividuals for being obese demonstrated high levels of obesity stigma, indicating a need to \ncommunicate with adolescents regarding the causes of being overweight or obese. No main \neffects of external attributions and social media exposure were found. However, the interaction \neffect  between  external  attributions  and  social  media  exposure  was  significant.  This  means  \nthat  body  image  content  emphasizing  thinness  and  physical  attractiveness  on  social  media  \nmay  have  strengthened  the  obesity  stigmatization  through  external  attributions.  The  results  \nof this study offer a useful direction for addressing the obesity stigma for adolescents in the \nrapidly evolving communication landscape.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "YUJIN  LIM  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["SOONTAE  AN"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "obesity stigma, attributions, social media exposure, materialism.", "Sumber": "SOCIAL BEHAVIOR AND PERSONALITY, 2018,  46 (12), 2049\u20132062", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Mei 2019"}
