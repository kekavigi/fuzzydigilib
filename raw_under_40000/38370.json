{"Nomor": 38370, "Judul": "Teaching Visual Rhetoric as a Close Reading Strategy", "Abstrak": "In FYW, instructors want students to understand how reading texts in particular  ways  affects  how  and  what  they  learn  and,  in  turn,  how  and  what  they  might  communicate  to  their  own  readers.  Because  students  tend  to  come  to  FYW  predisposed  to  notice  more  visual  aspects  (e.g.,  headings,  bulleted lists) than verbal aspects (e.g., verbal subordinators, cohesive ties) of  texts,  instructors  are  challenged  to  generate  among  students  conscious  awareness  of  their  reading  practices,  including  awareness  of  the  kinds  of  practices called for by different reading situations. This article explores how visual rhetoric taught as a close reading strategy can help diverse groups of \nstudents become more adaptable readers of the visual continuum of texts. The performance-oriented genre of the assignment prompt is offered as an example that makes visible what students may not notice in a text. I argue that  introducing  students  to  the  core  principles  of  visual  rhetoric  is  one  \nproductive way to help students read non-visual texts in more visual ways. Students who understand how visual and verbal cues exert rhetorical control will be more empowered readers of others\u2019 texts and designers of their own texts, in FYW and beyond.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Rebekka Andersen [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "visual rethoric, reading strategy, teacher attitude", "Sumber": "Composition Studies Fall2016, Vol. 44 Issue 2, p15-38. 24p. 2016", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Mei 2019"}
