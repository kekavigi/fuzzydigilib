{"Nomor": 35407, "Judul": "Drained pore modulus and Biot coefficient from pore-scale digital rock simulations", "Abstrak": "We present a digital rock workflow to determine poroelastic parameters which are difficult to extract from welllog or laboratory measurements. The drained pore modulus is determinant in the compaction problem. This\nmodulus represents the ratio of pore volume change to confining pressure when the fluid pressure is constant. In\nlaboratory experiments, bulk volume changes are accurately measured by sensors attached to the outer surface\nof the rock sample. In contrast, pore volume changes are notoriously difficult to measure because these changes\nneed to quantify the pore boundary deformation. Hence, accurate measures of the drained pore modulus are\nchallenging. We simulate static deformation experiments at the pore-scale utilizing a digital rock image. We\nmodel an Ottawa F-42 sand pack obtained from an X-ray micro-tomographic image. This image is segmented\ninto a network of grains and pore space. The network of grains is taken as an elastic, isotropic and homogeneous\ncontinuum. We then compute the linear momentum balance for the network of grains. We calculate the change\nin pore volume using a post-processing algorithm, which allows us to compute the local changes in pore volume\ndue to the applied load. This process yields an accurate drained pore modulus. We then use an alternative\nestimate of the drained pore modulus. We exploit its relation to the drained bulk modulus and the solid phase\nbulk modulus (i.e., Biot coefficient) using the digital rock work- flow. Finally, we compare the drained pore\nmodulus values obtained from these two independent analyses and find reasonable agreement.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Shakil Ahmed [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Tobias M.
