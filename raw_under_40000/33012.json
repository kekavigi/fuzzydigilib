{"Nomor": 33012, "Judul": "Development Of New Correlations For The Oil Formation Volume Factor In Oil Reservoirs Using Artificial Intelligent White Box Technique", "Abstrak": "Oil formation volume factor (OFVF) is considered one of the main parameters required to characterize the\ncrude oil. OFVF is needed in reservoir simulation and prediction of the oil reservoir performance. Existing\ncorrelations apply for specific oils and cannot be extended to other oil types. In addition, big errors were\nobtained when we applied existing correlations to predict the OFVF. There is a massive need to have a\nglobal OFVF correlation that can be used for different oils with less error.\nThe objective of this paper is to develop a new empirical correlation for oil formation volume factor\n(OFVF) prediction using artificial intelligent techniques (AI) such as; artificial neural network (ANN),\nadaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and support vector machine (SVM). For the first time we\nchanged the ANN model to a white box by extracting the weights and the biases from AI models and\nform a new empirical equation for OFVF prediction. In this paper we present a new empirical correlation\nextracted from ANN based on 760 experimental data points for different oils with different compositions.\nThe results obtained showed that the ANN model yielded the highest correlation coefficient (0.997)\nand lowest average absolute error (less than 1%) for OFVF prediction as a function of the specific gravity\nof gas, the dissolved gas to oil ratio, the oil specific gravity, and the temperature of the reservoir\ncompared with ANFIS and SVM. The developed empirical equation from the ANN model outperformed\nthe previous empirical correlations and AI models for OFVF prediction. It can be used to predict the OFVF\nwith a high accuracy", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SALAHELDIN ELKATATNY [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mohamed Mahmoud"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Oil formation volume factor, Artificial intelligent, Reservoir management, Artificial neural network", "Sumber": "Petroleum 4 (2018) 178e186 - KeAi, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2017.09.009", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Jan 2019"}
