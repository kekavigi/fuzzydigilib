{"Nomor": 38400, "Judul": "How to Construct a Mixed Methods Research Design", "Abstrak": "This article provides researchers with knowledge of how to design a high quality mixed methods research study. To design a mixed study, researchers must understand and carefully consider each of the dimensions of mixed methods design, and always keep an eye on the issue of validity. We explain the seven major design dimensions: purpose, theoretical drive, timing (simultaneity and dependency), point of integration, typological versus interactive design approaches, planned versus emergent design, and design complexity. There also are multiple secondary dimensions that need to be considered during the design process. We explain ten secondary dimensions of design to be considered for each research study. We also provide two\ncase studies showing how the mixed designs were constructed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Judith Schoonenboom  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["R.
