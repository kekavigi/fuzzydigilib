{"Nomor": 32539, "Judul": "What is Software Architecture?", "Abstrak": "Currently there is no consensus on what exactly software\narchitecture is or where the boundary between software architecture design and application design lies. In this paper the\nconcept of a software architecture is analyzed from a number\nof different perspectives. In particular, it is argued that a\nsoftware reference architecture is a relatively pure specification of a software architecture as it addresses only infrastructural and quality concerns and does not provide any application functionality. Two examples of widely adopted reference architectures are analyzed in order to gain a deeper understanding of the concept of a software architecture. Current definitions of software architecture are analyzed and\nthree classes of software architecture definitions are identified. The differences of the concept of software architecture\nacross these classes is discussed and their relationships to\ncurrent architecture description languages are explored. It\nis argued that none these definitions provide a sound basis for differentiating between application and architecture\ncomponents. Based on insights obtained from the analyzed\nreference architectures, the paper proposes a new definition\nof software architecture as well as a specification of the elements of a software architecture specification. Software\narchitecture is defined as the software infrastructure within\nwhich application components providing user functionality\ncan be specified, deployed and executed. It is argued that a\nsoftware architecture description should include, across levels of granularity, the basic concepts and constraints within\nwhich application components are to be specified, the architectural components addressing technical concerns, the\nintegration infrastructure, and the architectural strategies\nused to concretely address quality requirements.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "FRITZ SOLMS [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Architecture", "Kata Kunci": "software architecture, reference architecture", "Sumber": "https://dl.acm.org/", "Staf Input/Edit": "Perpustakaan Prodi Arsitektur", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2018"}
