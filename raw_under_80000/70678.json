{"Nomor": 70678, "Judul": "THE POLYMORPHISM OF VESPID WASPS (HYMENOPTERA; VESPIDAE) FROM INDONESIA WITH MORPHOLOGY-BASED CLADISTIC ANALYSIS", "Abstrak": "Vespidae is a worldwide-distributed family of Hymenoptera with almost 4,600 valid species. Wasps are generally yellowish-black with a whitish or brownish color, but some are polymorphic, with marking patterns and color grading within species. Little is known on the taxonomic distribution of this marking pattern in Vespidae, so this study may invite us to analyze the marking pattern of the wasp (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) with wide distribution in the Indonesian Archipelago and the correlation with their biogeographical distribution pattern to make a further intensive study to establish their taxonomic status. Specimens from three different locations (Bandung, Sumedang, and Purworejo), and specimens from Museum Zoologicum Bogoriense (MZB) were studied. A total of 31 distinct character individuals from five species are studied. The morphological features of all taxa described and analyzed the data were coded and analyzed using cladistic methods. This study presents the cladogram trees from every five species (Phimenes flavopictus, Polistes stigma, Apodynerus troglodytes, Vespa affinis, and Vespa velutina) with their biogeography distribution. The cladistic analysis revealed the relation height of each clade containing the closest and furthest relation of the morphological characters. The arrangement of clades was congruent by the Euclidean method in R studio. The result shows that Phimenes flavopictus has two clades based on the marking pattern on their thorax and abdomen, meanwhile, other species (Polistes stigma, Vespa affinis, Vespa velutina, and Apodynerus troglodytes) have three clades based on their color grading and all segments marking pattern. The distribution of the Vespidae species is considered as scattered regarding their pattern that is randomly distributed among locations.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Yelsha Ramadhila": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/272119"}, "Penulis": "Yelsha Ramadhila [20620006]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Intan Ahmad Musmeinan, Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Biologi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Ilmu dan Teknologi Hayati", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Aposematism, Cladistic, Hymenoptera, Polymorphism, Vespidae, Wasp", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Jan 2023"}
