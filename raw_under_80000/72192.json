{"Nomor": 72192, "Judul": "USING MATHEMATICS TO SOLVE REAL WORLD PROBLEMS: THE ROLE OF ENABLERS", "Abstrak": "The purpose of this article is to report on a newly funded research project in\nwhich we will investigate how secondary students apply mathematical modelling to\neffectively address real world situations. Through this study, we will identify factors,\nmathematical, cognitive, social and environmental that Benable^ year 10/11 students to\nsuccessfully begin themodelling process, that is, formulate and mathematise a real world\nproblem. The 3-year study will take a design research approach in working intensively\nwith six schools across two educational jurisdictions. It is anticipated that this research\nwill generate new theoretical and practical insights into the role of Benablers^ within the\nprocess of mathematisation, leading to the development of principles for the design and\nimplementation for tasks that support students\u2019 development as modellers.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Vincent Geiger [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Gloria Stillman, Jill Brown, Peter Galbriath,  Mogens Niss"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Applications .
