{"Nomor": 70033, "Judul": "GAS LIFT WELL PERFORMANCE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING", "Abstrak": "A gas lift well requires precise tuning of its operating parameters to give its production\nperformance, which is a complex process. Conventional approaches encountered significant\nchallenges in resolving the well production prediction with numerous parameters and multiple\nwells, which could give a considerable load to the production engineer. Machine Learning is\nan application focused on improving programs that could learn from various operational\nexperiences. Implementing Machine Learning in gas lift operation to predict oil production\ncould provide significant working time reduction since they enable a simulation of the behavior\nof a gas-lifted well using historical data without modeling the well in commercial software.\nThis paper presents a prediction of gas lift oil production by utilizing some machine learning\nalgorithms, which use the existing data from the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE)\nrepository as time series data. Four algorithms, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages\n(ARIMAX), Vector Auto Regression (VAR), Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Prophet\nwere studied, and their results were compared to the actual gas lift well data and commercial\nsoftware results. The study shows that LSTM was the best model among the other three models\nindicated by the lowest evaluation metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean\nSquare Error (RMSE) of 36.33 and 54.36, respectively.\nThe average difference between the LSTM model result from the actual data was 4.8% while\nthe well model resulted in a 9.7% average difference from the actual data. This machine\nlearning model was then used to predict the oil production of another well in the range of the\nfirst well oil production data, resulting in a relatively low average difference of 4% from the\nactual produced oil data.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Muhammad Adhim Mulia": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/269173", "COVER Muhammad Adhim Mulia": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/290980", "BAB 1 Muhammad Adhim Mulia": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/290981", "BAB 2 Muhammad Adhim Mulia": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/290982", "BAB 3 Muhammad Adhim Mulia": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/290983", "BAB 4 Muhammad Adhim Mulia": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/290984", "BAB 5 Muhammad Adhim Mulia": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/290985", "DAFTAR Muhammad Adhim Mulia": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/290986"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Adhim Mulia [22220302]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Amega Yasutra, S.T., M.T.", "Silvya Dewi Rahmawati, S.Si., M.Si., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Artificial Lift, Gas lift, Production, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Prediction", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "8 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Des 2022"}
