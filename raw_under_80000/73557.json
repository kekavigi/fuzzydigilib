{"Nomor": 73557, "Judul": "ENHANCING WATERFLOOD FIELD PERFORMANCE THROUGH INJECTION RATE OPTIMIZATION USING THE CAPACITANCE RESISTANCE INJECTOR-PRODUCER MODEL (CRM-IP) APPROACH: A CASE STUDY IN X FIELD", "Abstrak": "Waterflooding is widely recognized as one of the most effective and commonly employed methods for enhancing oil\nrecovery in diverse oil fields around the world. It is popularity stems from the efficiency and accessibility in obtaining\ninjection fluids, making it a preferred choice among operators. Effective reservoir management in waterflooding fields\nrequires quick actions to optimize fluid distribution and improve areal and vertical sweep efficiency during the\nsecondary process. Reservoir characterization and simulation are the most important activities in order to evaluate\nreservoir performance. Currently, reservoir simulation is one of the methods that is commonly used by petroleum\nengineer. However, complexity in the geological system, limited understanding of interwell connectivity, vertical\nheterogenity, long time consuming, and lack of injection and production controls lead to lower-than-expected flood\nperformance.\nThis study shows waterflood optimization process using CRM-IP coupled with fractional flow model for onshore oil\nfields that have 18 active water injection well and 24 active productions well with Python programming language.\nThe Liquid production rate history data and Injection rate history data will be used to find the connectivity and time\nconstant parameters in CRM-IP equation by using SLSQP in Python sci-kit learn library. The fractional flow equation\nby (Gentil, 2005) is used for predicting the maximize oil production with optimized distribution of water injection\nrate.\nThe result of this study shows that waterflood optimization model successfully constructed using CRM-IP with only\ninjection rate and production rate history data. The time that is needed to run the optimization model is less than 3\nminutes. The cumulative oil production is predicted will increase 20.45% in the next 120 months if the total field\ninjection rate remains the same, but the distribution is optimized. However, if the total field injection rate is increase\nto 60,000 BWIPD, the cumulative oil production is predicted will increase to 27.3% with the optimized distribution\nof injection rate. By using CRM-IP technique, waterflood management within this study can be done faster than\nconventional approaches. Therefore, the decision taken for optimization in this field could be more effective.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Isroqi Mutahajjid": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/293591"}, "Penulis": "Isroqi Mutahajjid [12219019]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Silvya Dewi Rahmawati, S.Si, M.Si., Ph.D.", "Marja Dinata"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "waterflooding, Capacitance Resistance Modeling (CRM), reservoir, connectivity", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Jun 2023"}
