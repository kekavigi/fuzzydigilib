This study was conducted to comprehensively analyze the production performance of steam flooding in the \u201cD\u201d Field. This study attempts to evaluate the feasibility of implementing a steam flooding expansion. The current study used a methodology to design steam injection, examine field data performance, and forecast steam flood performance. This included an analysis of various aspects such as injection pattern, injection techniques, completion design, water treatment system, and steam flood production performance. The current study examines the production performances of steam injection in Region 1, focusing on the potential expansion in the R1 sand reservoir of Region 2. Additionally, a solution is proposed for the issue of heat transfer splitting between reservoirs.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Kevin Henry Wirata": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/293451"}, "Penulis": "Kevin Henry Wirata [12219096]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Rani Kurnia, S.Si., M.T.", "Muhamad Aji, S.T., MBA"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "steam flood, production performance, analysis", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Jun 2023"}
