{"Nomor": 73437, "Judul": "MATRIX ACIDIZING: A CASE STUDY OF SKIN EVOLUTION PREDICTION FOR UNTREATED LIMESTONE FORMATION", "Abstrak": "Matrix acidizing is a cost-effective method used in petroleum industry by pumping acid and other fluids to remove\nnear-wellbore formation damage and increase well productivity. Skin factor is measured through well test analysis\nbefore and after the treatment, and continuous monitoring can provide valuable insights.\nThis study focuses to model skin evolution using three different skin factor calculation methods, Paccaloni\nmethod, Prouvost & Economides method, and Hill & Zhu method. Source of the model is two treated zones in\n\u201cN\u201d and \u201cK\u201d limestone formations with depth range from 6975 ft to 7310 ft. Parameters from well test and few\nassumptions are used as input for the skin evolution model. The skin evolution model then is used to predict skin\nfactor of three different zones in \u201cK\u201d and \u201cT\u201d limestone formations with depth ranges from 6405 ft to 6615 ft.\nThe practicality and reliability for each method is then assessed as reference for future use.\nThe results of this study shows that the different methods have given out a similar result in skin factor and skin\nevolution. Skin factor value deviation is affected by permeability thickness (kh) and skin evolution is matched.\nHigher permeability thickness of 1210 mdft is highly deviated by 127 to 136 and lower permeability thickness of\n76.5 mdft slightly deviated by 3 to 11 from well test references. Skin evolution prediction results for the untreated\nzones produces a very high initial skin factor of 4159, 1563, and 355 with steep decrease on early injection rates.\nThe analysis of this study can be used to determine the optimum point where the matrix acidizing job ends and\nwhich method is the most practical to use in field.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Richard Rinaldi Kurniawan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/293381"}, "Penulis": "Richard Rinaldi Kurniawan [12219079]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ardhi Hakim Lumban Gaol, S.T., M.Sc., Ph.D.", "Steven Chandra, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Matrix Acidizing, Skin factor, Skin evolution", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Jun 2023"}
