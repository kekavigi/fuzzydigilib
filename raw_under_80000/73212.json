{"Nomor": 73212, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT OF A MONOCULAR VISUAL-BASED POSITIONING AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM FOR A MICRO UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE IN AN INDOOR ENVIRONMENT", "Abstrak": "The limitations of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in enclosed\nspaces have prompted the need for alternative methods for determining the\nposition and navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). One potential\nsolution is to employ visual-based sensors and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms.\nThis study aims to explore the feasibility of a monocular vision-based\npositioning system for determining the position of a UAV by placing a sensor\nin a fixed position and feeding the image stream to an AI algorithm to generate\nthe position and navigation solution. The results of this study could have\npractical applications, particularly inspection hangars where GNSS cannot be\nused. Automating the inspection process using UAVs could also help reduce\nthe risk of human injury associated with elevated working spaces by improving\nthe safety and efficiency of the inspection process.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Rifqi Widy Himawan [13619022]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Khairul Ummah, S.T., M.T.", "Dr. -Ing.
