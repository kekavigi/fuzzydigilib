{"Nomor": 72798, "Judul": "HEAP LEACH STABILITY ANALYSIS USING PFC2D", "Abstrak": "Leaching is one of the methods used to process gold ore from mining. In the whole mining and processing process,\nleaching is one of the processes that can cause the material to experience a reduction in grain size. To determine\nihe effect of grain size reduction on heap leach stability, an analysis was performed using the PFC2D program.\nThis program can model the heap leach material as particles that have contact forces with each other. The model\nthat will be made is heap leach with input parameters in the form of microparameters and grain size distribution\nthat is adjusted to the grain size of the material in the field. The output obtained from PFC2D can be in the form\nof the principal stress received by the material on the heap leach. The principal stress obtained will be plotted on\nthe Mohr Coulomb curve. From these plots, it is found that the principal stress of the heap leach material is close\n\nto the strength envelope, which means that the heap leach is in the critical region or near to instability.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Syani Liffa Suci": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/291233", "2022 SYANI LIFFA SUCI 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/291234", "2022 SYANI LIFFA SUCI 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/291235", "2022 SYANI LIFFA SUCI 1-PAPER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/291236"}, "Penulis": "Syani Liffa Suci [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Tri Karian, Simon Heru Prassetyo, and Budi Sulistianto"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Mei 2023"}
