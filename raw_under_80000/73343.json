This study addresses hostile corrosion issues, notably in gas well completion design, by estimating the production system performance, predicting erosion-corrosion damage, perform tubing stress analysis, and proposing a new recompletion plan based on the results.\nThe case study revolves around an existing well \u201cX\u201d located in Central Java Region, penetrating Kujung formation where three DSTs were performed indicating the substantial presence of H2S and CO2 as sour gas. The completion plan incorporates a cased hole perforation, optimal tubing selection, and consideration of alloy materials for the required sour service equipment.\nBased on the available field data from DST findings, bottomhole pressure surveys, and the existing conceptual well design, the basic aim is to convert this well to be completed prior to put on production. This study also emphasizes the significance of material selection for every OCTG where CRA is recommended to be utilized in this application. In consequent, a maximum corrosion rate of 15.04 mm/yr with no erosion damage show that Nickel Alloy SM253 and SM2242 (3% Mo) are the most suitable materials for this case. The chosen materials can be associated with the tubing weight and grade selection followed by a comprehensive tubing stress analysis resulting a safe, dependable, and effective tubing design for this abrasive operation.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Ida Ayu Laksmi Kusuma Wardhani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/293277"}, "Penulis": "Ida Ayu Laksmi Kusuma Wardhani [12219048]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ardhi Hakim Lumban Gaol, S.T., M.Sc., Ph.D.", "Wijoyo Niti Daton, S.T, M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "corrosion, sour gas, completion, material selection, tubing stress analysis", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Jun 2023"}
