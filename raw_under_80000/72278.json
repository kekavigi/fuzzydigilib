{"Nomor": 72278, "Judul": "KULITKU - RECOGNIZING AND ANALYZING SKIN DISEASE USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK", "Abstrak": "Based on Pusdatin Kemkes 2010, skin diseases are ranked third out of the ten most\ncommon diseases in Indonesia. Only a few of them have access to dermatology because they feel\ntoo ashamed to go to the doctor while having serious diseases like herpes or severe acne. Because\nof that, many people do self-diagnosis about their skin conditions that can make their skin even\nworse. Kulitku app is an application to detect and analyze skin conditions and give medicine or\nskincare recommendations. We target anyone with various skin conditions who wants to maintain\ntheir skin health and needs recommendations about the product that can help them to improve\ntheir skin. This application can help to analyze their skin using convolution neural networks to\nclassify their skin problems. The application will give information about products that can help to\nmaintain their skin without contradicting their base skin condition. \nHow did your team come up with this project?\nThere are 1.9 billion skin problems, whether they are serious diseases or mild. But, there are\nonly 10% of people who have dermatology and treatment access. Therefore, there are so many\npeople who diagnose their disease themselves, then they consume and use skincare products on\nthe market.\nEverybody can get infected skin and subcutaneous diseases. In the Tropical countries, such\nas Indonesia, these cases are easily found in society. Based on Indonesia Health Profile Data (2010),\nshows that skin diseases become the third of the ten most diseases in hospital's outpatient in\nIndonesia", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Emmeril Kahn Mumtadz": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/288382"}, "Penulis": "Emmeril Kahn Mumtadz [13117073]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
