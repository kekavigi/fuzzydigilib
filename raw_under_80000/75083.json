{"Nomor": 75083, "Judul": "OPTIMIZING THE PRODUCTION FROM APPLICATION OF INFLOW CONTROL DEVICE IN HORIZONTAL WELL OF UJUNG PANGKAH FIELD", "Abstrak": "reservoir, with its main focus being oil production. To develop the field and increase oil productivity in this area, a plan has been made for drilling a horizontal well. Due to the heel toe effect, there is a concern about early water breakthrough at the top and bottom of the horizontal well or in locations with high permeability. If early breakthrough of water occurs, the well will experience a decline in production. To address this issue, Inflow Control Devices (ICDs) are used to equalize pressure drop along the horizontal well section, preventing breakthrough in certain parts of the horizontal well. Dynamic modeling is required to determine the impact of ICDs on the horizontal well and to understand the changes in well production over the desired time period.\nIn this case study, 5 ICDs with the same nozzle size were installed in each ICD of the X well and have been in operation for 4 years since 2019. However, after forecasting the production of oil and water, there has been a decrease in oil production, necessitating optimization of this well.\nThe result of this study is to determine which scenario is most effective in increasing cumulative oil production and reducing cumulative water production. Based on simulations using tNavigator software for 4 different scenarios, it can be concluded that Scenario I, which involves changing the nozzle size in ICD 2 and 4 to 1.6 mm, is superior to the other scenarios.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Yeheskiel R Sinulingga": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/299714"}, "Penulis": "Yeheskiel R Sinulingga [12219093]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wijoyo Niti Daton, S.T, M.T.", "Prasandi Abdul Aziz, S.SI., M.T.", "Muhammad Fikri Pawitra, S.T.", "Wahyu Agung Rahmanto, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "ICD, heel toe effect, horizontal well, cumulative oil.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Jul 2023"}
