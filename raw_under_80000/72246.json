However, feedback research in medical education has typically\nfocused on information provided by tutors to students with limited exploration of the\ninfluence of context. This research seeks to address this gap by exploring the influence of\nmultiple contexts upon feedback processes. Employing video-ethnography methodology\nwe explored feedback in two common contexts for medical student learning: the simulated\nclinical environment and the medical workplace. Learning and teaching sessions were\nfilmed in each of these contexts, capturing diverse feedback processes. Data were analysed\nfor key themes using a Framework Analysis approach and similarities and differences\nbetween the two contexts identified. In total 239 distinct feedback episodes across 28\ndifferent teaching and learning sessions were captured, with feedback processes relating to\nthe patient, practice, educational and institutional contexts observed. In this paper, we\nconcentrate on key similarities and differences in feedback processes between the two\ncontexts with respect to six themes: feedback interlocutors, interlocutor positioning,\nfeedback types, feedback foci, feedback styles and feedback milieu. We argue that feedback\nis inextricably linked to the multiple contexts in which feedback is enacted. It is only\nby exploring these contextual influences that feedback can be understood more fully. With\nsuch understanding we should be better placed to develop interventions capable of\nimproving the long elusive experience of successful feedback.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "L. M.
