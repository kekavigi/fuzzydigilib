{"Nomor": 72095, "Judul": "INTERACTION DESIGN FOR DIGITAL LIBRARY APPLICATION, IPUSNAS, WITH DESIGN THINKING APPROACH", "Abstrak": "In 2016, the National Library of Indonesia (Perpusnas RI) initiated a digital library\napplication called \"iPusnas\" as an effort to cultivate reading interest among the public\nand shift the public's reading pattern to a digital form [1]. The iPusnas application\nhas become a relevant innovation from Perpusnas to reach a wide range of people\nand equalize reading access for those who cannot visit Perpusnas directly. Based on\ndesk research conducted on the \"Ratings & Reviews\" column of the iPusnas\napplication on Play Store on May 12, 2022, many users still feel dissatisfied with the\ncurrent condition of the iPusnas application. It was found that the most common\nreason for this dissatisfaction was related to the user experience (UX) of the iPusnas\napplication. It was mentioned that the interface of the current iPusnas application is\nconsidered old-fashioned or not in line with current design trends.\nTo support the wide use of the iPusnas application by the public, this study is\ncompiled to find a design solution that can address the user experience problems of\nthe application using a Design Thinking approach. The design solution in this study,\nformed as a high-fidelity prototype. The high-fidelity prototype is tested on the\niPusnas application users using a number of metrics, including the System Usability\nScale (SUS) and the Net Promoter Score (NPS). The results of this study show that\nthe SUS score of the design has a higher score compared to the current iPusnas\napplication, which is 86.73, while the current iPusnas application has an SUS score\nof 77.43. In addition, the design solution is also tested to determine the level of user\nloyalty in voluntarily recommending iPusnas using the NPS. The NPS score of the\ncurrent version of the iPusnas application is 60.36 and 62 for the tested high-fidelity\nprototype. This score shows an improvement in the user's satisfying aspect towards\nthe design solution worked on in this study.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Resha Puspita Dewi [18217014]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dicky Prima Satya, S.T, M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sistem dan Teknologi Informasi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Teknik Elektro dan Informatika", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "digital library, UX, high-fidelity prototype, iPusnas, Design Thinking", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Dessy Rondang Monaomi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Mar 2023"}
