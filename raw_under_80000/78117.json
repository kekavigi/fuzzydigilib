This study \naims to iden-fy the knowledge level of people aged 45 or older and their percep-on of diabetes. A \ncross-sec-onal, prospec-ve method was used for this study and primary data was collected from \n300 respondents through a ques-onnaire comprised of the Diabetes Knowledge Ques-onnaire \n(DKQ-24) and the diabe-c Health Belief Model (HBM) or the Brief Illness Percep-on Ques-onnaire \n(B-IPQ) for non-DM and DM respondents respec-vely. Descrip-ve and inferen-al sta-s-cal analysis \nwas conducted in this study. Results showed that respondents tend to have a lack of knowledge on \ndiabetes (61.67%, n = 300). Demographic characteris-cs that have an effect on the level of \nknowledge are educa-on level, monthly income, ownership of health insurance, diagnosis of nondiabetes chronic illness, and family history of diabetes (p < 0.05). Furthermore, results showed that \nrespondents show a slight inclina-on to have a posi-ve percep-on toward diabetes (52%). \nDemographic characteris-cs that affect the percep-on of non-DM respondents are educa-on level, \nmonthly income, ownership of health insurance, family history of diabetes, and BMI or obesity (p < \n0.05). Associa-on analysis between knowledge level and percep-on showed a significantly strong \ncorrela-on (p = 0.001, Cramer\u2019s V > 0.25). To conclude, individuals in Bandung City aged 45 and \nolder showed a lack of knowledge yet a posi-ve percep-on toward diabetes, and there is a strong \ncorrela-on between knowledge and perception\nKeywords: diabetes mellitus, age risk factor, knowledge, perception", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Raissa Fattya": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/309476"}, "Penulis": "Raissa Fattya [11619103]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. apt.
