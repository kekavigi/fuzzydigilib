{"Nomor": 72255, "Judul": "PLACE-BASED NATURE KINDERGARTEN IN VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA: NO TOOLS, NO TOYS, NO ART SUPPLIES", "Abstrak": "The last decade has witnessed a steady increase in the number of preschool\nprograms operating in Australia where children access a natural outdoor space (in the\nbush, at the beach or in local parkland) for an extended period of time each week. Over\na hundred such programs are now estimated to be operating in Victoria alone. In this\npaper Victorian educators from the Early Childhood Outdoor Learning Network\nrespond to concerns regarding the direction of Forest Schools and the commodification\nof Forest School practices in the UK as raised by Leather, Journal of Outdoor and\nEnvironmental Education (2018), and the suggestion that a similar model of Forest\nSchools has spread to Australia. It is argued that the proliferation of nature kindergarten\nprograms in Victoria has followed a more organic trajectory that is less about emulating\na set of imported practices, and more about responding to local conditions andinfluences. \nTeaching practice in these programs has been described as \u2018naked pedagogy,\u2019\nemphasizing the role of child-led play without \u2018tools, toys and art supplies.\u2019 The\nauthors argue that, despite a considerable and growing body of both popular and\nacademic literature on the benefits of nature and play, few studies have explored this\ntype of nature kindergarten program in the context of early childhood education in\nAustralia.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ame Christiansen", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Siobhan Hannan, Karen Anderson"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Forest school .
