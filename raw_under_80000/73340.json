Considering its smaller surface footprint and ability to support higher production rates with higher water\ncuts than other artificial lift methods, this equipment is often selected for an artificial lift for the oil wells at\nsome point in its life cycle. However, costs related to pump failure and workover are expected to be millions of\ndollars annually if it happens. It has become crucial to monitor the pump in real-time to prevent the impending\nfailure of the pumps.\nThe ammeter chart is the earliest diagnostic tool for ESP performance. After that, the downhole measurements\nwere utilized to get more precise downhole conditions. Furthermore, for more robust diagnostics tools, the\noperator often combines an ammeter chart, downhole sensor data, and well-test data. However, it has a lot of\ninformation to be evaluated for one pump at one time. For one pump, seven parameters must be evaluated which\nare average ampere, flow rate, motor temperature, intake temperature, discharge pressure, intake pressure, and\nvibration. If one pump is required to evaluate seven parameters, then for a whole field, let\u2019s say 300 wells, it is\nrequired to evaluate 2100 parameters at a single time.\nIn this study, an algorithm is built to generate a single parameter that could be used to detect the operating\ncondition of the pump which is normal or not. The seven parameters the pump used as input to the algorithm,\nthen the algorithm generates a single parameter at a single time. Therefore, to monitor a field with 300 wells, it\nis only required to evaluate 300 parameters, seven times less than conventional way.\nThis study used fourteen datasets from fourteen different wells in one of the fields in Indonesia. The model was\nverified by real pump conditions, then the model results are compared with ammeter chart and downhole sensor.\nAt the end of the study, real-time electrical submersible pump monitoring dashboard is simulated with one of\nthe datasets. This study concludes that the new parameter is as sensitive as downhole sensor but simple to\nmonitor as well as ammeter chart.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Zumar Jatsiyah Hadiid Hermawan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/293272"}, "Penulis": "Zumar Jatsiyah Hadiid Hermawan [12219045]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Silvya Dewi Rahmawati, S.Si, M.Si., Ph.D.", "Marda Vidrianto, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "ESP, PCA, unsupervised machine learning, monitoring", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Jun 2023"}
