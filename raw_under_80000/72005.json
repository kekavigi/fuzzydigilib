{"Nomor": 72005, "Judul": "PENAMBAHAN COSOLVENT PADA SURFAKTAN ZWITTERIONIC-ANIONIC UNTUK MEMFORMULASI SURFAKTAN BERPERFORMA TINGGI", "Abstrak": "Chemical enhanced oil recovery is term referring to tertiary recovery of oil recovery operations using chemicals to\ndisplace additional oil after the secondary recovery process became uneconomical. Surfactant is necessary for reducing\nthe IFT value that improves the microscopic displacement. There are thousands combination that could be used for\ndiscovering the highest-performance surfactant for reducing IFT. This study is focused on formulating the highperformance\nsurfactants from combination between zwitterionic and anionic surfactants and the co-solvent addition\n(isopropyl alcohol).\nIn this paper, there is a mixture that shows the form of better microemulsion than other mixtures of zwitterionic and\nanionic surfactants at surfactant total concentration of 0.5wt% surfactant in phase behavior test. The addition of cosolvent\n(isopropyl alcohol) at 0.3% of salinity system make the mixture form a middle-phase microemulsion and\ndecreases the viscosity. From the IFT measurement using spinning-drop method, the mixture shows optimal salinity\nis at 2.5% of NaCl. This result shows that the addition of co-solvent has a vital role in stabilizing aqueous stability of\nsurfactants mixture and reducing IFT value between oil and surfactants solution.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Abdurrahman Wahid [12218044]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
