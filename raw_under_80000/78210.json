{"Nomor": 78210, "Judul": "STUDI TEKNO EKONOMI OCEAN THERMAL ENERGY CONVERSION DI LAUT BANDA, MALUKU", "Abstrak": "The increasing demand for electricity is closely tied to the progress of the industrial\nsector and population growth over time. However, this trend is accompanied by the\ndepletion of fossil fuels, which serve as the primary source of electrical energy.\nOcean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) emerges as one of the latest options\nfor green and renewable energy sources. Indonesia possesses significant potential\nfor OTEC development due to its equatorial location, resulting in higher sea surface\ntemperatures compared to non-equatorial regions. One of the promising locations\nfor OTEC construction is the Banda Sea, characterized by its deep waters and a\ntemperature difference between the sea surface and deep waters of approximately\n28?. In the development of OTEC, there are several challenges, especially from\nthe financial aspect, such as production prices which are still relatively high.\nTherefore, a financial feasibility study is needed for the ocean current power plant\nto be built in the Banda Sea. Using multilinear regression, 3 fitting scenarios were\nobtained ranging from optimistic, moderate, and pessimistic scenario, whilst the\noptimistic is chosen having the biggest potential out of all. The scenario based on\nthe electricity distribution area is divided into two regions, Seram Island and Buru\nIsland. To increase the revenue and the possibility of feasibility, clean water and\nfish & shrimp export demand are added. Using the data collected, CAPEX, OPEX,\nLoan, Instalment with 5 years payback period, and LCOE are determined. There\nare several parameters that can measure the feasibility of the financial aspects of a\nproject, Net Present Value (NPV), and Benefit Cost Ratio (B/C) with , an interest\nrate of 8.5% and an inflation rate of 3.22% are used. The estimated Commercial\nOperation Date from OTEC varies, 2041 and 2056 until 2071, 2030 and 2045 until 2060, 2051 and 2066 until 2080, lastly 2035 and 2050 until 2065 with a service life\nof 30 years for each scenario. The results obtained from the financial analysis are\nthat OTEC is not feasible to be built in the Banda Sea in every scenario.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Bagus Satria Pangestu [15519024]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
