The\ngrave socio-economic impact of African swine fever infection at a global level makes large-scale rapid and robust diagnosis a\ncritical step towards effective control. Here, we describe multiple-probe-assisted DNA capture and amplification technology\n(MADCAT) \u2014 a novel, sensitive, simple, and high-throughput method for detecting ASFV directly from whole blood or\nother complex matrices. Through a unique DNA capture approach which specifically captures the target DNA onto 96-well\nplate for subsequent amplification, MADCAT abandons the complicated extraction protocol and achieves ultrafast and\nhigh-throughput detection. The sample-to-result time for 96 samples is about 90 min, as compared with the 3\u20134 h time of\nthe conventional real-time qPCR method. The limit of detection (LOD) of MADCAT is 0.5 copies/?L blood and is 5 times\nmore sensitive than an extraction-based qPCR assay when testing serially diluted whole blood samples. The assay is 100%\nspecific against other common swine pathogens. In the clinical diagnosis of 96 field samples, all 22 positive samples were\ncorrectly identified with lower Ct values than extraction-based qPCR, confirming its high diagnostic sensitivity (100%).\nOwing to its high-throughput, specific high sensitivity, and direct detection features, MADCAT shows great potential for\nuse in large-scale ASFV surveillance and monitoring for effective disease control.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Huicong Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hongru Pian, Lihua Fan, Jian Li, Jifei Yang, Zhi Zheng"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "African swine fever \u00b7 DNA capture \u00b7 Laboratory diagnosis \u00b7 High-throughput \u00b7 Without DNA extraction", "Sumber": "Springer", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Feb 2023"}
