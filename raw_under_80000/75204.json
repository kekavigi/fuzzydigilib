{"Nomor": 75204, "Judul": "COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF GAS LIFT METHODS FOR DECLINING RESERVOIR LIQUID RATE", "Abstrak": "Maintaining or enhance production rates in oil and gas reservoirs that are depleting, effective artificial lift techniques must be used. Natural flow rates decrease as reservoirs get older because the reservoir pressure drops. High water cut, viscosity fluctuations, and difficult wellbore conditions are additional variables that hinder the natural flow of hydrocarbons. Artificial lift techniques are required to get around these limitations and increase productivity. Operators in Indonesia can regulate bottom hole pressure and maximize fluid flow from wells by using the right artificial lift techniques. The goal of this study is to investigate and evaluate various artificial lift strategies in order to identify the best strategy for increasing output in depleting reservoirs.\nArtificial lift techniques, including Coiled Tubing Gas Lift (CTGL), Continuous Gas Lift (CGL), and Intermittent Gas Lift (IGL), are the main focus of this work. The objective is to compare the performance and effectiveness of these commonly used artificial lift methods. The study utilizes a comprehensive methodology, including simulation and sensitivity tests, to assess the capabilities of these techniques in managing declining reservoir conditions and maximizing production.\nCGL gas lift method demonstrates superior performance compared to natural flow, resulting in a 27% higher liquid rate at a reservoir pressure drop to 1050 psi. Increasing the gas lift injection depth leads to higher liquid rates, with CGL consistently achieving the highest rates among the methods evaluated. Effective gas injection rates are identified for each gas lift technique, highlighting significant liquid rate outcomes for both CTGL and CGL. Water cut analysis further shows that CGL outperforms CTGL at low water cut levels, while IGL proves highly effective for very high water cut conditions.\nComparison study helps production optimization teams and reservoir engineers choose the best artificial lift technique for increasing production and extending the useful life of depleting reservoirs. The research findings highlight that CGL is effective in low water cut conditions, while IGL demonstrates superiority in high water cut conditions. These insights are crucial in guiding decision-making for operators to select the most suitable gas lift method to optimize oil production depending on the existing water cut levels.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Farid Aminullah Ikhwan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/299931"}, "Penulis": "Farid Aminullah Ikhwan [12219028]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ardhi Hakim Lumban Gaol, S.T., M.Sc., Ph.D.", "Silvya Dewi Rahmawati, S.Si, M.Si., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "gas lift, liquid rate, sensitivity analysis", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Jul 2023"}
