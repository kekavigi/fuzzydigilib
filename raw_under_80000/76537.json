{"Nomor": 76537, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT OF USER INTERFACE FOR RED TILAPIA AQUACULTURE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM APPLICATION", "Abstrak": "Even though technology in fish farming in Indonesia is still needs to improve, today's technological\nadvances have made Indonesians use smartphones. Current technological advances have enabled\nus to measure water quality more modernly. The thing that needs attention is the application design\nthat is suitable for managing water quality in red tilapia ponds. This final project aims to develop\nan appropriate interface for red tilapia aquaculture management system applications on the\nAndroid and iOS platforms. This application was created using a user-centered design interaction\ndesign approach with usability goals good utility, and user experience goals helpful. The usability\ntesting results show that the specified usability and user experience goals are achieved. In addition,\nthe results of the user acceptance testing conducted showed that the five participants completed 46\nof the 46 existing test cases. This indicates that the application is feasible and can be accepted by\nfish farmers.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Haikal Lazuardi Fadil [13519027]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Nur Ulfa Maulidevi, S.T, M.Sc.", "Dr.Eng.
