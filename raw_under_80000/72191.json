{"Nomor": 72191, "Judul": "SCIENCE TEACHER IDENTITY AND ECO-TRANSFORMATION OF SCIENCE EDUCATION: COMPARING WESTERN MODERNISM WITH CONFUCIANISM AND REFLEXIVE BILDUNG", "Abstrak": "This forum article contributes to the understanding of how science teachers\u2019\nidentity is related to their worldviews, cultural values and educational philosophies, and to\neco-transformation of science education. Special focus is put on \u2018reform-minded\u2019 science\nteachers. The starting point is the paper Science education reform in Confucian learning\ncultures: teachers\u2019 perspectives on policy and practice in Taiwan by Ying-Syuan Huang\nand Anila Asghar. It highlights several factors that can explain the difficulties of implementing\n\u201cnew pedagogy\u201d in science education. One important factor is Confucian values\nand traditions, which seem to both hinder and support the science teachers\u2019 implementation\nof inquiry-based and learner-centered approaches. In this article Confucianism is compared\nwith other learning cultures and also discussed in relation to different worldviews and\neducational philosophies in science education. Just like for the central/north European\neducational tradition called Bildung, there are various interpretations of Confucianism.\nHowever, both have subcultures (e.g. reflexive Bildung and Neo-Confucianism) with\nsimilarities that are highlighted in this article. If an \u201cold pedagogy\u201d in science education is\nrelated to essentialism, rationalist-objectivist focus, and a hierarchical configuration, the so\ncalled \u201cnew pedagogy\u201d is often related to progressivism, modernism, utilitarianism, and a\nprofessional configuration. Reflexive Bildung problematizes the values associated with\nsuch a \u201cnew pedagogy\u201d and can be described with labels such as post-positivism, reconstructionism\nand problematizing/critical configurations. Different educational approaches\nin science education, and corresponding eco-identities, are commented on in relation to\ntransformation of educational practice.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jesper Sjostrom [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Cultural values \u00b7 Worldviews \u00b7 Reform-orientation \u00b7 Reconstructionism \u00b7 Philosophy of science educationCultural values \u00b7 Worldviews \u00b7 Reform-orientation \u00b7 Reconstructionism \u00b7 Philosophy of science education", "Sumber": "Springer", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Mar 2023"}
