{"Nomor": 72520, "Judul": "APPLICATION OF TIME LAPSE MICROGRAVITY METHOD ON WATER INJECTION SIMULATION", "Abstrak": "Reservoir water injection is basically intended to increase the reservoir pressure, thus remain oil in the pore space of the reservoir rock is displaced by water and moves toward production wells. When one fluid displaces, there are density changes caused by altering in fluid saturation and pressure. In the time lapse microgravity technique, the density changes associated with water replacing oil can be detected with high resolution surface gravity measurements.\nThe main objective of this preliminary study is to identify front of water injection based on density and saturation value resulted in numerical simulation. We apply numerical approximation of two-phase immiscible and incompressible problems using IMPES method in conjunction with time lapse microgravity formulation. The basic method used is finite volume scheme to approach the pressure equation and finite difference scheme to discretize the saturation and density equations. Simulation results show that water front and concentration history of the displacing fluid can be identified.", "Daftar File": {"2006 SUSANTI ALAWIYAH 1-PAPER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287891", "2006 SUSANTI ALAWIYAH 1-COMMITTEE.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/291172", "2006 SUSANTI ALAWIYAH 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/291173", "COVER Susanti Alawiyah": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/291174", "2006 SUSANTI ALAWIYAH 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/291176"}, "Penulis": "Susanti Alawiyah [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wawan Gunawan A.
