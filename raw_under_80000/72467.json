{"Nomor": 72467, "Judul": "GROUND PENETRATING RADAR FOR NICKEL LATERITE EXPLORATION: A CASE STUDY IN PAKAL ISLAND, INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "With the increasing demand of batteries for electrical\nvehicle in world, the interest of nickel laterite exploration\nand then its exploitation grow significantly. Nickel ore is\none of the raw materials for making these batteries, which\nhas high economic values, and is widely found in Indonesia.\nTherefore, extensive nickel exploration in Indonesia is\nurgently required to obtain the estimation of its potential\nresources. Until now, data from boreholes in close proximity\nto each other are used to calculate Nickel ore resources. To\nreduce the number of used boreholes and therefore reducing\noperational costs, Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) is\nsuitable method for that purpose due to its cost -and time\neffectiveness. In this research we analysis two GPR profiles\nacquired with GSSI SIR-3000 system with unshielded 40\nMHz antennas from GPR campaign in Pakal Island. After\napplying conventional processing steps such as time zero\ncorrection, dewow, bandpass filtering f-k filtering, and\nbackground removal, radar attributes are assigned. From\npreliminary results using instantaneous frequency and its\ncomparison with borehole data as validation tool, we\nobtained interesting results about the boundaries of limonite,\nsaprolite, and bedrocks. The next step will be frequency\ncontent clustering in each layer boundary with the aim of\nclarifying layer boundaries.", "Daftar File": {"WWP - Ground Penetrating Radar for Nickel Laterite Exploration.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/286814"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Arief Wicaksono [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mordekhai, Wahyudi Parnadi, Muhammad Chandra R.M."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Nickel laterite; Ground-Penetrating Radar; GSSI SIR-3000; instantaneous frequency; limonite; saprolite", "Sumber": "-", "Staf Input/Edit": "Devi Septia Nurul", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Mar 2023"}
