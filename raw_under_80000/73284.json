However, with the majority of large gas fields in Indonesia now in the mature stage, where a substantial\nportion of the recoverable gas volume has already been extracted, new challenges arise. One of the prominent\nissues faced by mature gas wells is the phenomenon of liquid loading, which significantly restricts gas production.\nIn some cases, losses attributed to liquid loading account for as much as 30% of the total production. Therefore,\nit becomes crucial to address this issue to maximize the productivity of mature gas wells.\nTo mitigate the impact of liquid loading, various technologies and methods are available, with surfactant\ninjection, particularly foam injection, emerging as a cost-effective solution. Foam agents serve as foaming agents,\nfacilitating the removal of liquids from gas wells. The effectiveness of foam injection is influenced by several\nfactors, including the gas production rate, gas-liquid ratio, and dosage of surfactant (concentration of foaming\nagent). Optimal foam concentration is crucial for achieving efficient liquid removal and enhancing gas production.\nTo address liquid loading challenges, it is imperative to conduct a deliquification implementation study before a\ngas field reaches its mature or declining stage. Early identification of liquid loading issues allows for timely\ninterventions to mitigate the problem, ensuring continuous production and preventing well shut-in.\nThis research aims to investigate the behaviour of mature gas wells and identify the optimal timing for\nintervention to address liquid loading. The study will analyze the impact of foam injection as an intervention\nmethod and perform a sensitivity analysis on varying surfactant concentrations to determine their effectiveness in\nmitigating liquid loading issues. Through gaining insights into the behaviour of mature wells and determining the\nideal foam concentration, this research seeks to contribute to the development of strategies for effectively\naddressing liquid loading challenges in gas wells.\nBased on the findings of this study, the presence of liquid loading in the gas wells analysed was\nconfirmed, with increased water production and decreased gas production. The calculations demonstrated that the\nexisting condition of the well indicates an inability to remove the accumulated liquid without intervention, leading\nto the current shut-in status. Increasing the foam concentration showed promising results, reducing the minimum\nrate of liquid loading and increasing the production rate. Foam injection has emerged as an effective and costefficient\nmethod for liquid removal.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Kezia Tiomarina Mutiara T": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/293199"}, "Penulis": "Kezia Tiomarina Mutiara T [12219008]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Silvya Dewi Rahmawati, S.Si, M.Si., Ph.D.", "Firmanta Sembiring"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "liquid loading, foam injection, mature gas wells, foam concentration, well productivity.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Jun 2023"}
