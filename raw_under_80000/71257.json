{"Nomor": 71257, "Judul": "KAJIAN PARAMETER METEOROLOGI UNTUK KEPERLUAN TAKE OFF/LANDING PADA RUNWAY BANDAR UDARA INTERNASIONAL HUSEIN SASTRANEGARA TAHUN 2013-2022", "Abstrak": "Husein Sastranegara International Airport is the main airport located in Bandung, West Java. Most of the air transport activities take place at this airport. Topographically Husein Sastranegara International Airport is located in the basin of Bandung so that when building this airport can not just take the direction of the runway. So that weather and climate information is needed for flight operations related to the smooth start of the aircraft from take off to landing.\nThis study processed two meteorological data, namely wind data and visibility data every hour from 2013 to 2022 at Husein Sastranegara International Airport. Wind data will be processed based on wind direction and speed. Wind direction data will be processed by WRPLOT application and wind speed data will be calculated percentage of wind components, namely headwind, tailwind, and crosswind. Visibility Data is processed and results in the percentage of visibility events below the safe limit for flight. From the data processed will be found the Times (seasons, months, and hours) that require vigilance to make landings and take offs.\nOn runway 11, the highest percentage of headwind component occurrences were in the JJA season, tailwind and l-crosswind components were in the DJF season, and the largest R-crosswind component was in the MAM season. The percentage of headwind components was highest in January, tailwind components in October and L-crosswind components, and r-crosswind components in May and June. At 6-10 WIB is the best time to take off and landing because the percentage of occurrence of headwind components is higher than other components. At 12-21 WIB, it is less recommended to take off and landing because the percentage of tailwind component events is higher than other wind components. At 7 WIB and 16 WIB need to watch out because the crosswind component is highest at that hour. On runway 29, the opposite occurs where the headwind component becomes tailwind and the L-crosswind component becomes r-crosswind. The highest percentage of visibility with an incidence of less than 5 km occurred in the MAM season with the highest incidence at 7 WIB and the lowest at 12 WIB.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ariq Rafif Dhia [12817009]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Musa Ali Mustofa, S.Si., M.Si."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Meteorologi", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Ilmu dan Teknologi Kebumian", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Aviation, Wind directions, Wind components, Visibility, Runway, Husein Sastranegara", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Jan 2023"}
