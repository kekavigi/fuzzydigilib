{"Nomor": 71458, "Judul": "COMPARISON OF TRANSIENT ELECTROMAGNETIC AND DC RESISTIVITY FOR AQUIFER LAYER IN CISARUA, BANDUNG BARAT REGENCY", "Abstrak": "Geophysical investigation is conducted to study groundwater in water absorption region for Bandung Basin\nhydrology system. It is placed in Cisarua, Bandung Barat Regency, which composed of old and young volcanic\nproducts. Resistivity based geophysical methods are used, Geoelectrical Resistivity and Transient\nElectromagnetic (TEM). TEM measurement are usingused long grounded wire configuration with transmitter\nlength 500 m and current 13 A. Geoelectrical Resistivity are usingused Wenner-Schlumberger configuration\nwith maximum array distance 560 m. TEM Measurement recorded high amount of cultural noise since it is was\nnear to cellular and radio transmitters. After filtering and inversion process, low resistivity zone (35-40 ?m) are\nwere detected at elevation 1185\u20131075 m. Deeper low resistivity zone assumed to have high water saturation are\nwere also detected at 210 \u2013 -290m. This resultsed are were correspond with Geoelectrical Resistivity\nmeasurement which detecteddetect low resistivity zone at 1185 \u2013 1140 m, with lowest resistivity value was 32\n?m. In Geoelectrical Resistivity Section, we can could see that the low resistivity zone is was continuous from\nnorth to south. From both methods, the low resistivity zone are were interpreted as shallow unconfined aquifer\nserve as water source for domestic well in study zone.", "Daftar File": {"Prosiding - Comparison of Transient Electromagnetic and DC - Agus laesanpura.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/277419"}, "Penulis": "A.
