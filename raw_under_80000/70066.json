{"Nomor": 70066, "Judul": "PENGEMBANGAN TUGAS PEMELIHARAAN PREVENTIF UNTUK SISTEM SMARTMT TRUK BAHAN BAKAR MENGGUNAKAN FAILURE MODE AND EFFECT ANALYSIS (FMEA) DAN MSG-3", "Abstrak": "PT X is currently developing the SmartMT system, a system intended to improve\nthe safety and digitalization of fuel distribution operations, which will be installed\non their fuel truck fleet and includes several features to assist the driver and the fleet\nmanagement in monitoring the condition of fuel truck. In order for the system to\noperate in a good performance, it is necessary that the system is maintained on a\nregular basis. The SmartMT system, however, still lacks a proper maintenance\nprogram, leading to a heavy reliance on replacement work whenever a breakdown\noccurs. For this reason, an analysis to develop a maintenance program for this\nsystem is required. In this thesis, Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) and\nMaintenance Steering Group 3 (MSG-3) analysis will be conducted for the purpose\nof identifying possible failures and developing preventive maintenance tasks for the\nSmartMT system\u2019s maintenance program. The FMEA aims to identify the\nfunctional failures, their modes and causes, as well as the corresponding failure\neffects. Meanwhile, MSG-3 analysis is intended to categorize the failures, which\nhas been listed during FMEA, based on their effects and to select the appropriate\nmaintenance tasks to address the issues. Furthermore, a comparison between the\nestimated financial risk of run-to-failure approach and preventive maintenance is\nprovided in the form of a risk acceptability graph to evaluate which option is more\neffective.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Karina Dara Puspita [13618073]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
