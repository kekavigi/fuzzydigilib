{"Nomor": 70120, "Judul": "STRESS ANALYSIS OF UNDERGROUND ROAD CROSSING GAS PIPELINECASE STUDY: SUBAN", "Abstrak": "Pipelines are still the main choice for transport oil and gas due to its resilience,\nreliability, safety, and lower cost. Most road crossing pipelines are located\nunderground. Many protections from the loads can be used such as additional pavement\nand warning signs.\nUnderground road crossing pipelines withstand stresses caused by the internal\nload, earth load, and live load. These loads are effected by the pipe and fluid\nspecifications, soil and environment data, and the vehicle data. The vehicle used in this\nthesis will be over dimension and over loading (ODOL), as many cases of ODOL have\nbeen found in Indonesia. A manual calculation of the stress can be done by using\nrecommended practices, in which in this undergraduate final project utilizes API RP\n1102: Steel Pipelines Crossing Railroads and Highways. A stress analysis using the\nfinite element method is also conducted using a computer software, namely Abaqus,\nwhich shows the von Mises stress and displacement of the pipeline.\nThe use of rigid pavements as the contact of the vehicles crossing towards the\nstress of the pipeline is that it decreases the stress experienced by the pipeline. The\nresults of the stress of the case study, which uses data of burial depth of 8 ft and rigid\nas its\u2019 pavement type shows a value of 4,785 psi and is within the allowable range. All\nthe other parametric studies have shown results that are still within the allowable range.\nThe stress is found to be directly proportional to the displacement of the underground\nroad crossing pipeline. From the parametric studies, it is shown that the total effective\nstress decreases as the burial depth is higher.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Taqiya Tsamara": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/269336"}, "Penulis": "Taqiya Tsamara [13118230]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
