The quantity of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted into the Earth's atmosphere has been directly influenced by the production of oil and gas.One of the biggest challenges in reducing CO2 emissions in Indonesia\u2019s oil and gas industries is the constantly growing need for fossil fuels as well as the lack of carbon tax on Indonesia\u2019s law. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) will significantly minimize CO2 emissions that cause the greenhouse effect and temperature rise on earth. CO2 source for field LAB is extracted from natural gas production and will be transported and stored in a geological site to be utilized as CO2 storage.\nThe prevailing approach for conveying carbon dioxide (CO2) to the designated injection site involves the utilization of a pipeline system, which facilitates the transfer of captured CO2 from field conditions to the intended injection point. Impurities are invariably present in the field circumstances of carbon dioxide (CO2) that is conveyed through pipelines. The presence of contaminants within CO2 fluid can have a significant influence, with the extent of this impact being contingent upon the composition of the components. Previous research has demonstrated that the level of CO2 purity has a notable impact on the transportation of CO2 through pipelines, particularly in terms of the associated transportation expenses.\nFive main stages comprise this study. Fluid modeling for three impurity levels is the first step in this work to determine the phase envelope. The next step is to create a pipeline model and simulate fluid behavior in the pipeline. If problems or unfavorable results occur during the third phase, the pipeline model is refined and optimized again to achieve optimal results. The fourth phase involves an economic analysis using simulation results to determine the best transportation scenario. Finally, comparative study methods are used to analyze the data from the previous four steps.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Lutfi Abel Baskara": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/307864"}, "Penulis": "Lutfi Abel Baskara [22221304]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Silvya Dewi Rahmawati, S.Si, M.Si., Ph.D.", "Antonius Indarto, S.T, M.Eng., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "CO2 Pipelines, CO2 Transport, Carbon Capture and Storage, Flow Assurance", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Sep 2023"}
