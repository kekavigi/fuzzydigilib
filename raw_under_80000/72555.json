{"Nomor": 72555, "Judul": "STATE OF THE ART OF CO2 STORAGE GEOPHYSICAL TECHNOLOGY AND THE  PILOT STUDY IN GUNDIH FIELD, CENTRAL JAVA PROVINCE, INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "This paper presents the state of the art of CO2 storage technology and the preliminary study of GeologyGeophysics-Reservoir (GGR) which is intended to determine the best CO2 storage around the Gundih field. This\npreliminary study is the first stage from a research project of \"Pilot Study for Carbon Sequestration and Monitoring in \nthe Gundih field, Central Java Province, Indonesia\", as a collaboration research between Indonesia and Japan. Whereas \nthe second stage is the geophysical monitoring step to make sure that there is no CO2 leakages during and after injection \nis carried out. The expected outcome of the overall study is to provide guidance on the application of geophysical \ntechnology in determining the CO2 storage and monitoring as well as to increase the hydrocarbon production. The \nsuccess of this study could then be applied to other fields in Indonesia.", "Daftar File": {"State of the Art of CO2 Storage Geophysical Technology and the.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/288476"}, "Penulis": "Wawan Gunawan A.
