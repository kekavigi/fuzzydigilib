{"Nomor": 76134, "Judul": "PENERAPAN KETERSEDIAAN TEKNOLOGI BERPOTENSI UNTUK MENGURANGI PENULARAN COVID-19 DI BANDARA.", "Abstrak": "The airport remains to be the gateways of the world and is one of the mediums at which causes the pandemic to proliferate. As governments and institutions across the world stricken travelling with health regulations, airport activity is halted: and so are international agendas.\nAs an approach to co-exist with COVID-19 and a precaution for future airborne pandemics, possible technologies that is able to nullify the transmissions of a viral airborne virus is sought after. It is the aim of this thesis to provide a depiction of possible alternatives that is best in its effectiveness, cost, and advantages when applied in an airport to reduce the transmission of airborne pandemics.\nIn this research, it determines alternatives of the best used technology to prevent the transmission of diseases caused by airborne viruses (COVID-19) in a closed room or hall. Its effectiveness is quantified by the risk of infecting an individual and then calculated the cost-effectiveness of the prevention method. It is also proposed a method to evaluate the required numbers of equipment and calculation of the budget need in total expenditure and the consequence on unit cost per passenger.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ruffi Chiantama Mulia Suhartan [13617108]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
