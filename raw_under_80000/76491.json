{"Nomor": 76491, "Judul": "EXPRESSION OF MISTIC-GFP FUSION IN BACILLUS SUBTILIS", "Abstrak": "Despite the varying important roles of membrane proteins such as ion transport, transmembrane \nsignaling, secondary metabolites synthesis, and many more, the expression of heterologous \nmembrane protein in prokaryotes remains a challenge. Formation of inclusion body, competition of \nexpression between the heterologous and the essential protein, inactivated protein, and death of the \nhost cells due to toxicity are still commonly encountered. One of the strategies to overcome these \nchallenges is by fusing Mistic (Membrane-Integrating Sequence for Translation of Integral Membrane \nProtein Construct) with the membrane protein. Mistic has been proven in assisting the heterologous \nmembrane protein expression in Escherichia coli. However, it has not been implemented yet for\nheterologous membrane protein expression in Bacillus subtilis. In this research, the mistic \u2013 green \nfluorescent protein construct (mstX-gfp) in pDR111 plasmid was transformed to B. subtilis and its \nexpression were observed using a fluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscope. The construct\nhas been successfully transformed and the expression showed the emission of green fluorescence \nfrom GFP. However, the localization of GFP in the membrane cannot be concluded yet and requires a \nfurther study.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Fataya Hasna Jati": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/303446"}, "Penulis": "Fataya Hasna Jati [10719206]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. apt.
