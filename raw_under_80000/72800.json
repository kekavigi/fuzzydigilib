Parameters such as production rates and mining grades enhance\nihe complexity of underground mining optimization challenges. The availability of stope dimension optimization\nsoftware currently allows engineers to perform numerous simulations involving a combination of. stope\ndimensions, mining costs, production targets, and ore grades, resulting in the best mining scenario heing a high\nmining valuation while also valuing safety operation of the underground mine. This study employs stope dimension\noptimization approaches on marginal gold vein deposirs, altering he parameters of stope dimensions, mining\ncosis, production rates, and ore grade as input parameters. Stope dimensions variatians, changes in mining COSItS\nrelated to stope dimensions: ore grade variation and related production target variation are input parameters for\noptimization. Later, the hill of value approach is used to determine the greatest value using a 3D graph of the\neconomic value in all possible situations in this optimization. The best scenario will be chosen, while the sensitivity\nof each group of scenarios will be evaluated by taking into account! the benefits and drawbacks of each scenarios.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Danu Putra": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/291238", "2022 DANU PUTRA 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/291239", "2022 DANU PUTRA 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/291240", "2022 DANU PUTRA 1-PAPER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/291241"}, "Penulis": "Danu Putra [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Tri Karian and Budi Sulistianto"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Mei 2023"}
