{"Nomor": 77937, "Judul": "FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS OF CORE DENSITY AND FIBRE ORIENTATION EFFECT TOWARDS FOAM CORE SANDWICH COMPOSITE DAMAGE RESPOND DUE TO LOW VELOCITY IMPACT", "Abstrak": "Technological advancement evolves and grows in rapid speed, especially in the last 2-3 decades. One of the most affected sector is the transportation industry where the aircraft is the most forefront application of technological advancement. One of the most used materials for aircraft is sandwich composite structure. However, composite has a vulnerability towards low-velocity impact (LVI). Therefore, responds of sandwich composite needs to be studied further in regard to LVI. This paper presents low-velocity impact simulation of PVC and PMI foam-core sandwich composite with carbon fibre material in the facesheet. Model of sandwich composite uses cohesive zone modelling (CZM) and continuum damage model (CDM) for its damage modelling. Simulations are done by varying two variables, one at a time. Those variables are core density (65, 100 and 160 kg/????3) and fibre orientation stacking (unidirectional [0]8, quasi-isotropic [45/?45/90/0]????, cross-ply [0/90]4 and angle-ply [\u00b145]4 ) of both laminates. Effects of those variable towards the interlaminar, intralaminar and core damages are then studied by looking at its force-time, force-displacement, damage profile and damage area of laminate. Damage mechanism by core is also scrutinized by looking at its stress and deflection during impact. Analysis shows that core density and fibre orientation have strong correlation with the structure rigidity and how it responds to damage, for each of its component. Results also shows that fibre orientation plays a big role on the rigidity of structure, which in turn, affects how the structure responds towards low-velocity impact.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Athiyya Wikantari Maharani [13619023]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
