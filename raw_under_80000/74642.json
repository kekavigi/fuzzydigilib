{"Nomor": 74642, "Judul": "NEW EMPIRICAL PATH LOSS FORMULA FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL CHANNEL MODELING USING METAHEURISTIC OPTIMIZATION", "Abstrak": "Channel modeling for High Speed Rail (HSR) is fundamental to design a reliable\nwireless communication system. A common practice is to conduct a tremendous\namount of channel measurement data by deriving statistical method in order to\nachieve the appropriate channel models. For HSR communications, channel\nestimation in channel modeling enables high bandwidth physical layer\ntransmission in state-of-the-art mobile communications. The recent development\nof HSR as an emerging of a high mobility transportation system introduces new\nchallenges to create a reliable channel modeling communications due to its\ncomplexity and inaccuracy. Accurate and efficient channel models considering\nboth large-scale and small-scale fading characteristics are crucial for the design,\nperformance evaluation, and parameter optimization of HSR wireless\ncommunication systems.\nFading in the HSR wireless communications can be categorized into large-scale\nand small-scale fading. The large-scale fading explains the main characteristics of\nthe channel such as path loss and shadowing. Large-scale fading cases examine\nthe relationship between path loss and separated distance between the transceiver\nin multiple environments such as in HSR scenarios. While small-scale fading\ncases go over to the relation between the Doppler spread and time coherence. Both\nfactors are very meaningful in conducting a reliable channel modeling for HSR.\n\nThe primary concern in this study is the investigation of path loss for HSR which\ncontributes to large-scale fading. A new approach of conducting path loss\nprediction for HSR is introduced by proposing new empirical path loss models for\nHSR to be utilized in free space and urban/suburban propagation. The state-ofthe-\nart path loss models for HSR are validated using metaheuristic optimization\ntechniques which have never been investigated in any literatures.\nThe initial procedure in this study addresses a validation procedure of path loss\nmeasurement of HSR from Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU) by utilizing Na\u00efve\nBayes classification method. The validation procedure is conducted priorly in this\nstudy because the proposed new empirical path loss models are underlied upon\nthe measurement. path loss\nmodels for HSR are constructed. The first model is based from the free space\npropagation characteristic, assuming the transmitter and receiver are located in an\notherwise empty environment. However, when this free space propagation is not\nsufficient enough to mitigate the maximum los e\ncharacteristics, another path loss model is also introduced. The two ray ground\nreflection path lossmodel for HSR is proposed as a more accurate model assuming\nthe combination of direct signal path and reflected path from the earth. This model\nis meant to mitigate the losses in urban and suburban\nenvinronment with a minimum antenna height of 50 meter. Both of these path loss\nmodels are validated by utilizing the metaheuristic optimization technique.\nThe utilization of metaheuristic optimization technique model is performed on the\nproposed path models because of its applicability in obtaining the optimal path\nloss parameter values where physical phenomenon must be taken into account in\na very dynamic system such as HSR. As both proposed path models comprise the\ncorresponded los characteristics, the special MIMO antenna\nfor HSR is specially designed in which its gain becomes the constant in the\nconstructed path loss model.\n\nThe final stage of this research reports the power link budgets for HSR to be\nutilized in low and high frequency spectrum. The dataset is once again optimized\nusing the combination of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and coeffiecient\ncorrelation in order to constraint the technical parameters in the power link budget\nso the obtained path loss values are in the range of observation. However, in a low\nfrequency spectrum, correction factors are calculated by utilizing a point-to-point\npath loss model. Satisfying results of Received Signal Level (RSL) in power\nlink budgets for both allocated frequency spectrum and propagations are achieved.\nFinally, the designed power link budgets are readily to be utilized by network\ndesigners to deploy the frequency planning and optimal base stations for HSR to\nits best performances.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Selvi Lukman": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/298605"}, "Penulis": "Selvi Lukman [33319004]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ing.
