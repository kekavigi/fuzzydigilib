Using a multiple methodological research approach and analysis, the study\nexamines whether aggregated and disaggregated data exist to verify AIS\u2019 superior\nacademic achievement in U.S. k-12 schools. The study reveals a lack of data to\nsubstantiate the claim. Instead, the study reveals a paucity of research on AIS\u2019\nacademic performance and achievement in k-12 schools, as well as academic\nunderperformance and underachievement, and the challenges that exist. The notion\nof a \u2018\u2018model minority\u2019\u2019 attributed to African immigrants is disingenuous and a\ndisservice to AIS in U.S. k-12 schools. The paper discusses significant implications\nand recommendations for policy and practice that include overhauling the data\ncollection and reporting system, data disaggregation for AIS, debunking the African\nimmigrant \u2018\u2018model minority\u2019\u2019 ascription, preparing culturally responsive and globally\ncompetent teachers, and increasing research on AIS in k-12 schools.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Omiunota N.
