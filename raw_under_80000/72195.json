{"Nomor": 72195, "Judul": "TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION IN PRESCHOOL: PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHILDREN TO USE ARTIFACTS AND TO CREATE", "Abstrak": "In recent years, technology has been emphasized as an important area in early\nchildhood curricula; however, in many countries preschool does not have the tradition of\nteaching specific subjects, and research shows that many preschool staff members are\nunsure about what teaching technology should include and how it should be taught.\nTherefore, with the ambition of outlining recommendations for both preschool practice and\nthe preschool-teacher program, we investigated what elements staff members include in\neducating preschool children in technology. We investigated the research question What do\npreschool staff members include as elements of technology education in preschool?\nthrough open-ended items on a questionnaire completed by 102 preschool teachers and\ndaycare attendants in Sweden. The answers were analyzed inductively, resulting in a set of\nseven categories: Artifacts and systems in children\u2019s environments, Create, Problem\nsolving, The concept of technology, Experiments, Techniques/Motor skills, and Natural\nscience. Some key results emerged. First, artifacts have a central place in preschool\ntechnology education, and at least three verbs relate to how these artifacts are addressed:\nuse, create, and understand. Second, the content of technology education in government\nregulatory documents is described to varying extents by the participants, and sometimes\nnot at all. Third, expected elements like play and the important role of the staff are not\nexpressed in the answers. Possible explanations and implications for the results are\ndiscussed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Pernilla Sundqvist [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Tor Nilsson"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Technology education, Preschool, Early childhood education, Preschool teacher, Preschool staff, Conventional content analysis", "Sumber": "Springer", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Mar 2023"}
