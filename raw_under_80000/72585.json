{"Nomor": 72585, "Judul": "EFFECTS OF SOIL ACIDIFICATION ON SOIL EROSION IN OPEN-CAST COAL MINES IN INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "Soil erosion which easily progresses due to heavy rain in the tropical climate is a serious issue for mined-land\nreclamation in Indonesia since it causes plant death. Moreover, acidification of soils occurs because of sulfide\nminerals in mining area. The physical properties of soils are changed by the acidification of soils according 10\nprevious studies. Thus, since the erosion rate of soils greatly depends on physical characteristics of soils, the\nrelation between the change of physical properties of soils caused by soil acidification and soil erosion has to be\nconsidered for erosion control in mining area. In this study, physical properties of the soil samples in which the\nsoil-oH was adjusted with H2SO, were measured, followed by the artificial rainfall test with the samples in order\nto understand the effect of acidification of soils on erosion rate. The results showed that the decrease of cohesive\nstrength among soil particles caused by the decline of consistency limit with soil acidification resulted in the\nincrease of erosion rate. Hence, soil acidification should also be prevented with the measures against soil\nerosion for successful mined-land reclamation.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Shinji Matsumoto": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289127", "2016 SHINJI MATSUMOTO 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289128", "2016 SHINJI MATSUMOTO 1-PAPER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289130"}, "Penulis": "Shinji Matsumoto [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Shunta Ogata, Hideki Shimada, Takashi Sasaoka, Ginting Jalu Kusuma"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "3 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Apr 2023"}
