The study\ntakes an abductive reasoning approach to analyze scientists\u2019 videotaped lectures to\nrecognize what scientists pay attention to in their explanations of climate science\npractices. It then analyzes how ideas scientists attended align with experienced teachers\u2019\nsense-making of scientific practices to teach climate change. The findings show that\nexperienced teachers\u2019 and scientists\u2019 explanations showed alignment in the focus on\nscientific practices, but indicated variations in the temporal and spatial reasoning of\nclimate data. Furthermore, the interdisciplinarity of climate science was emphasized in\nclimate scientists\u2019 lectures, but was not apparent once scientists and teachers shared the\nsame culture in meetings to provide feedback to preservice teachers. Given the importance\nof teaching through scientific practices in classrooms, this study provides suggestions\nto capture the epistemic diversity of scientific disciplines.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Asli Sezen-Barrie [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "Springer", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan \u00a0\n                                     Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Mar 2023"}
