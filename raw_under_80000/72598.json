{"Nomor": 72598, "Judul": "VARIOUS SPECTRAL INDICES FOR IDENTIFYING MINE VOID USING SENTINEL 2 IMAGE", "Abstrak": "Mine voids are one of the resulting land changes from mining activities, especially coal mining using the open pit\nmethod. Mine voids could be filled with rain water and groundwater, which in turn become pit lakes. Pit lakes are\nclassified as miscellaneous reclamation options - \u201cReklamasi Bentuk Lain\" and can be utilized as water\nreservoirs, flood controls, ecosystem buffering, aguaculture, agriculture and/or power generation. Nevertheless,\nwithout proper management, mine voids yield the potential to harm human beings and the environment. Therefore,\nthe existence af mine voids needs to be identified spatially and temporally to monitor and prepare a management\nPlan as soon as possible. The existence of objects on the earth 's surface, including mine voids, can be remotely\nacguired using remote sensing technigues, including using satellites. Sentinel 2 satellite imaginary data can be\nused for land change and monitoring, thus mine voids can be identified spatially and temporally using these data.\nIn this study, mine voids mapping was carried out initially to extract water bodies based on land cover\nclassification using various spectral indices, ie., NDVI, NDWI, and mNDWI and then the accuracy for each\nclassification was assessed by calculating the Kappa value. The NDWI-based classification shows higher Kappa\nvalues than NDVI and mNDWI, thus giving a more accurate classification. Further Jiltering processes of water\nbodies using Mine Permit Area (WIUP) polygons are done to identify mine voids which are located within WIUP.\nIn 2018, there are 192 potential mine voids within WIUP and 34 potential mine voids outside WIUP, while in the\nyear 2020 there are 219 potential mine voids within WIUP and 31 potential mine voids outside WIUP. Voids\nmapping in this study could roughly classifv mine voids but other water bodies within WIUP (setiling ponds,\nsumps) could not be further distinguished. In addition, the geometrical parameters of mine voids are poorly\ncalculated by this method. Additional methods need to be applied to increase ihe accuracy of determining,\nclassifying and calculating mine voids and their geometrical parameters.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Leta Lestari": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289261", "2022 LETA LESTARI 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289262", "2022 LETA LESTARI 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289263", "2022 LETA LESTARI 1-PAPER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289264"}, "Penulis": "Leta Lestari [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ginting Jalu Kusuma, Abie Badhurahman, Sendy Dwiki, Rudy Sayoga Gautama, Salmawati"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Teknik Pertambangan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "mine voids, spectral indices, Sentinel 2, WIUP, coal mining", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani \u00a0\n                                     Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Apr 2023"}
