{"Nomor": 72527, "Judul": "EXPERIMENTAL STUDY ON CO-AXIAL SYSTEM WITH A HORIZONTAL WELL OF UNDERGROUND COAL GASIFICATION TO EVALUATE GASIFICATION EFFICIENCY", "Abstrak": "Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) is a technique to recover the energy of coal by converting coal into gas.\nOne or two wells are drilled from the surface to underground coal seam in order to inject oxidant which consists\nof oxygen and air for burning the coal seam in situ and recover syngas such as carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and\nmethane in the surface as an energy source. Unused coal resources which have not been recovered for technical\nand economic reasons are expected to be used in this technology. In this research, a large scale experiment which\nuses an artificial coal block was conducted, and a co-axial UCG system with a horizontal well was adopted to\nobtain results of temperature in the coal block and product gas components. Based on the results, gasification\nefficiency was calculated, then it was compared with past experimental results for evaluation. Regarding the\ntemperature inside the coal block, the area above the coaxial hole had the highest temperature, with a peak value\nat 1200 to 1400 \u00b0C. Furthermore, the peak value at 15 cm above the coaxial hole was 1000 to 1200 \u00b0C, indicating\nthat the high temperature had expanded up to 15 cm above the coaxial hole. Meanwhile, the main product gas\ncomponents are nitrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and methane. Finally, the result of\ncomparing gasification efficiency with those of previous experiments shows that the gasification efficiency was\ncomparable despite the coal quality is lower than that of the previous experiment.", "Daftar File": {"2020 YOSHIMITSU MAKABE 1-ACCEPTANCE LETTER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287981", "COVER Yoshimitsu Makabe": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287982", "2020 YOSHIMITSU MAKABE 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287983", "2020 YOSHIMITSU MAKABE 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287984", "2020 YOSHIMITSU MAKABE 1-ISBN.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287985", "2020 YOSHIMITSU MAKABE 1-PAPER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287986"}, "Penulis": "Yoshimitsu Makabe [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Akihiro Hamanaka, Ken-ichi Itakura, Jun-ichi Kodama, Gota Deguchi, Nuhindro Priagung Widodo, Budi Sulistianto, Takashi Sasaoka and Hideki Shimada"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani \u00a0\n                                     Resti Andriani", "File": "6 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Apr 2023"}
