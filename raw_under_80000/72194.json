{"Nomor": 72194, "Judul": "KNOWLEDGE AND POWER IN THE TECHNOLOGY CLASSROOM: A FRAMEWORK FOR STUDYING TEACHERS AND STUDENTS IN ACTION", "Abstrak": "The purpose of this paper is to develop and illustrate an analytical framework for\nexploring how relations between knowledge and power are constituted in science and\ntechnology classrooms. In addition, the empirical purpose of this paper is to explore how\ndisciplinary knowledge and knowledge-making are constituted in teacher\u2013student interactions.\nIn our analysis we focus on how instances of teacher\u2013student interaction can be\nunderstood as simultaneously contributing to meaning-making and producing power\nrelations. The analytical framework we have developed makes use of practical epistemological\nanalysis in combination with a Foucauldian conceptualisation of power,\nassuming that privileging of educational content needs to be understood as integral to the\nexecution of power in the classroom. The empirical data consists of video-recorded\nteaching episodes, taken from a teaching sequence of three 1-h lessons in one Swedish\ntechnology classroom with sixteen 13\u201314 years old students. In the analysis we have\nidentified how different epistemological moves contribute to the normalisation and\nexclusion of knowledge as well as ways of knowledge-making. Further, by looking at how\nthe teacher communicates what counts as (ir)relevant knowledge or (ir)relevant ways of\nacquiring knowledge we are able to describe what kind of technology student is made\ndesirable in the analysed classroom.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Anna T.
