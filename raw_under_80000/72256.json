{"Nomor": 72256, "Judul": "PROMOTING ARGUMENTATION COMPETENCE: EXTENDING FROM FIRST- TO SECOND-ORDER SCAFFOLDING THROUGH ADAPTIVE FADING", "Abstrak": "Argumentation is fundamental for many learning assignments, ranging from\nprimary school to university and beyond. Computer-supported argument scaffolds can\nfacilitate argumentative discourse along with concomitant interactive discussions among\nlearners in a group (i.e., first-order argument scaffolding). However, there is no evidence,\nand hence no knowledge, of whether such argument scaffolds can help students acquire\nargumentation competence that can be transferred by the students themselves to various\nsimilar learning tasks (i.e., second-order argument scaffolding). Therefore, this conceptual\narticle argues that the focus of argument scaffold design and research should be\nexpanded: from the study of first-order scaffolding alone to including the study of\nsecond-order scaffolding as well. On the basis of the Script Theory of Guidance (SToG),\nthis paper presents a guideline for second-order argument scaffolding using diagnosis of\nthe student\u2019s internal argumentative script and offering adaptive external support and\nvarious fading mechanisms. It also explains how to complement adaptive fading support\nwith peer assessment, automatic response tools, and adaptable self-assessment to ensure\nthat learners actually understand, learn, and apply targeted argumentation activities in\nsimilar situations.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Omid Noroozi", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Paul A.
