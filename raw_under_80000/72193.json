{"Nomor": 72193, "Judul": "CIVIC REPUBLICAN SOCIAL JUSTICE AND THE CASE OF STATE GRAMMAR SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND", "Abstrak": "The aim of this paper is to consider the ways in which civic republican theory\ncan provide a meaningful and useful account of social justice, one that is which holds\nresonance for educational debates. Recognising the need for educationalists interested in\ncivic republicanism to pay greater attention to ideas of justice\u2014and in particular social\njustice as it concerns relationships between citizens (citizen to citizen, group to group or\ncitizen to group)\u2014it is argued that a form of civic republicanism committed to freedom as\nnon-domination is capable of providing a substantive model for analysing social (in)justice\nwithin educational arenas. After positioning the contribution offered here within existing\neducational literature on civic republicanism, salient elements of social justice as freedom\nas non-domination are identified. On this basis, debates concerning the existence and\npotential expansion of state (public) grammar schools in England are considered in relation\nto the account of republican social justice as non-domination. It is argued that from this\nrepublican position grammar schools (1) represent an arbitrary domination of the interests\nof those less well off by those with greater material and cultural capital and (2) in doing so\nlead to advantages for some at the expense of others. Though the focus of the paper is on\ngrammar schools in England, it is suggested that republican justice may be a useful frame\nfor considering similar educational cases in England and elsewhere.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Andrew Peterson [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Civic republicanism, social justice, education, grammar schools", "Sumber": "Springer", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Mar 2023"}
