The solar industry is a desirable investment, resulting in many recent developments, with silicon solar cells as the most common solar cell. Although silicon solar cells have a high-power conversion efficiency, their manufacturing method is non-environmentally friendly and rather expensive. Thus, a more environmentally friendly and cheaper solar cell is sought-after.\nPerovskite solar cell is an emerging high-potential solar cell that solves these issues of silicon-based solar cells with comparable power conversion efficiency. Perovskite material\u2019s optical properties allow excellent absorption through the whole visible light region. Increasing the solar absorptivity of a solar cell increases the power conversion efficiency. A method to increase solar absorptivity is implementing nanostructure architecture in the solar cell.\nThis research uses a finite element method software, COMSOL Multiphysics, to simulate a perovskite solar cell with various nanostructure architectures, including the shapes, height, and domain area. The nanostructure shapes include nanocone, nanopyramid, nanotube, and nanorod. The result shows that the solar absorptivity over a wavelength of 300-800 nm increases with increased height for tapered shapes. Nanocone has the largest integrated irradiance and light transmission through the cell. Analyzing the integrated irradiance of varied nanocone domain areas shows various local maxima and minima. The result indicates that the nanocone at domain area 300 nm x 300 nm and at height 200 nm gives largest integrated irradiance of 407 W/m2.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Azhar Aditama [13118225]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Poetro Lebdo Sambegoro, M.Sc., Ph.D.", "Dr.Eng.
