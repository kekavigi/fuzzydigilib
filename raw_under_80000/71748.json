{"Nomor": 71748, "Judul": "OMICS-GUIDED BACTERIAL ENGINEERING OF ESCHERICHIA COLI ER2566 FOR RECOMBINANT PROTEIN EXPRESSION", "Abstrak": "The goal of bacterial engineering is to rewire metabolic pathways to generate high-value molecules for various applications.\nHowever, the production of recombinant proteins is constrained by the complexity of the connections between cellular\nphysiology and recombinant protein synthesis. Here, we used a rational and highly efficient approach to improve bacterial\nengineering. Based on the complete genome and annotation information of the Escherichia coli ER2566 strain, we compared\nthe transcriptomic profiles of the strain under leaky expression and low temperature-induced stress. Combining the gene\nontology (GO) enrichment terms and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with higher expression, we selected and knocked\nout 36 genes to determine the potential impact of these genes on protein production. Deletion of bluF, cydA, mngR, and udp\nled to a significant decrease in soluble recombinant protein production. Moreover, at low-temperature induction, 4 DEGs\n(gntK, flgH, flgK, flgL) were associated with enhanced expression of the recombinant protein. Knocking out several motilityrelated\nDEGs (ER2666-?flgH-?flgL-?flgK) simultaneously improved the protein yield by 1.5-fold at 24 \u00b0C induction, and the\nrecombinant strain had the potential to be applied in the expression studies of different exogenous proteins, aiming to improve\nthe yields of soluble form to varying degrees in comparison to the ER2566 strain. Totally, this study focused on the anabolic\nand stress-responsive hub genes of the adaptation of E. coli to recombinant protein overexpression on the transcriptome level\nand constructs a series of engineering strains increasing the soluble protein yield of recombinant proteins which lays a solid\nfoundation for the engineering of bacterial strains for recombinant technological advances.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lizhi Zhou", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yue Ma, Kaihang Wang, Tingting Chen, Yang Huang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Heterologous gene expression \u00b7 Transcriptome analysis \u00b7 Gene deletion \u00b7 Microbial cell engineering", "Sumber": "Springer", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan \u00a0\n                                     Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Feb 2023"}
