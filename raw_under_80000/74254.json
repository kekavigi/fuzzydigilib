JENIS HASS VS MENTEGA UNTUK TUJUAN PERAWATAN KULIT", "Abstrak": "The growing trend of skincare and skin health awareness, particularly highlighted during the 2019 \npandemic, has fuelled the demand for skincare innovations. In Indonesia, the skincare market was valued \nat 29 Trillion Rupiah in 2021 and is projected to grow over 20% by 2023, indicating the increasing market \npotential. Vegetable oils are one example of natural ingredients for skincare that are abundant in \nIndonesia. One of which is avocado oil or Persea americana Mill, that is widely used for its skin \nbenefits. The aim of this experiment is to compare the two types of avocado oil (Mentega vs Hass) through \ncharacterization and identify substances associated with emollient, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant \nproperties, which can serve as valuable raw materials for skincare products. The extraction method \nemployed in this study is the n-hexane reflux method. The result showed that the oil yield extracted from \ndried avocado simplicia was larger in avocado-type Hass (84.70%), rather than avocado-type Mentega \n(54.02%). The oil samples extracted were physiochemically tested according to the standard by SNI \n(National Indonesian Standard) 01-3555-1988 Test method for oils and fats. The SNI Test for avocado \nMentega oil and avocado Hass oil included peroxide value (26 and 26.4 mgrek/kg), iodine value (91.4 and\n97.58 g of I2/100g), acid value (3.06 and 2.51 mg KOH/g), and saponification value (186.31 and 196.58 mg \nKOH/g). Both oil types were in accordance with the SNI standard except for peroxide value, which was \nfound to be higher than the standard. In addition, GC/MS analysis was performed to identify the fatty acid \ncompounds. The result revealed the presence of two fatty acids in avocado oil type Mentega, including\npalmitic acid and methyl palmitate related to skincare purposes. While avocado oil type Hass contains the \npresence of 3 fatty acids such as palmitoleic acid, palmitic acid, and methyl linoleate related to skincare \npurposes. The findings of this experiment indicate that the fatty acids present in avocado type Mentega \noil primarily exhibit components with potential moisturizing activity, while avocado oil type Hass \npossesses components with the additional potential anti-inflammatory, anti-aging and antioxidant \nactivities.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Alya Zahira": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/294827"}, "Penulis": "Alya Zahira [11619105]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Sukrasno, M.S.", "apt.
