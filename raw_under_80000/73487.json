{"Nomor": 73487, "Judul": "NTEGRATED ANALYSIS OF PTS SURVEY DATA AND WELLBORE MODELING FOR GEOTHERMAL WELL CAPACITY ESTIMATION AND FEEDZONE IDENTIFICATION", "Abstrak": "This study focuses on the analysis of the Pressure Temperature Spinner (PTS) data and its integration with wellbore modeling software to estimate the capacity of a geothermal well. The research utilizes PTS survey data and PT shut-in data to identify the feedzone parameters of the well. The analysis involves quality control of the PTS data, calculation of fluid velocity and mass flow rate, and visual interpretation of feedzone identification. The identified feedzones are then used as input for well modeling using the JIWA Flow software. The software requires additional inputs such as pressure drop correlation, wellhead pressure, well trajectory, casing design, feedzone data, and fluid composition. The output of the software includes the well parameter profile and the well's output curve. The well model is calibrated by comparing different correlations, and the Orkizewski correlation is found to provide the smallest overall error. The well modeling results reveal the formation of different flow regimes and validate the cooling phenomenon at certain depths. The modeled well's output curve is compared with production data, showing a decline in production, potentially due to decreased reservoir pressure or production issues. Further analysis of the decline requires additional confirming data. The limitations of the JIWA Flow software are identified, suggesting the need for added features such as correlation comparisons, matching features with given profiles, and sensitivity analysis on inputs. In-depth analysis of production decline and well enthalpy decline requires more data for confirmation and sub-problem elaboration.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Mesias Piere Canilandi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/293464"}, "Penulis": "Mesias Piere Canilandi [12219080]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Eng.
