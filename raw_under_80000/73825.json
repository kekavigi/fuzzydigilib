{"Nomor": 73825, "Judul": "HETEROLOGOUS EXPRESSION OF UPPER MEVALONATE PATHWAY TO PRODUCE MEVALONATE IN BACILLUS SUBTILIS", "Abstrak": "The use of terpenoids is ubiquitous in several industries due to its diverse beneficial functions. As the \ndemand of terpenoids increases, production of terpenoids should be able to compensate for it. Due to \nthe low content of some terpenoids found in nature, alternative methods should be pursued to \nenhance the quantity of terpenoids, and in this study, genetic engineering of the plant synthetic \npathway was chosen. A previous study was already conducted as an effort to construct the upper \nmevalonate pathway to increase the expression of mevalonate intermediate products in Escherichia \ncoli. This study was performed to express the three key genes of the upper mevalonate pathway (atoB, \nmvaS, and mvaA) in Bacillus subtilis to produce mevalonate. The three upper mevalonate pathway \ngenes have been successfully transformed in B. subtilis. Result for the expression was confirmed using \nSDS-PAGE and the mevalonate metabolites confirmation using GC-MS. From the SDS-PAGE result \nstained using coomassie blue dye, there were no apparent protein bands around the desired size of the \ntarget proteins (40.35 kDa for AtoB, 43.22 kDa for MvaS, and 46.18 kDa for MvaA). However, based on \nGC-MS measurement, mevalonate was present in the overexpression culture indicating the \nfunctionality and expression of the gene construct. Further optimization on the gene\u2019s expression \nwould be required to enhance mevalonate production in B. subtilis.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Audine Fathia Binanga": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/294211"}, "Penulis": "Audine Fathia Binanga [10719209]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. apt.
