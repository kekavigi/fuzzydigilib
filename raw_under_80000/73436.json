{"Nomor": 73436, "Judul": "A DETAILED RETROSPECTIVE STUDY ON THE COMPREHENSIVE PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF WELL AND RESERVOIR DATA FOR STEAM FLOODING IN THE XY AREA OF Z FIELD, INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "This study investigates the underperformance of the XY area in the Z field, which uses steam flooding as the primary\nmethod for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Despite its effectiveness, the XY area has experienced a significant\nproduction shortfall of approximately 30% compared to the target. The study utilizes a comprehensive method,\nincluding system efficiency assessment and statistical examination, to identify potential relevant factors. Using analog\nmethods and analyzing production data, the study classifies well regions, evaluates steam flood cycle maturity, and\nidentifies areas for well-intervention. The analysis reveals areas for improvement, including optimizing steam\ninjection strategies, and addressing inefficient steam injection and inadequate reservoir conditions. Based on these\nfindings, the study proposes specific recommendations to enhance steam flooding operations in the XY area. These\nrecommendations include increasing injection rates for immature wells, replacing and relocating pumps, and\nimplementing cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) or other stimulation methods. Implementing these strategies is expected\nto significantly improve production within the XY area, surpassing current levels. This study aims to optimize steam\nflooding operations and enhance oil recovery in the XY area by addressing the identified factors contributing to\nunderperformance and implementing targeted interventions. Further research and implementation are necessary to\nevaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of these recommendations in real-world field operations.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Aisy Khairunisa Bazilah": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/293380"}, "Penulis": "Aisy Khairunisa Bazilah [12219078]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Rani Kurnia, S.Si., M.T.", "Adli, ST, MBA."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "steam flooding, production shortfall, steam injection, recommendations", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Jun 2023"}
