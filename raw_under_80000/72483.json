{"Nomor": 72483, "Judul": "PREDICTION OF DIGGING FORCE USING ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK", "Abstrak": "Excavators are commonly used to excavate materials. Excavation occurs when the force offered by the excavator\nis greater than the force offered by the material. Tools that always receive high force from digging activity, will\nbe damaged faster. Therefore, we must calculate the forces acting on the tool. There are many ways that can be\nused to calculate the number of digging forces, one of which is using analytics. In this study, the digging force will\nbe calculated by looking at the change in strain on the tool and predicting it using the Artificial Neural Network\n(ANN) model. To determine the reaction to changes in strain and the load acting on the tool, vertical and horizontal\nloading tests were carried out. This test is carried out to determine the change in strain when the load is given.\nFrom the test results obtained, predictions using the ANN model have an R square of 92% for testing vertical loads\nand 96% for testing horizontal loads.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Muhammad Anggara Imam Tantowi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287253", "2022 MUHAMMAD ANGGARA IMAM TANTOWI 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287254", "2022 MUHAMMAD ANGGARA IMAM TANTOWI 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287255", "2022 MUHAMMAD ANGGARA IMAM TANTOWI 1-PAPER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287256"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Anggara Imam Tantowi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Nurhindro Priagung Widodo, Tri Karian, Yudhidya Wicaksana and Taufiqullah"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Mar 2023"}
