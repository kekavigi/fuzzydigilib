It is a segment of materialism, characterised by fast-paced and outsourced production, cost pressed profit structures, and never ending designs and trends. This framework that unremittingly stimulate new consumer wants have created a landscape of overconsumption. As an alternative to fast fashion concept, slow fashion has emerged as opposed to fast fashion to improve sustainability in the fashion industry. Based on the customer value creation framework, this study empirically examined structural models that can improve customer purchase intentions by determining the attributes that contribute to creating perceived customer value in Indonesia.
