{"Nomor": 72556, "Judul": "WELL TARGETING FOR GEOTHERMAL FIELD DEVELOPMENT BASED ON  INTEGRATION OF GRAVITY STUDY, GEOLOGY, AND RESERVOIR ANALYSIS IN  THE TMS FIELD, SULAWESI, INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "This paper presents the gravity study which integrated with the results of other studies, such as geology, \nreservoir, seismicity and geochemistry, in connection with the plan of development of geothermal power plant in the \nTMS field. Integration of these studies is aimed to identify the fault structure and geothermal prospect area, which could \nbe used then to review the placement of production and injection wells. The results show that the geothermal prospect \nareas is bounded by normal faults with N-S and NE-SW directions. In general, all proposed wells could be accepted \nwith some requirements. For production wells, the first and the second priority are well PN2 and PN3. While the third \npriority is well PN1 in which this well need to be placed close to the fault with the depth is slightly greater. All injection \nwells (I1, I2, I3 and I4) is located in the low residual anomaly and closed to the fault, so these wells have the same rank.", "Daftar File": {"Well Targeting for Geothermal Field Development based on.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/288478"}, "Penulis": "Susanti Alawiyah  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wawan Gunawan A.
