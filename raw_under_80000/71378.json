{"Nomor": 71378, "Judul": "EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF PIEZOELECTRIC MATERIAL IMPLEMENTATION AS SENSOR FOR MICROSATELLITE FLEXIBLE PANEL DYNAMIC RESPONSE", "Abstrak": "This thesis presents research on the structural dynamic characterization of a\nmicrosatellite\u2019s flexible panel equipped with a piezoelectric sensor. Various\ndynamic excitations could exert a microsatellite\u2019s flexible panel in space. In the\npresent work, a piezoelectric-based smart composite is implemented as a sensor to\nsense the panel's response due to dynamic excitation. Experimental work was\nconducted to evaluate the panel's response employing the piezoelectric sensor. In\nthe present case, the panel is modeled with a flexible plate. The dimensions of the\nflexible plate are designed such that it can represent the natural modes of a\nmicrosatellite panel. The disturbance exerted by the satellite's body motion is\ndefined as a base excitation employed via a shaker. A readily available piezoelectric\ncomposite in the market is used. The experimental results pointed out that the\npiezoelectric sensor is able to determine the natural frequencies of the plate's\nfundamental bending modes. The current results have been well validated with\nnumerical results from an electromechanical finite element model with less than 7%\nvariances in the resonance frequency values. An exciting finding is depicted as the\nexcitation amplitude increases, and the sensor is shown to have a limitation at a\nparticular maximum voltage value. Nevertheless, the present work shows that a\npiezoelectric composite in the market has the potential capability to use as a sensor\nwhile considering the dynamic characteristics only without observing another\nrequirement, such as environmental conditions.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Rizqy Agung": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/275722"}, "Penulis": "Rizqy Agung [23621018]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
