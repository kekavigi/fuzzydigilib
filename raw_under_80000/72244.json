{"Nomor": 72244, "Judul": "ONE FRAMEWORK TO RULE THEM ALL? CARRYING FORWARD THE CONVERSATION STARTED BY WISE AND SCHWARZ", "Abstrak": "In this brief squib, I take up the first of the provocations put forward by Wise and\nSchwarz in their recent article and make an attempt to spark further discussion. Specifically, I\nargue that instead of attempting to agree on an overarching, unified conceptual framework for\nCSCL from the top down, and rather than synthesizing findings from CSCL research from the\nbottom up, we could take a taxonomy of CSCL support dimensions as a starting point and\nengage in a concerted research effort with the aim of working towards a comprehensive\nframework of CSCL support. I therefore propose such a taxonomy, which currently comprises\n12 dimensions. By referring to some of my own research, I demonstrate how the proposed\nprocess of providing evidence-based design principles for CSCL support that cut across and\ninterleave the dimensions of the taxonomy could work.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Nikol Rummel", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": [], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Computer-supported collaborative learning .
