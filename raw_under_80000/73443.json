{"Nomor": 73443, "Judul": "SIMULATION STUDY OF ASPHALTE DEPOSITION IMPACT TO CCUS PROJECT: ANALYSIS ON CO2 INJECTION RATE AND RESISTANCE FACTOR EXPONENT EFFECT", "Abstrak": "The rapid increase in global CO2 emissions has prompted the adoption of effective measures to mitigate its adverse effects on human health and climate change. Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) has emerged as a promising solution, involving the separation, treatment, and storage or utilization of CO2. However, the injection of CO2 into reservoirs can lead to asphaltene deposition, which poses challenges to reservoir properties and potentially causes formation damage. Understanding asphaltene stability and dependency toward reservoir properties is essential for successful CCUS projects.\nIn this study investigated the impact of the resistance factor exponent and gas injection rate on asphaltene deposition and reservoir properties. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify relevant studies, theories, and models related to asphaltene deposition and its implications in CCUS projects. Additionally, reservoir simulation was performed using CMG software, incorporating geological and reservoir rock data and fluid properties.\nThe findings of the study demonstrated that the resistance factor exponent influenced asphaltene deposition and reservoir permeability. Furthermore, the gas injection rate directly affected reservoir properties, including oil recovery factor and carbon storage potential.\nUnderstanding the influence of the resistance factor exponent and gas injection rate on asphaltene deposition and reservoir properties enables effective mitigation of formation damage and enhancement of CO2 storage performance. These findings contribute to the overall goal of reducing CO2 emissions and ensuring environmental sustainability in the context of CCUS projects.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Iqbal Tri Wibitama": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/293402"}, "Penulis": "Iqbal Tri Wibitama [12219086]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
