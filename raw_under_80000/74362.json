Alkaline, Surfactant, Polymer, and their combinations were compared to select the best method. By using tNavigator software simulator, a total of 85 years forecast was done to simulate a total of 7 different scenarios. Properties affecting the performance such as adsorption, interfacial tension (IFT), capillary de-saturation, and viscosity multiplier were added to ensure mimic the field condition. Several parameters such as injection and production rate and chemical concentration were adjusted to the selected method. An economic calculation was also conducted as a consideration whether it is feasible to conduct the tertiary recovery stage.\nThe results of this study predict that Alkaline, Surfactant, Polymer (ASP) injection method, with a concentration of 3.5, 1.75, and 0.25 lb/stb respectively, result in 12.781 MMSTB oil recovered which is nearly 6% of incremental oil recovery with 6 months of injection. This result was better than other methods, hence ASP injection was optimized with an addition of 9 other scenarios. A total rate of 24000 STBD and a chemical composition of 10, 3, and 0.2 lb/stb, namely \u201cConc. 7\u201d case of ASP yields the most oil production with almost 9% of oil recovered. On the other hand, \u201cConc. 6\u201d case yields the highest profit with a value of 689 MMUSD. Therefore, this case was selected as the optimum method since it is feasible technically and economically.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Aliv Fadhli Baharuddin": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/296695"}, "Penulis": "Aliv Fadhli Baharuddin [12219061]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ivan Kurnia, S.T., M.Sc., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Chemical Enhanced Oil Recovery, Alkaline-Surfactant-Polymer Injection.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Jul 2023"}
