{"Nomor": 72245, "Judul": "COLLEGE READINESS VERSUS COLLEGE WORTHINESS: EXAMINING THE ROLE OF PRINCIPAL BELIEFS ON COLLEGE READINESS INITIATIVES IN AN URBAN U.S. HIGH SCHOOL", "Abstrak": "In light of increasing emphasis on the importance of post-secondary\neducation to personal economic security, there is growing interest to promote college\nreadiness initiatives in high schools, particularly for low-income and minority\nstudents for whom the harmful effects of institutional inequities on college readiness\nis well-documented. Relatively unexplored is whether and how deficit beliefs about\nthese students influence college readiness initiatives. Extant literature establishes\nthat principals play an important role in mediating organizational change and culture.\nHowever, there is scant research evaluating how principals\u2019 beliefs may\ninfluence their leadership towards reforming college readiness, particularly in regard\nto creating a college-going culture. This case study provides a critical examination\nof one principal who engaged in school-wide organizational change to create a\ncollege-going culture at an urban U.S. high school serving a high number of lowincome\nand minority students. Discourse analysis revealed that although this principal\u2019s\nreform efforts were exemplary in many ways, he expressed deficit views of\nunderrepresented students. Findings suggest that reductionist views of minority and\nlow-income students conflict with initiatives to promote equitable college readiness.\nThis case study uncovers a discursive dichotomy significant to examining the\nintersectionality of principals\u2019 beliefs and college readiness initiatives.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Christina Convertino", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ashley Graboski-Bauer"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "College readiness, Deficit model, Educator beliefs, Discourse analysis, Principals", "Sumber": "Springer", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Mar 2023"}
