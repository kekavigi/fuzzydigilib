{"Nomor": 72560, "Judul": "APPLICATION OF TIME LAPSE MICROGRAVITY METHOD  ON WATER INJECTION SIMULATION", "Abstrak": "Reservoir water injection is basically intended to increase the reservoir pressure, thus\nremain oil in the pore space of the reservoir rock is displaced by water and moves\ntoward production wells. When one fluid displaces, there are density changes caused \nby altering in fluid saturation and pressure. In the time lapse microgravity technique,\nthe density changes associated with water replacing oil can be detected with high \nresolution surface gravity measurements. \nThe main objective of this preliminary study is to identify front of water injection \nbased on density and saturation value resulted in numerical simulation. We apply \nnumerical approximation of two-phase immiscible and incompressible problems \nusing IMPES method in conjunction with time lapse microgravity formulation. The \nbasic method used is finite volume scheme to approach the pressure equation and \nfinite difference scheme to discretize the saturation and density equations. Simulation \nresults show that water front and concentration history of the displacing fluid can be \nidentified.", "Daftar File": {"APPLICATION OF TIME LAPSE MICROGRAVITY METHOD.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/288473"}, "Penulis": "Susanti Alawiyah [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wawan Gunawan A.
