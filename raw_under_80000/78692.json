{"Nomor": 78692, "Judul": "SERVICE DESIGN ON INTER-CITY TRANSPORTATION SERVICE", "Abstrak": "Bintang Prima is the fastest growing, inter-city transportation service available nowadays in the South Sulawesi. Founded by Edward Ridho and Hanna Wijaya, it is the first bus service in the area that put their concern in the comfort of their customer. What was started from a single, second-hand bus now has grown to have more than 40 busses spread around the region. But, with the growing market, there comes the challenge of having too much to handle. Based on observation and interview done with the owner, the research conclude that overwork is the result of ineffective work process that occurs within the company.\n\nTo overcome the problem, the business process is redesigned using Service Design Task. The Service Design Task is divided into 6 stages; SD Understanding, SD Thinking, SD Generating, SD Filtering, SD Explaining and SD Realizing. In each stage, a method is chosen. SD Understanding uses service blueprint and SERVQUAL analysis to understand the business process and customer\u2019s perspective. SD Thinking uses fishbone diagram to understand the root-cause. SD Generating uses Brainstorm to create alternatives. SD Filtering utilize PINC Filter as a way to cut down the alternatives. SD Explaining uses storyboard to paint the picture of the new process. Lastly, SD Realizing create new service blueprint out of the new process.\n\nFurther study on this research may include the real customer\u2019s application on the alternatives generated. It will also be beneficial to conduct financial analysis on the given alternatives and create a feasibility study.", "Daftar File": {"2015 SK PP Ivan Lilingpadang   [19012028] - Abstract": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/318745", "2015 SK PP Ivan Lilingpadang [19012028] - Chapter 1": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/318746", "2015 SK PP Ivan Lilingpadang [19012028] - Chapter 2": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/318747", "2015 SK PP Ivan Lilingpadang [19012028] - Chapter 3": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/318748", "2015 SK PP Ivan Lilingpadang [19012028] - Chapter 4": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/318749", "2015 SK PP Ivan Lilingpadang [19012028] - Chapter 5": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/318752", "2015 SK PP Ivan Lilingpadang [19012028] - References": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/318753", "2015 SK PP Ivan Lilingpadang [19012028] - Full Text.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/318754"}, "Penulis": "Ivan Lilingpadang [19012028]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Santi Novani, S.Si, M.T, Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "service design, inter-city transportation, transportation, transportation service, Sulawesi", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Abdul Aziz Ariarasa", "File": "8 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Nov 2023"}
