This can happen because there is a possibility that airline ticket prices are not optimal, also there is no synchronization of connecting flight schedules between Garuda Indonesia and its codeshare partner airlines, and the lack of network coverage of partner airlines. Therefore, this research aims to find optimum revenue for Garuda Indonesia, especially on the Jakarta - Tokyo - Jakarta route and analyse the codeshare schedule between Garuda Indonesia and the 2 largest airlines in Japan, which are All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines, as well as providing suggestion for Garuda Indonesia so that it can expand its route network in the Japan Domestic and North American Route sector through codeshare cooperation.\nThis research uses several formulas such as the formula for determining the Utility Value Function, Market Share Prediction, and also Revenue Estimation at Simulated Ticket Fare. This research use 2 methods in determining the optimum fare for maximizing the revenue for Garuda Indonesia, which are the Linear Regression and Multinomial Logit Model Regression. The Linear Regression is used to find the Utility Value Function to determine the coefficients of the airline that is analysed, which consist of Fare and Flight Frequency coefficients. The second method is the Multinomial Logit Model that is used to determine the Market Share Prediction to compare the market share of Garuda Indonesia and other airlines on the same route.\nIn addition, this research also analyse the flight schedules of Garuda Indonesia and its Japanese airline partners, which are Japan Airline Group and All Nippon Airways Group, so that they can offer routes to each other to carry out codeshare agreement for Indonesian Domestic routes, Japanese Domestic routes, and also North American routes, with the ultimate goal of providing recommendations for Garuda Indonesia regarding route expansion through codeshare cooperation to Domestic Japan and North American routes.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Calvin Francis Halim [13617104]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
