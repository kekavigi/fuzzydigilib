{"Nomor": 72620, "Judul": "BACTERIAL BIOLEACHING OF LOW GRADE NICKEL LIMONITE AND SAPROLITE ORES BY MIXOTROPHIC BACTERIA", "Abstrak": "Utilization of indigenous bacteria should be considered to establish a successful\nbiohydrometallurgical process. In this study, mixrotrophic iron-oxidizing bacterial\nconsortia consisting of Comamonas testosteroni, Alicyclobacillus ferrooxydans and\nPantoea septic which were isolated from Indonesian mineral ores were examined to\ndetermine their abilities to recover nickel from limonite and saprolite ores in the\nbioleaching experiments using stirred tank reactors. The nickel bioleaching\nexperiments inoculated with the bacterial consortia were carried out using coarse\nlimonite ores and weathered saprolite ores with pulp density of 10% w/v. Abiotic\ncontrols were also carried out replacing the inocula by the sterile medium. The\nbioleaching processes were monitored by measuring Ni and Fe contents and pH of the\nleaching solution as well as the total bacterial enzymatic activity measured as FDA\nhydrolytic activity. The effect of leaching on the mineralogy of laterite ores was\ninvestigated by the scanning electron microscope equipped with energy-dispersive\nspectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). After 28 days of\nincubation, the FDA hydrolytic activity was observed in both bioleaching experiments\ncontaining limonite (17.2 ????g fluorescein/mL) and saprolite ores (16.9 ????g\nfluorescein/mL). The leached Ni and Fe in the bioleaching experiments containing\nlimonite ores (30% Ni and 5.6% Fe) was greater than that in abiotic controls (1% Ni and\n0.1% Fe) with the pH range of 2.5 to 3.5. However, the bacterial consortia were less\ncapable of bioleaching of Ni (2.5%) with the similar leached Fe (6%) from the saprolite\nores. In abiotic controls, the medium pH remained relatively constant (pH 6). It was\nconcluded that these bacterial isolated as the consortium were capable of nickel\nbioleaching (precious metal) more effectively than iron (gangue metal),\napplicable to the commercial processing of the difficult-to-process low-grade nickel\nlaterite ores in Indonesia.", "Daftar File": {"2016 SITI KHODIJAH CHAERUN 1-PAPER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289757"}, "Penulis": "Siti Khodijah Chaerun [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Siti Aisyah Alting, Mohammad Zaki Mubarok and Edy Sanwani"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Mineral bioprocessing, Bioleaching, Sulfide mineral ores, Mixotrophic bacteria", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani \u00a0\n                                     Resti Andriani", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Mei 2023"}
