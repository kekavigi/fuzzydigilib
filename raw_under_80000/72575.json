The study areas took place\naround M7.8 in 1994 and M7.7 in 2006. The change of the b-value is estimated using the maximum likelihood method\nwith a constant number. First, the b-value surrounding the center area of interest with a radius of about 150 km is\ncalculated based on the earthquake catalog data from 1963 to 2016 (b50). Second, the b-value based on five years with a\none-year moving window (b5) is estimated before M7.8 in 1994 and M7.7 in 2006. The b5 is calculated based on the\nconstant number of events of 25, 50, 75, and 100, and we evaluate the mean b-value. Furthermore, the SHF of b50 and b5\nare calculated, and then they are compared. The results showed that the Probability of Exceedance (PE) of SHF b5\nincreased by about five years before the two large earthquake events. Therefore, the results obtained in this study might\nbe very beneficial for earthquake mitigation and modeling efforts for the possible potential of the earthquake hazard study\nand future analysis.", "Daftar File": {"WTY - SEISMIC HAZARD FUNCTION (SHF) STUDY PRIOR TO LARGE EARTHQUAKE.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/288678"}, "Penulis": "Wahyu Triyoso [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Osa Yuninda"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Seismic Hazard Function, b-value, Probability of Exceedance, Large Earthquake, Mitigation.", "Sumber": "-", "Staf Input/Edit": "Devi Septia Nurul", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Apr 2023"}
