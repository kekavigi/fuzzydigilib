Despite the body\u2019s natural healing power, there are several diseases that it can\u2019t heal and among them is large bone defect caused by cancer tumors, infections, open fractures, and other congenital anomalies. At present, Autogenous bone grafts are still considered to be the \u201cgold standard\u201d due to its structural stability and zero risk of disease transmission/ infection. However, this technique still proves to be a challenge due to several complications, such as complex preparation technique, additional surgical procedures, and irregular geometries in each case. There has been plenty exploration on alternatives and one of them is 3D-printed scaffolds using PLA/HA as materials. Using three-dimensional printing, these scaffolds can be easily customized which made this method highly desirable for bone tissue engineering.\nIn this study, mechanical properties and characteristics of FDM 3D-printed PLA specimen with various lattice or porous structure, including rectangular, triangular, gyroid, and 3D honeycomb pattern and injection molded PLA/HA specimen with customized HA ratio of 0%, 10%, 20%, 30% HA will be evaluated. The results shows that rectangular pattern with 70& infill density exhibit the most suitable mechanical properties and characteristic to be used for bone scaffolding as it can withstand high bending and compressive load while also can undergo a significantly more amount of plastic deformation compared to the four other patterns. It has also been proven that adding HA into the scaffold will make the scaffold more brittle and as the HA ratio increases, the mechanical strength of the specimen also significantly decreases for all experiments, including bending, compression, and tensile strength.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Kiyomi Andriani Putri [13119098]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
