{"Nomor": 78566, "Judul": "DEVELOPING CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF DESIGN-DRIVEN INNOVATION PRACTICES IN INDONESIA:  CASE STUDIES OF DESIGNPRENEUR-LED CREATIVE COMPANIES", "Abstrak": "Design driven innovation has emerged to be an alternative way to generate sustainable competitive products or services. Previous research has recently revealed successful practices of design driven innovation in various industries. However, the strong focus of  recent literature on user-centered design has left a major empty spot in theory of product innovation management in understanding how breakthrough innovations driven by design  or innovation driven by meaning, are created. In addition to that, no research done yet so far, on how design-driven are carried out in Indonesia case especially in creative industries.\n\nThis research investigates the existence and practices of design-driven innovation in the Indonesian context.  The main objective of this research is to develop a design-driven innovation process conceptual model describing the leading and positive role of design in the process of radical innovation of product meaning, practicing by the Indonesian designpreneur-led creative industry.\n\nThis research is based on 2-stage qualitative multiple-case study approach which consist of exploratory case study research followed by explanatory case study. The exploratory case study is done by first consulting with two experts in the design field to familiarize with the topic, then followed by in-depth interview with two experienced designpreneurs and analyzing the data with the cycle of coding, resulting a verified DDI conceptual model consists of a set of key processes, such as sensing, sensemaking, signmaking, shaping and storytelling. In the next explanatory multiple case study  stage,  the emerging conceptual model is to be confirmed with a sample of four successful designpreneur-led creative industry. By collecting data through semis-structured interview , documents and observation and analyzing it through within and cross case analysis, resulting that in general, all the four studied designpreneurs has been practicing design-driven innovation in developing their product or service and  enjoying the benefits of high-value creating capability of the approach, the 5 key processes  is generally confirmed  or exist in each of the 4 case studies, but with some differencies mainly about the existence of key interpreter(s) and design discourse. \n\nThe contribution of this research is that it has revealed that to deliver a new meaning successfully to the market, at least for the designpreneur-led creative industry, there are ways other than actively immerse in a design discourse and to actively engage with key interpreters as defined in theoretical review. Second finding shows that the source of ideas for developing a new meaning comes from various data gathering techniques such as:  bodystorming, brainstorming, design discourse, culture code, imperience, in-depth interview and lifestyle study, while according to a literature review, the source of ideas for new meaning creation is gained mostly through interacting with interpreters in a design discourse. The third finding shows that instead of through special interpreters, a storyline  is developed as a way to evoke the emotion of prospective customers so that the new radical meaning can reside in their minds.\n\nFrom the practical point of view, the verified conceptual model of Design Driven Innovation could be translated into a practical guidelines in helping any young designer who has a strong passion to become a successful designpreneur and it can also be translated into a proposal for leveraging the Bandung Creative City to become a Design-Driven City as well, by developing the capabilities in the radical innovation of meaning both in products as well as services in order to build a sustainable competitive output of Bandung Creative City in the future.\n\nThere are several interested research direction could be followed up from this research, among others: research on the possibility of integrating design driven approach and business model  approach, applying  design driven innovation strategy for any businesses outside the realm of the creative industry. From research methodology point of view applying Grounded Theory, Etthnography, Phenomenology or Semiotics Methodology should be worthed to pursue to opening up  a new perspectives on Design Driven Innovation.", "Daftar File": {"2014 DS PP Pennoh Philips Kembaren   [39009004] - Full Text.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/316839", "2014 DS PP Pennoh Philips Kembaren   [39009004] - Abstract.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/316843", "2014 DS PP Pennoh Philips Kembaren   [39009004] - List of Contents.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/316844", "2014 DS PP Pennoh Philips Kembaren   [39009004] - Chapter 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/316845", "2014 DS PP Pennoh Philips Kembaren   [39009004] - Chapter 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/316846", "2014 DS PP Pennoh Philips Kembaren   [39009004] - Chapter 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/316847", "2014 DS PP Pennoh Philips Kembaren   [39009004] - Chapter 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/316848", "2014 DS PP Pennoh Philips Kembaren   [39009004] - Chapter 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/316849", "2014 DS PP Pennoh Philips Kembaren   [39009004] - Chapter 6.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/316850", "2014 DS PP Pennoh Philips Kembaren   [39009004] - References.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/316851", "2014 DS PP Pennoh Philips Kembaren   [39009004] - Appendix.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/316852"}, "Penulis": "Pennoh Philips Kembaren [39009004]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
