These basis functions are constructed through the\nconvolution of piecewise polynomials defined within cells and a selected smooth\nkernel or mollifier. The mollifier is chosen to be smooth, have compact support,\nand possess a unit volume. The resulting properties of the basis functions\nare governed by the smoothness of the mollifier and the local polynomial\napproximation order.\nSince mollified basis functions have arbitrary high order, smoothness, and\navailable to set arbitrary polynomial order in each cells, The local refinement\nbecomes one way to improve the efficiency of mollified collocation method, two\nof them are p-adaptivity which can be analyzed by setting different polynomial\norder in one simulation and h-refinement. The h-refinement study begins\nwith the regularisation of Voronoi diagram using Lloyds algorithm. Also, the\neffect of p-adaptivity will be analyzed by evaluating the convergence error in\nsimulating linear elasticity plate with hole problem.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Syahrir Ginanjar [13619032]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
