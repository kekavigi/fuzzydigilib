{"Nomor": 75466, "Judul": "EVOLUSI STRUKTUR JARINGAN PENERBANGAN DI INDONESIA DALAM SUDUT PANDANG TOPOLOGI", "Abstrak": "As the world's largest archipelagic nation, Indonesia considers aviation a crucial\ntransportation mode for connecting its vast territories. However, there is still room\nfor improvement in understanding the topology structure of the Indonesian Air\nTransport Network. It emphasizes the importance of comprehensive studies that\nanalyze the structural evolution of the Indonesian Air Transport Network. By\nexamining the network as a complex system, this research offers a fresh perspective\nthat captures its topology and explores its various properties. Also, concerns about\nthe air transportation network's scalability and capacity to accommodate future\ndemand have led to a comprehensive analysis of its topological features. This\nresearch aims to validate whether the network can fulfill the traffic demand by\nevaluating the network's scalability. The analysis focuses on the period from 2018\nto 2022, providing a detailed investigation and understanding of the evolving\nstructure of the Indonesian Air Transport Network. This analysis provides insights\ninto its structure, centrality, scalability, and impact on the economic sector, thereby\ncontributing to the development and optimization of Indonesia's air transportation\nsystem.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ulya Firdausi Rabbaniyyah [13619011]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Taufiq Mulyanto, S.T.", "Dr. -Ing.
