{"Nomor": 72586, "Judul": "EVALUATION OF OXYGEN BEHAVIOR IN OVERBURDEN DUMPING AREA: A FIELD MEASUREMENT STUDY COMPARING POTENTIALLY ACID FORMING AND NON-ACID FORMING ROCK", "Abstrak": "Sulfide mineral oxidation within coal-bearing rock is fundamental reaction that determines acid mine drainage\n(AMD) generation in the coal mine. Pyrite, as a prominent sulfide mineral due to its reactivity and abundance, is\neasily exposed in the overburden dumping area which causes this area becomes the great source of AMD\npollution in mine site after the oxidation takes place. In order to reduce AMD generation, numerous prevention\nmethods are studied and applied in the overburden dumping area by cutting off one or both of the reactanis:\noxygen and water. Prevalent prevention method in the coal mine site is dry cover technigue that segregate the\npotentially acid forming (PAF) and non-acid forming (NAF) rock, then encapsulate PAF underneath NAF\ntherefore minimize infiltration of reactanis.\n\nOxygen plays important role for efficiency of dry cover technigue in overburden dumping. As the result, its\nbehavior is widely studied to understand reaction process that happen in this area thus obtain the most effective\nprevention for AMD. This research aims to evaluate oxygen behavior of dry cover, in both PAF and NAF layer,\nfor understanding the effect of sulfide oxidation and oxygen consumption rate. Two different depths of one drill\nhole for each PAF and NAF rock layer were investigated. Oxygen and moisture then were measured Jor around\n24 hours. Static tests for acid producing capacity (Total Sulfur test, Acid Neutralizing Capacity test and Net Acid\nGenerating test) were carried out to investigate the correlation of sulfide oxidation and oxygen consumption in\nthe field.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Sendy Dwiki": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289131", "2016 SENDY DWIKI 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289132", "2016 SENDY DWIKI 1-PAPER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289133"}, "Penulis": "Sendy Dwiki [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hideki Shimada,, Rudy S.
