{"Nomor": 77843, "Judul": "FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS ON LOW VELOCITY IMPACT AND COMPRESSION AFTER IMPACT OF COMPOSITE LAMINATE", "Abstrak": "The usage of composite material have been increasing the last decades, especially\nin industries such as aerospace and automotive. However, one of the\nconcerns regarding the usage of composite is its susceptibility to damage due\nto low velocity impact (LVI). LVI can cause a barely visible impact damage\n(BVID) which can compromise the compression strength significantly. In\nthis reseach, finite element method (FEM) models based on Kirchoff\u2019s Plate\nTheory, Hashin-Rottem damage modelling, and Benzggagh-Kenane fracture\ncriterion are proposed to simulate the low velocity impact and compression\nafter impact (CAI) on composite laminate. The models are modelled and validated\nwith existing experiment data. The FEM model is used to find the\nrelationship between the impact energy and laminate orientations on the CAI\nstrength. The developed model could predict the composite behaviour considerably\nwell. The LVI impact energy is found to have an inverse power law\nrelationship with the CAI strength. The laminates with more 0 degree plies\ntends to have higher compression strength while laminate with \u00b145 tends to\nhave better damage resistance.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Enrico Samuel Rusli": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/308920"}, "Penulis": "Enrico Samuel Rusli [23622020]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
