{"Nomor": 72593, "Judul": "PERFORMANCE OF OPEN FLY ASH CHANNEL: RESULT OF LABORATORY STUDY", "Abstrak": "Fly ash is utilized as the main neutralizing material for acid mine drainage (AMD) treatment by using an open Aly\nash channel method. This study was carried out with 2 scenarios of acidic water content as independent variables\n(Channel 1: distilled water \u00bb H2SOzs and Channel 2: distilled water \u00bb H2SO4 \u00ab Fe). Measurement is carried out\nto the 500 ml water sample at the outlet of the channel. The result shows efficiency level of pH neutralization is\n124.690 and 81.879o for Channel 1 and Channel 2, respectively. Leachate Channel 1 shows a decrease in pH (9.84\nt0 3.05 after 1,608 hours), while Channel 2 shows a decrease in pH (9.38 10 2.87 after 1, 104 hours). Precipitation\nof iron hydroxide and gypsum seems to affect the channel efficiency because it causes porosity and permeability\nof the channel to decrease by covering the surface layer on the fly ash so that the neutralization process becomes\nless effective.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Sendy Dwiki": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289243", "2019 SENDY DWIKI 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289244", "2019 SENDY DWIKI 1-PAPER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289245"}, "Penulis": "Sendy Dwiki [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ginting Jalu Kusuma, M.
