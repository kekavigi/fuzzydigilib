{"Nomor": 73486, "Judul": "UTILIZING ESP REDESIGN AND GRAVEL PACK IMPLEMENTATION TO ENHANCE PRODUCTION RATES AND LIFESPAN IN EXTREME WELL", "Abstrak": "Oil well production gradually declines over time due to various issues, necessitating the implementation of artificial lifting methods to sustain or enhance production rates. In this study, Electrical Submersible Pump (ESP) was chosen as the artificial lift method. The research focuses on Field X, located in Jambi, which is a mature/brown field characterized by sand as the dominant rock and fluid property.\nSpecifically, the analysis centers around Well X-025 within Field X, extreme well, which experiences challenges such as high water cut, sanding issues, and mechanical downhole problems, leading to a substantial disparity between gross and net production. To improve production rates, a re-design of the existing ESP system was conducted, incorporating the determination of a design production rate in accordance with rule of thumb guidelines.\nFurthermore, sensitivity analysis was carried out on the identified parameters. In the quest to extend the lifespan of the ESP well, alternative methods were explored, and the implementation of a gravel pack emerged as a solution to address the electrical downhole problems (MDHP) related to sand.\nThe results of the re-design revealed that for Well X-025, employing 74 stages, a frequency of 60 Hz, and PMM,a NHV (790-1000)H was achieved, leading to an increased flowrate of 469 BFPD (Barrels of Fluid per Day) with an efficiency of 56%. It is important to note that the presence of skin caused by the gravel pack leads to a reduction in the well's production rate, potentially prolonging the lifespan of the sanded well.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Aurelia Agustina": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/293463"}, "Penulis": "Aurelia Agustina [12219036]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wijoyo Niti Daton, S.T, M.T.", "Prasandi Abdul Aziz, S.Si., M.T.", "Yudha Yulianto, S.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "ESP, Sand, Production Rate, Skin, Gravel Pack", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Jun 2023"}
