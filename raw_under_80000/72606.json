This narrow vein cannot be mined by using mechanized cut and fill mining method. Other methods which are resuing or shrinkage stoping underground mining method will be developed to mine these narrow veins. Technical design parameters for each proposed mining method based on the field data. Its consists of opening width, blasting pattern, supporting system, productivity, and break even cut of grade. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages based on the technical analysis. As result, resuing method will produce cleaner are and higher COG, however need more support materials and explosives.", "Daftar File": {"2016 BUDI SULISTIANTO 1-PAPER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289404", "COVER Budi Slistianto": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289405", "2016 BUDI SULISTIANTO 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289406"}, "Penulis": "Budi Sulistianto [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Firly R Baskoro, Tri Karian, Anzhari Wadiyan, Eko Sunarso, M.
