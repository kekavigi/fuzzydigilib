Big Data has the potential to boost numerous industries, including production, service, and catastrophe management. This research was done to determine the challenges and how Big Data contributes to the advancement of disaster management-related studies. This study aims to determine how Big Data improves the humanitarian response chain in disaster management. For this study, 31 articles that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were examined and analyzed using a systematic literature review methodology utilizing journal articles including data from the Web of Science. Several components of the Humanitarian Relief Chain are assisted using Big Data, according to the findings of this study. The conclusion of the study is that implementing Big Data has 8 Challenges: environment, lack of data expert, coordination and collaboration, data collection and quailty, management, data security, IT technologoy, and political and administration issue.
