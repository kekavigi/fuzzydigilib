{"Nomor": 72870, "Judul": "RAPID 3D QUALITY CONTROL IN PREFABRICATION USING A 3D DIGITAL-TEMPLATES FRAMEWORK", "Abstrak": "With increased prefabrication in the construction industry, fabrication workers are tasked to assemble more complicated\nassemblies with tighter tolerances. However, the existing measurement tools and processes have not changed to accommodate this shift.\nLack of advanced measurement tools and existing processes results in increased risk of late detection of geometric errors. To reduce these\nrisks, three-dimensional (3D) quality control systems leveraging scan-vs-BIM methods can be adopted as part of the fabrication process.\nHowever, these systems have not been widely adopted yet by fabrication shops, because: (1) fabrication shops often do not have 3D models\ncorresponding to shop drawings; and (2) the cost of integrating accurate 3D scanning equipment into fabrication workflows is assumed to be\ntoo high. To remove the first barrier, in this article, a framework for developing 3D digital templates is developed for inspecting received parts.\nThe framework is used for developing a library of 600 3D-models of piping parts. The library is leveraged to deploy a 3D quality control\nsystem that was then tested in an industrial scale case study. The results of the case study are used to develop a discrete event simulation\nmodel. The simulation results from the model and subsequent cost benefit analysis show that investment in integrating the scan-vs-3D-model\nquality control systems can have significant cost savings and provide a payback period of less than two years.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mohammad Mahdi Sharif", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Steven Chuo, Carl T.
