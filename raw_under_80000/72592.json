{"Nomor": 72592, "Judul": "OVERBURDEN DUMP STABILITY IN COAL OPEN PIT MINE WITH WEAK COAL-BEARING STRATA", "Abstrak": "Stability of overburden dump in coal open pit mine needs to be maintained during the mining operation.\nOverburden dump failure will lead to severe loss, such as damage to eguipment and facilities or even casualty. It\nwill also cause a long term effect on production, such as shortage space for dumping operation, longer hauling E\ndistance or even coal reserve loss. The challenge of maintaining overburden dump stability is even more difficult\nJSor coal mines with a relatively young age of coal-bearing strata and high intensity of rainfall, such as coal mines\nin Indonesia. This paper highlights the challenges that occur for overburden dumping operation in Indonesian 1\ncoal mines. Case studies from several coal mines in Indonesia are taken. The causes of failure, analysis, and\ncountermeasures will be highlighted to give a comprehensive understanding of overburden dump stability in coal\nopen pit mine with weak coal-bearing strata.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Tri Karian": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289240", "2019 TRI KARIAN 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289241", "2019 TRI KARIAN 1-PAPER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289242"}, "Penulis": "Tri Karian [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Budi Sulistianto and Ginting Jalu Kusuma"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Teknik Pertambangan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani \u00a0\n                                     Resti Andriani", "File": "3 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Apr 2023"}
