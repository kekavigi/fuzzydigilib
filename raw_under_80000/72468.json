{"Nomor": 72468, "Judul": "GEOTHERMAL EXPLORATION USING GRAVITY METHOD: CASE STUDY OF WAY UMPU GEOTHERMAL PROSPECTIVE AREA, LAMPUNG PROVINCE, INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "Gravity method is a geophysical method that can be used to determine the subsurface\nstructure of prospecting area in a geothermal exploration. The gravity method exploration\nsteps; data acquisition, subsurface modelling, and model interpretation; was performed to\nexplore the possibilities of geothermal prospect using gravity method in WayUmpu\nGeothermal Prospective Area, Lampung Province, Indonesia. All of those exploration\nsteps were done with consideration of geological data on survey area as the main\nreference. The steps obtained in this survey were data acquisition; data quality analysis;\ncalculation of complete Bouguer anomaly; subsurface modeling; along with interpretation\nof the modeling results with geological data as supporting data Final result of gravity\nmodelling at Mount Remas and it surroundings in WayUmpu prospecting area concludes\nthat Mount Remas is a heat source of the geothermal system in this area. Besides that,\nthere are some fault structures that predicted to form reservoir zone in this geothermal\nsystem, with WayUmpu Fault as the main control of this area. On deciding on the\ngeothermal prospect area, the northwest area of Mount Remas is predicted as the prospect\narea that confirmed by geothermal manifestations like hot springs that concentrated at the\nnorthwest area and the position of WayUmpu Fault that predicted connect Mount Remas\nand hot springs.", "Daftar File": {"WWP - Geothermal Exploration Using Gravity Method.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/286815"}, "Penulis": "Apulina Priska [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Darharta Dahrin, Widodo, Wahyudi W.
