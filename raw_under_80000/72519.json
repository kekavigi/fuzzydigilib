As we know very well, measurement\nusing relative gravimeters in oil / gas / geothermal\nfields has less accuracy compared to laboratory\nmeasurements. We have to set a high regulation of\nquality control of our time-lapse microgravity data\nacquisitions in order to get accurate response from\nsubsurface sources. Values of time-lapse microgravity\nanomaly are relatively small, in ?Gal order. Therefore,\nthe time-lapse microgravity data acquisition should be\nset up for this order of anomaly target. The first\nacquisition of time-lapse microgravity data becomes\nour baseline map. So for the next acquisition, we have\nto do exactly the same things as we did in the first\nacquisition. In this paper, we describe the several steps\nof quality control for the 2011 microgravity data\nacquisition using a relative gravimeter (Scintrex CG-5)\nover the Wayang Windu geothermal field, West Java,\nIndonesia. These steps involve consistency of\ngravimeters, tidal correction using base observation,\ndrift correction (less than 35 ?Gal), repeatability check\nin the same station with different loops (less than 10\n?Gal), derive our time-lapse maps using 10 ?Gal\ncontour interval, and considering different levels of\ngravimeter tripods. Finally, we present the application\nof 2008-2011 time-lapse microgravity in order to\nunderstand geothermal reservoir behavior. After going\nthrough the calculation of time-lapse microgravity\nanomaly, we apply several methods of gravity\nmodeling (estimating the distribution of density\ncontrast changes, estimating the apparent saturation,\n2.5D forward gravity modeling, and 3D inverse gravity\nmodeling) to draw our interpretation. These results\ngive a good agreement with the previous and others\nstudies. Time-lapse microgravity results led us to a\nmore comprehensive understanding of geothermal\nreservoir behavior relating to injection and production\nprocesses, fault delineation and its behavior to fluid\nmovement (complemented with the other study\nresults).", "Daftar File": {"COVER Setianingsih": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287868", "2011 SETIANINGSIH 1-PAPER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287878"}, "Penulis": "Setianingsih [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Eko J.
