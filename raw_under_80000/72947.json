{"Nomor": 72947, "Judul": "NON-LINEAR INVERSION STUDY FOR LONG GROUNDED WIRE TDEM DATA", "Abstrak": "Time domain electromagnetic method (TDEM) is a geophysical method that can be applied to a wide range of\nproblem. TDEM data requires non-linear inversion in its modelling because of the complex relationship between\ndata and model. Previous studies proved that one type of inversion method will not give the most satisfactory\nresults for all different types of inversion problems. For this reason, this study was conducted to discuss the\nperformance of global non-linear inversion methods for 1D TDEM data modelling so that future inversion process\ncan be carried out more optimally. In this study, the performance of VFSA (very fast simulated annelaing) and\nMPSO (modified particle swarm optimization) inversion method in the modelling of synthetic and field 1D TDEM\ndata is compared. The inversion modelling is done multiple times in order to consider the random factor present\nin both methods and also to compare the result\u2019s variability of each method. From the result of synthetic data\ninversion, it can be seen that there is a variation of inversion performance between models which is caused by the\nambiguity in 1D TDEM. Based on the comparison of the two methods, MPSO performs better in inversion of data\nwith lower level of ambiguity, and vice versa. Overall, it is concluded that the VFSA method performs better than\nMPSO because it has lower variability and gives better inversion results for data with high ambiguity which is\nusually the case for real 1D TDEM data.", "Daftar File": {"Non-linear inversion study for long grounded wire TDEM Data.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/292273"}, "Penulis": "Dr. Warsa [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Rai Sudha Prabawa"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "TDEM data", "Sumber": "-", "Staf Input/Edit": "Devi Septia Nurul", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Jun 2023"}
