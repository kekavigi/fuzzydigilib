{"Nomor": 72234, "Judul": "ADEQUACY IN EDUCATION AND NORMATIVE SCHOOL CHOICE", "Abstrak": "In this paper I make a contribution to three distinct, but deeply interwoven\nsubjects. Firstly, I argue that, at the level of ideal theory, the distribution of educational\ngoods should follow a sufficientarian pattern and that the evaluative space of children\u2019s\nadvantage should be inspired by the capability approach (although with an important\ntwist). Secondly, the paper is delving into the more policy-oriented debates on the desirability\nof school choice. I argue that, given the non-ideal circumstances in which decision\nmakers have to act, giving parents the opportunity to choose the school for their children is\na sine qua non condition for even approaching the ideals of sufficientarian justice. Lastly, I\nmove the discussion on more empirical grounds, advancing a criticism of the Romanian\neducational legislation. I argue that the sufficiency-constrained school choice system that I\nenvision could solve some of the problems that the Romanian educational system faces\ntoday.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Adelin Costin Dumitru [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Adequacy, Capability approach, Parental rights, School choice, Romanian educational system", "Sumber": "Springer", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Mar 2023"}
