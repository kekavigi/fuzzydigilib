Partial discharge (PD) activity in power apparatus is an indication of\ninsulation degradation due to the presence of defects in the insulation. Partial discharges are\nionization processes that take place in voids filled with gas or oil inside the insulation, in dielectric\nsurfaces, and in the proximity of sharp metallic objects.\nDetection and measurement of partial discharge at the early stage serves as the predictive and\npreventive maintenance of high voltage equipment in order to anticipate the imminent failure of\nthe power equipment and unplanned power outage.\nThe occurrence of partial discharge on power equipment can be directly an indication of problems\nin the insulation, but they can also be the consequence of other degradation processes of the\ninsulation. Wide range of detectors including inductive, capacitive, acoustic, and light sensors are\nused to measure partial discharges. Since the partial discharges occur in extremely short times,\nusually in the range of nanoseconds, the radiofrequency measurement of the phenomenon in the\nHF, VHF, and UHF bands is also part of the unconventional methods used for PD detection.\nElectromagnetic (EM) sensors such as antennas are used for PD measurement due to their ability\nto perform a complete study on PD measurement such as ability to detect PD pulses, PD\nlocalization site, and, to some extent, ability to classify the type of partial discharge online.\nThe Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) method has been an accurate diagnostic technique for many\nyears, which is applied to determine the condition and quality of the insulation system in high\nvoltage (HV) equipements such as power transformer, power generator, electric motor, power\ncables and gas insulated substation (GIS). Conventional method and nonconventional methods are\nused to detect PD in high voltage power apparatus by means of PD sensors. A power transformer\nas one of the high voltage equipment used for power transmission and power distribution among\nthe most expensive high voltage power apparatus in electric power systems. The breakdown of\nhigh voltage power transformer can cause significant losses for power utilities as well as blackouts\nfor customers. The survey by CIGRE working group (WG A2.37) conducted on 964 high-voltage\npower transformers population in 2015 revealed that the weak point of most of power transformers\nlies in its windings. The most dominant failure causes of the transformer is related to dielectric\nproblem, which is associated to the aging of the paper-oil insulation system. To prevent the\n\n3\n\npremature failure and aging of power transformers, the power transformers need to be routinely\nobserved, tested, and diagnosed.\nTo ensure safe and reliable operation of the power transformer, a PD monitoring system is needed\nin order to assess the condition of the transformer insulation and to schedule the maintenance and\nrepair plans in the early stage before the breakdown of the transformers. To detect partial discharge\nonline when the transformer is still in service, it requires more sensitive sensors which operate in\nultra-high frequency (UHF) range in order to detect the UHF PD signals emitted from the inside\nof power transformer tank .\nRecently, many researches have been conducted about designing sensors for PD detection on\npower transformers. However, according to the literature review, some of the sensors that were\ndesigned previously still have some limitations such as low sensitivity to PD signals and a small\nbandwidth. Moreover, in previous researches about PD sensors design, some PD sensors were not\nimplemented on the actual power transformer in real conditions. Some of the previously designed\nPD sensors were only tested for PD detection on transformer models, by using a metallic box filled\nwith oil and artificial insulation defects that were located inside the metal box to simulate PD\nsource inside the power transformer.\nThe proposed research in this dissertation aims at designing and implementing the microstrip patch\nantennae with ultra-wide band characteristics (UWB) operating in the UHF range of 300MHz -\n3GHz in order to detect the PD induced electromagnetic signals emitted from the complex\ninsulation system inside the transformer tank. The designed UHF antennas were tested first by\nusing the vector network analyzer (VNA) to measure some basic antenna parameters such as return\nloss (S11 parameter), VSWR, bandwidth, resonance frequency and input impedance. Later on, the\ndesigned UHF antennas were implemented in detecting and locating the partial discharge on power\ntransformer model in high voltage laboratory.\nIn the first phase of this research, the UHF antennas with UWB characteristics namely, circular\nmicrostrip patch antenna and rectangular microstrip patch antenna were designed, simulated and\noptimized to have optimal parameters such as ultra-wide bandwidth characteristics, lower return\nloss under -10dB, lower VSWR less than 2, higher gain and directivity. The proposed UHF\nantennas were designed, simulated and optimized using the CST Microwave Studio Software and\nHFSS Software. After designing the antennas, the next step was to fabricate the proposed UHF\nantennas and these antennas were fabricated on the printed circuit board (PCB) with FR-4 Epoxy\nsubstrate. The optimal designs of the proposed circular microstrip patch antenna and rectangular\nmicrostrip patch antenna have a bandwidth of 3.3GHz and 1.24GHz, respectively. Both designed\ncircular and rectangular microstrip antennas have a lower return loss (below-10dB) at all resonance\nfrequencies, lower VSWR less than 2, and an ultra-wide bandwidth (UWB) characteristic.\nIn the second phase of this research dissertation, to investigate the detection sensitivity\n\nperformance, the designed antennas were implemented preliminarily for PD detection in air-\ninsulated systems before being applied for PD detection in oil-insulated systems such as on power\n\ntransformers. The fabricated UHF antennas with UWB characteristics were implemented to detect\nPD in air insulation by using two types of insulation defects namely, needle-plate electrode model\nand plate-plate electrode model to generate corona discharge and surface discharge, respectively\n\n4\n\nin air insulation. Based on PD measurement results obtained by using the designed UHF antennas,\nit was investigate that these antennas have high sensitivity to detect PD activity in air-insulated\nsystems.\nIn the third phase of the research, the designed UHF antennas having UWB characteristics were\nimplemented for partial discharge detection in transformer oil insulation through laboratory\nexperiments by using the needle-plate electrode model, used as an artificial insulation defect to\ngenerate corona discharge in oil insulation. In the laboratory experiments conducted in this\nresearch phase, four applied voltage levels namely, 10kV, 12kV, 14kV and 16kV were used to\ninvestigate the effect of the applied voltage to the partial discharge features. To evaluate the\nsensitivity performance of the designed UHF antennas in detecting PD pulses, four antenna\npositions namely, 50cm, 70cm, 100cm and 200cm were used and varied respectively in the\nexperiment. Based on PD measurement results obtained by using the designed UHF antennas, it\nwas investigated that the designed antenna has a high sensitivity to detect the PD-induced\nelectromagnetic waves originating from the PD source in oil even when the antennas are positioned\nat a distance of 2m from the PD source. To validate the PD measurement results obtained by using\nthe designed antennas, these antennas were used to detect PD pulse signals simultaneously with\nthe commercial HFCT sensor used as a comparison PD sensor.\nThe fourth phase of research dissertation has focused on the implementation of the designed UHF\nantennas (rectangular microstrip antenna and circular microstrip antenna) for partial discharge\ndetection through laboratory experiments on the oil-filled transformer tank model. Two types of\ninsulation defects namely; the needle-plate electrode model and plate-plate electrode model were\nused as artificial insulation defects to generate corona discharge and surface discharge in oil\ninsulation. The oil-filled metal tank model having a dimension of 50cm x 50cm x 50cm was used\nto simulate an actual oil-immersed power transformer. The thickness of the metal tank wall is 5mm\nwas used to simulate the power transformer. In the laboratory experiments conducted in this last\nphase of research dissertation, four applied voltage levels namely, 10kV, 12kV, 14kV and 16kV\nwere used to investigate the effect of the applied voltage to the detected partial discharge features.\nTo evaluate the sensitivity performance of the designed UHF antennas, four antenna positions\nnamely, 50cm, 70cm, 100cm and 200cm were used and varied respectively in the experiment. In\naddition, the PD measurement results obtained by using the designed UHF antennas (circular patch\nantenna and rectangular patch antenna) were compared with the existing PD sensors, namely\ncommercial HFCT sensor, loop antenna and Hilbert fractal antenna, available in the laboratory. It\nwas investigated that the designed circular antenna and rectangular antenna are more sensitive than\nloop antenna and Hilbert antenna in detecting corona PD and surface PD emitted from inside of\nthe oil-filled transformer tank model.\nTherefore, in conclusion, the designed UHF antennas (circular microstrip antenna and rectangular\nmicrostrip antenna) presented in this research dissertation have potential to be valid candidate UHF\nPD sensors that can be used for the diagnosis of both air-insulated and oil-insulated HV and MV\npower assets, where irradiated UHF PD signals can be potentially sensed..\n\n5\n\nOverall, this dissertation has proposed cost effective UHF sensors, with optimal capabilities, that\ncan be used for PD detection and measurement on high voltage power apparatus such as on power\ntransformers. The proposed UHF antenna designs in this research will help electricity companies\nto use them as alternative sensors to commercial PD sensors for the diagnosis of high voltage and\nmedium voltage power equipment based on UHF PD detection technology. This research will also\ncontribute as a reference material regarding UHF antenna design for partial discharge\nmeasurements using UHF sensors.", "Daftar File": {"33219701 Jean Pierre Uwiringiyimana.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/304506"}, "Penulis": "Jean Pierre Uwiringiyimana [33219701]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
