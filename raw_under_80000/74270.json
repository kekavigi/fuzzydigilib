The structural vibration due to\nFluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) phenomenon is observed. The dynamic response\nof a piezoelectric-based unimorph plate excited by shedding vortices, or\nso-called Vortex-Induced Vibration (VIV), is investigated. An advanced computational\nmethod is implemented to perform multiphysics analysis. A unified\nfinite element-based software is used. Hence, the responses of fluid, structure\nand electric fields are calculated simultaneously. Benchmark problems\nconcerning unimorph under base excitation conditions are evaluated. Threedimensional\n(3D) and two-dimensional (2D) models are used for the computational\nanalysis. The structural responses from both models depict insignificant\ndifferences (less than 1 %). Moreover, the results obtained from the present\ncomputational scheme are well agreed with the experimental and numerical\ndata from the literature. The main investigation in this work concerns a VIVbased\ncase study concerning a flow-over cylinder exerting a unimorph plate.\nThe voltage output from the present model shows the same level of order during\nsteady condition as the one obtained in the literature, around 1 v/mm\namplitude.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Terang Brilian Brantas [13619074]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ing.
