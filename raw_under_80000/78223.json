{"Nomor": 78223, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT OF POST-STROKE CARE \ufffd\ufffdMOBILE APPLICATION PROTOTYPE", "Abstrak": "This study aims to present the development of a mobile application to enhance post-stroke \nmanagement and care. Therefore, the development of Stroke Digicare serves as a valuable resource \nfor post-stroke patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers, in contributing to the improvement \nof stroke outcomes and enhancing overall quality of post-stroke care. Stroke disease is the leading \ncause of disability worldwide, having high chances of reoccurrence and a long-term continuous \nmanagement. The maintenance of care and therapy plays a crucial role in the recovery process for \npost-stroke patients. However, the current systems often lack personalized support, accessibility, \nhigh cost and integration of essential post-stoke management components. This research \naddresses these limitations by proposing a mobile application called Stroke Digicare, combining \nmedication & clinical scheduling, rehabilitation modules, patient monitoring through video calls and \ncurrent condition input, also medical record list. The research and analysis began with a \ncomprehensive review of literatures and existing mobile applications on post-stroke managements, \nhighlighting the gaps and opportunities for improvement. Based on the analysis, a systematic design \nprocess, prototype development, user testing, and user satisfaction review were carried out. The \nmobile application incorporates evidence-based stroke management guidelines, such as the Global \nStroke Guideline to determine the rehabilitation parameters and features for efficient monitoring \nto facilitate remote care for patients and caregivers. Evaluation of the Stroke Digicare application \nwas conducted through a usability testing method that comprises of two phases, with 30 \nhomogenous participants in the first phase and 50 in the second phase. Results demonstrates the \npotential of mobile application in enhancing post-stroke management and care, having average \nusability score of 81,428 and 82,375. Furthermore, the user satisfaction is assessed though a \nSERVQUAL method which yielded positive feedback towards the importance of available features.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Laurensia Aurel": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/309608"}, "Penulis": "Laurensia Aurel [10719207]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Hubbi Nashrullah Muhammad, S.Farm., M.Si."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sains dan Teknologi Farmasi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Farmasi", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Post-stroke management, mobile application, healthcare, post-stroke care,  rehabilitation, remote monitoring, health application", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Sep 2023"}
