The existence of cavities or voids beneath underground can lead to a serious hazard of building\nconstruction. Cavities typically develop beacuse of subsidence and erosion of the base and subgrade material.\nGround Penetrating Radar (GPR) is one of the most effective tool to GPR has advanced to a level where the\nsubsurface condition can be diagnosed with confidence. This method uses dielectric permittivity, conductivity, and\nmagnetic permeability. In January 2018 tomographic imaging of subsurface feature using GPR has been pursued\nin GWK. This research was focused on analyzing the presence of cavities and other features using GPR modelling.\nGPR measurement has been carried out using the RAMAC GPR instrumentation system of 200 MHz unshielded\nantenna mode. We have performed forward modelling to simulate some conditions of subsurface. Interpreting\nthese reflecting includes measuring the arrival time and the amplitude of reflected signal. GPR technology is very\neffective in identifying areas with changes in physical properties, including potentially hzardous voids. Voids can\nbe either air or water filled; each type of void has a very different GPR signature compared to limestone materials.\nThe result will be correlated with geoelectric interpretation results that have been acquired in July 2013. Regions\nwith amplitude contrast and hyperbolic indicate the presence of cement-filled cavities and other features in the\ndepth of 5-7 meters.", "Daftar File": {"Subsurface Void Investigation using Ground Penetrating Radar in the Garuda Wisnu Kencana (GWK) Bali.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/292272"}, "Penulis": "Dr. Warsa [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jeoreinhard Munandar and IB Suandana Yogi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "GPR technology", "Sumber": "-", "Staf Input/Edit": "Devi Septia Nurul \u00a0\n                                     Devi Septia Nurul", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Jun 2023"}
