An unfortunate yet\nprominent effect of stroke is the loss of fine motor function in a patient's hands,\nwhich causes the inability to perform activities of daily living in a person's life.\nResearch has been conducted on the use of robotic aids to help rehabilitate stroke\npatients, with an increasing number of these designs favouring exoskeletons with\nfluidic elastomer soft actuators as these typically are less complex, cheaper to\nmanufacture, and generally more ergonomic. Nevertheless, commercially available\nsoft robotic exoskeletons are unable to move their patient's fingers independently\nof each other, which in turn limits the patient's recovery as independent finger\nmovement is a crucial aspect of fine motor functions.\nThrough analysing previously published designs and leveraging the experimental\ndesign methodology, a functional system capable of independent finger movements\nfor bilateral hand rehabilitation is designed. The system uses a closed-loop\nProportional, Integral, and Derivative control system with pressure sensors as its\nfeedback. The system is overall quite performant in controlling its pressure values\nwith rise times ranging from 0.6 \u2013 0.65s and settling times ranging from 1.05 \u2013 2s.\nThe system\u2019s accuracy in mirroring movements, however, is still suboptimal as it\nmaps the angle of the trigger to the operational pressures of the glove. The root\nmean squared error of the system\u2019s mirroring response ranges from 53.24 \u2013 81.55\ndegrees. This approach induces a significant amount of variability due to the\ncompressibility of air.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Isaac D. T.
