{"Nomor": 72247, "Judul": "PERFORMANCE AND MOTIVATION IN A MIDDLE SCHOOL FLIPPED LEARNING COURSE", "Abstrak": "Flipped learning is a teaching approach that promotes\ncollaboration by using technology to \u2018flip\u2019 traditional\ninstruction. Content is delivered outside of class in the individual\nspace (online) and the group space (classroom) is used\nto engage in collaborative activities. Flipped learning shifts\nthe teacher\u2019s role toward facilitation. Research on flipped\nlearning is limited, in that studies are mostly conducted in\npostsecondary classrooms. My study investigated a middle\nschool classroom \u2013 focusing on a 6th grade social studies\ncourse at a K-12 private school in Hawai\u2019i. My purpose was\nto identify the relationship between student motivation and\nperformance in a flipped learning course. Following an\neight-week unit of study, performance data was collected\nand a Likert-type survey was administered. Significant differences\nin survey responses between performance levels revealed\nthat the technology-based content in flipped learning\nmay lead to increased motivation and improved performance.\nAlso, my findings suggest flipped learning benefits average\nachieving students through differentiated instruction. My\nstudy was designed to influence middle school practice but\ncan apply to other educational levels. Practical implications\ninclude designing learning spaces to maximize student engagement\nand incorporating learner-appropriate strategies\nwith flipped learning. Future research should focus on learning\nspace design in different K-12 environments.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Joshua W.
