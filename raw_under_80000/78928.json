{"Nomor": 78928, "Judul": "PITCH RATE TRACKING CONTROLLER DESIGN FOR F-16 FIGHTER AIRCRAFT USING LQR APPROACH", "Abstrak": "The F-16 fighter aircraft is a highly maneuverable aircraft with relaxed static stability (RSS). This allows the aircraft to have high agility and acceleration, but it also makes it more difficult to control. A pitch rate tracking controller can control the aircraft more easily by tracking the desired pitch rate.\nThis research presents the development and evaluation of a pitch rate tracking controller for the F-16 aircraft using the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) approach with integral action. A non-linear dynamic model of the F-16 aircraft was developed using data from a NASA report. The non-linear model was then linearized to obtain the characteristics of the aircraft. An LQR controller with integral action was designed using the linearized model, using both 2-state and 3-state feedback. The cost matrix for the LQR controller was designed around the nominal condition of 100 m/s at sea level, to be used for a variety of speeds and heights. One set of gains and one set of gain scheduling based on the cost matrix were used for performance comparison.\nThe results suggest that the LQR approach with integral action is a promising approach for designing pitch rate tracking controllers for the F-16 aircraft, with one set of gain have a faster response time and smaller means squared error. However, more research is needed to address the issue of the controller's performance at high angles of attack.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Hilmi [13618020]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ony Arifianto, Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Pitch rate controller, LQR, integral action", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Nov 2023"}
