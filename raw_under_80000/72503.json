{"Nomor": 72503, "Judul": "ANALYSIS OF ROADHEADER PERFORMANCE ON THE NOTOG RAILWAY TUNNEL", "Abstrak": "The Notog tunnel is a double-track railway tunnel that will link the cities of Purwokerto and Kroya in the Central Java Province, Indonesia. This NATM tunnel, which is 11 m in diameter and 471 m in length, will pass through a mountain range near the Notog Village. One of the important factors in the construction of this 471 m long tunnel is the excavation of the tunnel using a Mitsui MT 1500G Roadheader. The performance prediction of the roadheader is obtained from several well-known empirical equations: Bilgin (1990), Kramadibrata (1996) and Copur (1998). The prediction is then compared with the actual roadheader productivity in the field for analysis and evaluation. The results show that Bilgin\u2019s equation can be used to predict the roadheader performance for various rock strengths while that of Kramadibrata\u2019s equation is only suitable for hard rocks.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Ganda M.
