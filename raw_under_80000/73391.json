{"Nomor": 73391, "Judul": "INTEGRATED RESERVOIR CHARACTERIZATION USING MACHINE LEARNING METHOD", "Abstrak": "In the oil and gas industry, knowledge of reservoirs is crucial. Reservoir characterization is performed to determine\nthe performance of a reservoir in storing and producing fluids by determining the reservoir's information and\nproperties. Simulating reservoir models for field development can be aided by formation type, porosity,\npermeability, and water saturation data. Conducting formation, porosity, permeability, and water saturation\nanalyses can be time-consuming and expensive. An effective and efficient method is required to obtain formation,\nporosity, permeability, and water saturation data.\nThis case study predicts formation, porosity, permeability, and water saturation using well log data and core\nanalysis from 12 wells containing six distinct formations. Several models will be trained using machine learning\nto predict formation, porosity, permeability, and water saturation. In practice, using all the data may result in\nsuboptimal predictions, so feature selection and data preprocessing are crucial prior to training the models with\nthe data. In addition, hyperparameter tuning will be performed to optimize the training performance of the model.\nThe leave-out well method is also employed to evaluate the model's ability to predict new data. After evaluating\nthe entire model, the best model will be used to predict specific properties. According to the findings of this study,\nthe accuracy of predictions made using machine learning techniques is satisfactory.\nIn this study, three scenarios will be compared: making predictions using only well log data, using well log data\nin addition to formation data, porosity, permeability, and water saturation from interpretation and measurement,\nand making integrated predictions using well log data in addition to formation data, porosity, permeability, and\nwater saturation from machine learning model predictions. Using machine learning techniques, the results of this\ncomparison will be used to determine the optimal scenario for predicting formation, porosity, permeability, and\nwater saturation.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Alfigo Tryozi Safrio Zulvan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/293337"}, "Penulis": "Alfigo Tryozi Safrio Zulvan [12219069]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Dedy Irawan, S.T, M.T.", "Pahala Dominicus Sinurat, S.T, M.Sc., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Reservoir characterization, Machine learning, Formation, Porosity, Permeability, Water saturation", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Jun 2023"}
