{"Nomor": 70528, "Judul": "PHOTOPERIODIC INDUCTION AND SYNCHRONIZATION OF FLOWERING IN SUGARCANE HYBRIDS FOR BREEDING PROGRAMS", "Abstrak": "Profuse and synchronized flowering is a prerequisite\nfor breeding crop plants. Sugarcane, known for its\nhighly variable flowering behavior, requires specific photoperiodic\nregimes. Repeated experiments in photoperiodic\nchamber (for 3 years) and field trials (for 2 years) were\nattempted to standardize the physiological interventions\nrequired for induction of flowering as well as its synchronization.\nFlowering was induced in 36 out of 46 clones\ntreated in the photoperiodic chamber with two sets of\ntreatments, commencing with a photoperiod of either 12 h\n45 min or 12 h 55 min, followed by declining day length at\nthe rate of 60 s day-1 for 85 and 75 cycles, respectively.\nHistological studies indicated conversion of vegetative to\nreproductive bud due to photoperiodic treatments, while\ntemperature was a determining factor for panicle emergence\nor reversion to vegetative state. In the field trials,\nnight interruption (with lighting for a period of 30 days)\nfollowed by post-inductive constant photoperiod of 12 h\n40 min delayed flowering by a minimum of 4 days up to\n39 days. These experiments confirmed that sugarcane\nflowering may be manipulated through photoperiodic\ntreatments for the successful hybridization of desired parental\nclones in breeding programs.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Krishnapriya Vengavasi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Vasantha Srinivasavedantham\u2022 Arun Kumar Raja\u2022 Arjun Shaligram Tayade\u2022 Bakshi Ram"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Life sciences ; biology", "Kata Kunci": "Floral induction, Floral ontogeny, Photoperiod, Sugarcane breeding", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "16 Jan 2023"}
