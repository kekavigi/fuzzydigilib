Three hundred and ninety-five\nrespondents completed a survey conducted online using a stratified random\nsampling technique on five main islands in Indonesia. Amos v25 was used in\nthis study to perform structural equation modelling (SEM). The findings\nreveal that the perceived positive impact has the most significant influence on\nthe resident's attitude to participate in new capital city development. From the\nperspective of Theory planned behaviour only subjective norm and Perceived\nbehaviour control influence the resident's intentions to participate in new\ncapital city development. As a result, it proves that although the sustainable\ndevelopment impacts affect residents' attitudes towards capital city\ndevelopment, their attitudes do not affect their intention to participate in\ncapital development. Hence, it would be concluded the Indonesian\ngovernment is still non-optimal on socializing the economic, social, and\nenvironmental policies implemented in the new capital.", "Daftar File": {"2023_TS_PP_Desy Triana_29121562_1-Full Thesis.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/309464"}, "Penulis": "Desy Triana [29121562]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr.Salmi Mohd Isa"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Magister Bisnis dan Administrasi - Teknologi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Subjek": "General management", "Kata Kunci": "Resident perceptions; Theory planned behaviour; Sustainable development; New capital city development Impacts; Structural modelling.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yose Ali Rahman", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Sep 2023"}
