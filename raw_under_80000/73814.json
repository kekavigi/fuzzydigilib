The dengue virus (DENV) NS2B/NS3 protease is considered an \nimportant protein which is responsible in viral maturation of DENV. So far, there are no specific \nmedications for treatment of dengue. Therefore, research regarding dengue treatment is needed \nand one of potential targets is NS2B/NS3 protease. Potential inhibitors of NS2B/NS3 protease can \nbe explored by using empirical data of medicinal plant. The data shows that Carica papaya, native \nplant in tropical area at Central America and South of Mexico, is often cultivated and used for \nmedical purposes such as dengue. Objective: Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore and \ndetermine potential compounds in Carica papaya leaf as DENV NS2B/NS3 protease inhibitor based \non in silico study. Methodology: Initial study was conducted by literature study to collect a list of \ncompounds in C. papaya leaf. The 3D structure of 31 compounds was modeled with Avogadro 1.2.0 \nsoftware and the geometrical optimization was done in ORCA 4.2.1 software. Then, the affinity \ntowards DENV NS2B/NS3 protease was determined by molecular docking simulation using \nAutoDock 4.2 and MGLTools 1.5.7 software. Besides the affinity towards protease, the ADMET \nprediction was also conducted for the potential compounds to be developed as an oral drug. ADME \nprediction was conducted by SwissADME, while the toxicity prediction was conducted using VEGA \n1.2.3 software. Results and Discussion: The docking simulation results showed that all compounds \nhave affinity towards NS2B/NS3 protease by giving negative value of binding free energy. However, \nonly 15 compounds fulfill the Lipinski\u2019s Rule of Five. Further investigation regarding detail\ninteraction and ADMET prediction was conducted by exploring the 7 best compounds which are \ndicoumarol, luteolin, apigenin, quercetin, coumaroylquinic acid, kaempferol, and caffeic acid. \nConclusion: Based on affinity towards NS2B/NS3 protease and ADMET prediction, the best two \ncompounds that are potential as candidates for oral anti-dengue drug are apigenin, kaempferol. \nThese two compounds have similar conformation with native ligand of NS2B/NS3 protease and bind \nto a key residue of the NS2B/NS3 protease. These compounds were also chosen based on Lipinski\u2019s \nRule of Five that are related to the bioavailability as an oral drug and relatively low toxicity.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Nadhindra Nashifuddin Alhakim": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/294182"}, "Penulis": "Nadhindra Nashifuddin Alhakim [10719202]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. rer. nat.
