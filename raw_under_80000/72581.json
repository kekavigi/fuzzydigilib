{"Nomor": 72581, "Judul": "GEOSTATISTICAL DRILL HOLE SPACING ANALYSIS FOR COAL RESOURCE EVALUATION IN THE SOUTH SUMATRA BASIN, INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "The classification of coal resources used in Indonesia is currently based on the guidelines of SNI 5015:2019\nwhich is considering three differences in geological and data complexities, i.e. simple, moderate, and complex.\nThis study performed the Drill Hole Spacing Analysis (DHSA) using Global Estimation Variance (GEV) method\nto optimize and evaluate the coal resources of a seam in a coal mine site. This study was conducted for coal\ndeposits in the Muara Enim Formation, South Sumatra Basin, Indonesia. The results of this study showed that Pit\nX with simple geological complexity has optimum drill hole spacing of 350 m, 1000 m, and >1000 m, respectively\nfor the measured, indicated, and inferred categories. This study showed that the optimum drill hole spacing\ndetermined by the GEV in general was more confident (closer) compared to the drill hole spacing required in SNI\n5015:2019.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Jovian Addo Putra": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/288995", "2022 JOVIAN ADDO PUTRA 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/288996", "2022 JOVIAN ADDO PUTRA 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/288997", "2022 JOVIAN ADDO PUTRA 1-PAPER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/288998"}, "Penulis": "Jovian Addo Putra [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mohamad Nur Heriawan, Agus Haris Widayat"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Geostatistical Drill Hole Spacing Analysis for Coal Resource Evaluation in the South Sumatra Basin, Indonesia", "Sumber": "International Symposium on Earth Science and Technology 2022", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani \u00a0\n                                     Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Apr 2023"}
