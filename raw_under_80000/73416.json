{"Nomor": 73416, "Judul": "SIMULATION OF SURFACTANT-POLYMER COREFLOOD EXPERIMENT AND SENSITIVITY OF CHEMICAL CONCENTRATION", "Abstrak": "Surfactant-polymer injection has become a popular method for enhancing oil production in mature oil fields due to its benefits of reducing interfacial tension and controlling fluid mobility. This study focuses on the construction of a simulation model for surfactant-polymer injection based on laboratory experimental data, followed by the validation of the model through comparison with coreflooding test outcomes. Coreflooding simulation model was developed using lab data and then history matched to resemble the actual experimental conditions. The parameters tested in the study included the endpoint and curvature of oil and water relative permeability curves, as well as surfactant capillary de-saturation functions. The 1-D model included \"producer\" and \"injector\" wells at the grid edges to replicate the coreflood apparatus. The model was built using Cartesian coordinates and tNavigator (RFD) software. The history matching process during the waterflood and surfactant-polymer injection stages showed satisfactory alignment between various parameters, including oil, water, pressure, and water cut, and the experimental results. Sensitivity analysis was carried out by combining the addition or reduction of the concentration of surfactants and polymers. Changing the surfactant concentration to 0.5%, 0.3%, and 0.1% produced oil recoveries of 82.24%, 80.70%, and 47.87%, respectively, according to the sensitivity analysis. Similar to this, changing the polymer concentration to 500 ppm, 1000 ppm, and 5000 ppm resulted in respective oil recoveries of 74.19%, 80.70%, and 82.31%.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Wilson Natanael": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/293360"}, "Penulis": "Wilson Natanael [12219074]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ivan Kurnia, S.T., M.Sc., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "simulation model, coreflooding, surfactant-polymer injection.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Jun 2023"}
