{"Nomor": 71922, "Judul": "PROPOSED DOMESTIC COAL PRICE IN INDONESIA CONSIDERING SUPPLY AND DEMAND FACTORS BY USING SYSTEM DYNAMICS METHOD", "Abstrak": "Coal is one of the main energy sources used in Indonesia to fulfill domestic electricity supply. An optimal coal\nexploitation strategy is needed to meet domestic needs while meeting the demands of the coal export market. In\nfact, coal demand for domestic electricity supply has not been met or several periods of time. One of the identified\ncauses is that there is a discrepancy between the domestic price of coal and the export price of coal. This analysis\nwas conducted to identify the influence of external factors on determining the domestic price of coal in Indonesia\nand to estimate the domestic price of coal with the influence of these variables. The analytical method used is he\nsystem dynamics method using Vensim software. The system dynamics method is used to determine the complex\nrelationship between supply and demand conditions for coal, as well as economic growth factors on determining\nthe domestic price of coal. Furthermore, causal loop diagrams and system /flow diagrams will be obtained to form\nan equation of domestic coal prices based on predetermined factor variables. The data that will be utilized in this\nmodel are coal price, economic growth which is represented by GDP growth in Indonesia, and historical DMO\nachievement data. The initial hypothesis states that coal supply-demand factors, coal prices, and economic growth\nhave an effect on determining the domestic coal prices with varying levels of significance according to the historical data.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Siwi Adwitiya Hadi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/282097", "2022 SIWI ADWITIYA HADI 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/282098", "2022 SIWI ADWITIYA HADI 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/282099", "2022 SIWI ADWITIYA HADI 1-PAPER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/282101"}, "Penulis": "Siwi Adwitiya Hadi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Firly Rachmaditya Baskoro, Aryo Prawoto Wibowo, Fadhila Achmadi Rosyid\u201d?"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "coal, domestic coal price, economic growth, supply demand, system dynamics", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Feb 2023"}
