{"Nomor": 73296, "Judul": "THE EFFECT OF SALT CONCENTRATION ON LOW SALINITY WATER INJECTION FOR ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY IN DEAD OIL CARBONATE RESERVOIRS: A COMPREHENSIVE SIMULATION STUDY", "Abstrak": "This study focuses on the effect of well placement, injection rate, and salt concentration on recovering dead oil in carbonate reservoirs. The study findings indicate that implementing Low Salinity Water Injection (LSWI) resulted in higher oil recovery than conventional waterflooding. Numerical simulations using the tNavigatorTM Simulator evaluated the performance of LSWI. The Salting-in Effect mechanism, which modifies the salt concentration at the clay surface in the reservoir, played a crucial role in enhancing oil solubility and detachment from clay surfaces, leading to improved oil production. Two different well placements with varying patterns and injection rates of 5,000 stbd and 10,000 stbd were used to evaluate their impact. The preparation of low-salinity water involves diluting the formation water\u2019s salt concentration, which starts at an initial concentration of 20,000 ppm. The simulation includes four distinct dilution levels: LSWI 1, two times diluted; LSWI 2, four times diluted; LSWI 3, ten times diluted; and LSWI 4, twenty times diluted. The simulation revealed optimal results with well placement B, utilizing injection water diluted 20 times (1,000 ppm) and an injection rate of 10,000 stbd, resulting in a total incremental recovery of 10.21%.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Ahmad Yusuf Maulana Zulkarnaen": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/293211"}, "Penulis": "Ahmad Yusuf Maulana Zulkarnaen [12219016]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Rani Kurnia, S.Si., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Low salinity water injection, dead oil, Carbonate", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Jun 2023"}
