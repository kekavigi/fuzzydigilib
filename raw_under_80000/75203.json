{"Nomor": 75203, "Judul": "COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS ON LIQUID LOADING PROBLEM AT FIELD Y USING MACHINE LEARNING AND DECLINE CURVE ANALYSIS", "Abstrak": "Liquid loading in gas production wells is a serious production problem. Liquid loading can reduce production capacity\nand even kill the well at any time. Therefore the prediction of the critical rate of liquid loading must be accurate. An\naccurate critical rate prediction will also provide an accurate prediction of the time liquid loading occurs in a well.\nCurrently a popular method for calculating the critical rate of liquid loading of a well is to use empirical equations\nsuch as the turner equation, Coleman Equation and Li Min Equation. The popular method used today has several\ndrawbacks in calculating Interfacial Tension, which can give a large difference between the predicted critical rate and\nthe actual critical rate.\nThis study uses a machine learning approach to predict the critical rate of liquid loading with limited data. The\nalgorithms used in this study are KNN, Gradient Boosting, Extreme Gradient Boosting and Random Forest. The\ndataset was taken from 49 wells that had experienced liquid loading in field Y with swamp zone characteristics. The\nmost suitable machine learning model will be used to predict the critical rates of two wells that have never experienced\nliquid loading. Decline Curve Analysis is used to predict when these two wells will experience liquid loading.\nThe results of the analysis of this study show that the best machine learning model for calculating the critical rate of\nliquid loading in field Y is the random forest. This is because the random forest has good performance evaluation\nparameter values and has the lowest possible overfitting among other machine learning models.\nThe Random Forest model is used to calculate the critical rate of the Y-TM1 and Y-TM2 wells. Using Decline Curve\nAnalysis liquid loading will occur in well Y-TM1 on September 2023 and well Y-TM2 on late July 2023.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Habil Luthfi Rahman": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/299930"}, "Penulis": "Habil Luthfi Rahman [12219021]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Silvya Dewi Rahmawati, S.Si, M.Si., Ph.D.", "Rahman Setiadi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "critical gas rate, liquid loading, machine learning, decline curve analysis", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Jul 2023"}
