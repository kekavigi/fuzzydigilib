This study explores different dimensions and geometries by evaluating\ntwo performance parameters of structural behavior, namely specific energy\nabsorption (SEA) and maximum stress experienced by the battery. In this research,\na finite element simulation will be carried out on the AT chassis structure with side\nimpact cases. Finite element simulations for side crashes for various configurations\nare made as input material for the optimization process using machine learning\nmethods. The optimization process is carried out through the stages of ANN,\nNSGA-II, and TOPSIS. ANN is performed to produce a regression model for each\nparameter. NSGA-II is performed to estimate possible solutions for predetermined\nlimits and objectives, while TOPSIS is used to select the most optimal solution\nfrom these possible solutions. The results of machine learning estimation for the\noptimum design are tested using the finite element method as validation. The optimization\nresults show that the optimum cross-car structure configuration estimate\nis made using AA6061-T6 material, section C with a cross-sectional size of 80mm,\nthickness of 3mm, and half of the distance between the batteries is 5mm. This configuration\nincreases performance compared to the initial model at the resulting SEA\nvalue of 44.4% with stress experienced by the battery of 61.7 MPa.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Riefki Aditya Pamungkas [13619008]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
