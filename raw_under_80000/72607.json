{"Nomor": 72607, "Judul": "TECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF NARROW GOLD VEIN UNDERGROUND MINING, A CASE STUDY IN PT ANTAM TBK UBPE PONGKOR", "Abstrak": "PT Antam Tbk UBPE Pongkor has discovered narrow gold vein in its mining area. This narrow vein cannot be\nmined by using mechanized cut and fill mining method. Other methods which are resuing or shrinkage stoping\nunderground mining method will be developed to mine these narrow veins. Technical design parameters for\neach proposed mining method were calculated based on the field data. It consists of opening width, blasting\npattern, supporting system, productivity, and break even cut of grade. Each method has its own advantages and\ndisadvantages based on the technical analysis. As result, resuing method will produce cleaner ore and higher\nCOG, however, need more support materials and explosives.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Budi Sulistianto": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289407", "2016 BUDI SULISTIANTO 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289408", "2016 BUDI SULISTIANTO 1-PAPER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289409"}, "Penulis": "Budi Sulistianto [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Firly R.
