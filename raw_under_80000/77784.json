{"Nomor": 77784, "Judul": "SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF MISCIBLE CONTINUOUS CO2 INJECTION PARAMETERS TO INCREASE OIL RECOVERY FACTOR IN RESERVOIR WITH PRESSURE BELOW MISCIBILITY PRESSURE WITH FIVE-SPOT INJECTION PATTERN", "Abstrak": "Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) through CO2 injection method can reduce oil viscosity and enhance oil mobility, making it easier for the oil to flow towards the production well. The effectiveness of miscible CO2 injection schemes is notably higher, resulting in increased oil recovery compared to immiscible schemes. Consequently, Minimum Miscibility Pressure (MMP) becomes a crucial consideration in CO2 injection methods.\nIn this study, miscible continuous CO2 injection is applied to oil reservoirs with pressure below the MMP. Water injection is conducted to raise reservoir pressure to the MMP, ensuring miscible condition is achieved. Subsequently, sensitivity analyses of injection parameters such as bottom hole injection pressure and CO2 injection rate are performed to observe their influence on the oil recovery factor. The oil recovery factor from continuous CO2 injection will then be compared with natural flow, Water Alternating Gas (WAG), and waterflood methods.\nThis study results indicate that a miscible scheme for continuous CO2 injection can be applied in reservoir with pressure below the MMP by increasing reservoir pressure through water injection. This is feasible if MMP is lower than the formation fracture pressure. Sensitivity analysis reveals that higher bottom hole injection pressure corresponds to a higher oil recovery factor. Similarly, an increased CO2 injection rate yields a higher oil recovery factor but may expedite CO2 breakthrough to production wells. The study also demonstrates that the WAG method yields the highest oil recovery factor compared to natural flow, continuous CO2 injection, and waterflood methods.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Johanes Christopher Napitupulu": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/308632"}, "Penulis": "Johanes Christopher Napitupulu [12219040]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
