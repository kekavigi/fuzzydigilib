{"Nomor": 78092, "Judul": "EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF ROUGHNESS PARAMETER USING TURBULENT BOUNDARY LAYER ANALYSIS AT LOW TO MODERATE REYNOLDS NUMBER", "Abstrak": "There are two types of flow that exist in this world, namely the laminar and\nturbulent flow, where turbulent flow is found to be more common. Interestingly,\ninvestigation of turbulence through standard boundary layer analysis\ncan be used to determine roughness parameter experimentally. Characteristics\nof turbulent flow over smooth and rough surfaces were then measured in\nthe closed loop wind tunnel of ITB with utilization of Hotwire Anemometer\n(MUCTA) at low to moderate Reynolds number. The results from experiment\nover both surfaces were then analyzed and compared. Roughness parameters\nof the rough surface were also determined and compared to the roughness\nfunction dependence on the equivalent sand grain roughness and the ks value\ndetermined by Squire, et al (Comparison of turbulent boundary layers over\nsmooth and rough surfaces up to high Reynolds numbers, vol 795, 2016, J.\nFluid Mech).", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Asiah Annur Sarhani [13619109]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
