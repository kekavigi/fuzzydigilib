While in the consumer market, the buying process is much simpler.\n\nOBB is an important theory because it studies about how organizations think, how they decide and how they take the action of their buying decision. The seminal studies on OBB include the general model for understanding organizational buying behavior by Robinson et al (1969), Frederick Webster and Yoram Wind (1972), and the model of industrial buyer behavior by Jagdish Sheth (1973). Their studies gave a conceptual foundation for the development of organizational buying behavior theory.\n\nLiteratures review revealed that previous studies of OBB were mostly talked about large companies. Limited attention is directed at a small business in the organizational buying behavior and small company literature. Hence, little knowledge of the buying practices of small company owners can be found in previous literature. Also, most of buying theories are inappropriate for the small business.\n\nRegarding the size of the company and the buying approach, it might appear that there should be differences between the small company and large company in terms of buying process. So, this situation raises questions and doubt when the result of previous studies adopted by small companies. This study will explore this gap and then will fill the gap by examining factors of small-scale organizational buying behavior into the context of Batik business in Indonesia.\n\nBatik is a national heritage of Indonesia and since 2009 Unesco stated that Batik as a world masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. There are thousands of Batik entrepreneurs in Indonesia, and 98% of them are small firms. However nowadays the Batik business trend is booming, and its sale is increasing, also at the same time it creates many job opportunities to reduce unemployment number.\n\nA qualitative research method was conducted to achieve the research objective. There is two stage of a case study in this research; the first stage is an exploratory case study, and the second stage is the explanatory case study. The exploratory case study has been able to create the organizational buying behavior for small business, which called Small Batik Business Buying Behavior (SB4) model. The exploratory study also revealed the variables that contributed to the SB4 model. In the explanatory case study check the model and its variables by five cases from the small batik business category.The unit analysis is the small scale Batik companies in Indonesia. The findings of this research are to develop a model of organizational buying behavior for the small business in Indonesia.\n\nThe limitation of this research is that the scope of this research was conducted in a particular industry that is the Batik small size business. This study is cross-sectional research while the phenomenon that is being modeled is evolving over time.\n\nThere are opportunities for a continuation of this study in the future. The possibility of applying this SB4 to any business outside Batik industry, so that the next SB4 model become a general of Small Business Buying Behavior (SB3) model. It will be interesting to test the variables and their relationships which found in this research quantitatively. Last but not least, summary of the state-of-the-art of this SB4 model from literature review shows that there are many opportunities available for future studies in this area.", "Daftar File": {"2015 DS PP Moses Lorensius P Hutabarat   [39010012] - Full Text.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/280661"}, "Penulis": "Moses Lorensius P Hutabarat [39010012]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
