Previous research already pointed out the types of fly ash, distinguished based on its origin and\noperating process during combustion. One of the types is fly ash with high neutralization capacity, mainly due to\nthe high temperature during combustion process. As a part of an integrated research to better understand fly ash\nJor its utilization regarding AMD management, this study was carried out.\n\nPotentially acid forming (PAP) rock is the source of AMD, contained sulfide minerals that produce acidity if\nweathered due to oxidation reaction. The common methods in reducing AMD generation are PAF rock\nencapsulation and/or mixing/blending PAF rock with alkaline materials, hence the acidity production will be\nminimized. This study aims to correlate fly ash utilization with both methods in order to recognize the most effective\nuse. Moreover, due to the regulation in Indonesia which classify /ly ash as hazardous material, it is important to\nadeguately confirm its utilization, especially for fly ash effect to the environment. This study shows that in using\nJly ash with high neutralizing capacity, material mixing with PAF is sufficient to reduce AMD generation. In\nlayering method, buffering reaction from fly ash to acidic water cannot significanily increase the pH in limited\nthickness. Meanwhile, blending fly ash with PAF is shown to escalate the pH to near-neutral as increasing\nthickness of material mixture in positive correlation.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Ginting Jalu Kusuma": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289145", "2018 GINTING JALU KUSUMA 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289146", "2018 GINTING JALU KUSUMA 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289147", "2018 GINTING JALU KUSUMA 1-PAPER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289148"}, "Penulis": "Ginting Jalu Kusuma [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Rudy Sayoga Gautama, Sendy Dwiki and Abie Badhurahman"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Apr 2023"}
