{"Nomor": 74048, "Judul": "INVESTIGATING AIR-PARTICLE INTERACTION IN CONTINUOUS FLUIDIZED BED REACTORS FOR GOLD SULPHIDE ORE USING COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS (CFD) SIMULATION", "Abstrak": "The extraction of gold from sulphide ores using cyanide leaching is a wellestablished\nprocess in the metallurgy industry. However, the sulphide ore is\nrequired roasting process to obtain high recovery rate. As a result, fluidized-bed\ntechnology has been widely used for roasting. This study focuses on investigating\nair-particle interaction in continuous fluidized bed reactors for gold sulphide ore\nusing CFD simulation.\nThe reactor used for simulation is a continuous fluidized-bed reactor with a height\nof 10.8m, freeboard diameter of 9.5m, and bed diameter of 7.3m. The bottom\nsection of the reactor has a wind box and distributor plate. The wind box has a\ncenter inlet and 4 side inlets that supported air to the distribution plate and distribute\nto the top section of the reactor. The top section of the reactor has one feed inlet for\nslurry, one product outlet, and one gas outlet. Because the reactor that has been used\nfor simulation is industrial scale, it has a relatively complex geometry. Thus, to\nreduce the computational time but get representative results, the reactor was\nsimplified and divided into two sections. The top section is 2D and the bottom is\nsection 3D. The simulation consists of 11 variants. Each variant is divided into two\nstages. The first stage is simulating the air blower that will be in contact with the\ndistribution plate before being injected inside the reactor. The second stage is the\ninteraction of air and particle inside the reactor. First-stage simulation and secondstage\nsimulation were simulated separately from the first-stage simulation because\nof concerns about reducing simulation complexity and having different analysis\ntargets. The first stage simulation was carried out using Fluid Flow CFX and the\nsecond stage was carried out using Fluid Flow Fluent with a Hybrid of Eulerian-\nEulerian multi-phase model and discrete phase model (HEEDPM).\nThe result of this simulation provides insights into operational conditions related to\nair-particle interaction. The simulation result exhibits the closest approximation to\nthe existing design is simulation 4 with average volume 0.0637 faction and the\n97.6% success of roasting.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Kelwin": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/294482"}, "Penulis": "Kelwin [12519001]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["D.Sc.(Tech.)
