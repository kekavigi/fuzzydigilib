Proper understanding of this phenomenon is also important in\nmany engineering fields. The increasing trend of the use of thin flexible structures,\nsuch as in long-span bridges, tall buildings, and light aerial vehicles, requires\naccurate prediction of the FSI phenomenon since it can exhibit catastrophic failures\nto the structures. This phenomenon can also be used for beneficial purposes, such\nas for the flutter energy harvesting system. The interactions of the flow and the thin\nflexible structures, however, are yet to be fully understood due to complex\nbehaviours governing the interactions and limitations in measuring and modeling\nthe systems.\nIn the present work, the fluid-structure interaction of flexible thin structures\nundergoing large displacements is investigated through numerical simulations. A\nnew FSI algorithm is proposed to achieve this objective. This FSI algorithm is\ndeveloped via a partitioned approach. In this context, the flow is resolved using the\nremeshed-Vortex Particle Method (R-VPM), whereas the response of the flexible\nstructure is evaluated using a FEM-based elastodynamics solver. The Vortex\nParticle Method (VPM) has been considered an accurate and efficient\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool to simulate flow around complex\ngeometries. In this study, the existing remeshed-VPM is modified and extended\nwith new developments to enhance its applicability for complex FSI simulations of\nthin flexible structures. In this context, the remeshed-VPM algorithm is combined\nwith the iterative Brinkman penalization method and a multiresolution scheme to\naccurately enforce the boundary conditions on a thin immersed solid. A new force\nformulation is developed, applicable to generate accurate distributed body forces\neven though the iterative Brinkman penalization is employed.\nThe flow solver is coupled with an elastodynamics solver that can accurately\nsimulate the dynamic analysis of flexible thin structures undergoing large\ndisplacements. In the present work, the structural dynamics is evaluated using\ncorotational beam formulation since it is simple, accurate, and efficient to solve\ngeometrically nonlinear structures. A consistent and energy-preserving two  dimensional (2D) corotational beam formulation is employed to maintain accuracy\nand stability for long-term FSI simulations. The novelty is the extension of this\napproach from the two-dimensional (2D) formulation to a three-dimensional (3D)\nformulation.\nBoth the flow solver and the structural solver are validated using a number of\npopular benchmark problems available in the literature, both for 2D and 3D cases.\nComparisons between the simulation results with some numerical data show very\ngood agreement. The flow solver is more accurate and efficient than the pure\nLagrangian and standard remeshed-VPM since accurate results with great\nefficiency can be achieved by the combination of the multiresolution scheme with\nthe iterative Brinkman penalization method. Regarding the structural solver, it is\nconcluded that it is more accurate and stable than the non-consistent and nonenergy-\nconserving corotational formulation and its efficiency can be improved by\nthe use of the simplified version of the consistent corotational formulation.\nThe flow and structural solvers are coupled using a loosely coupled scheme and the\ncoupled FSI algorithm is validated on large-displacement FSI benchmark problems\nsuch as cantilever oscillation due to vortex shedding from a square cylinder and\nlarge amplitude flapping of an inverted flag in a uniform flow. The results are in\nexcellent agreement with some numerical simulations and experimental\nmeasurements available in the literature. Due to the rich set of complex interactions\nof the generated wake dynamics with the flexible inverted flag, the FSI solver is\nfurther employed in a series of FSI simulations using this inverted flag model to\nunderstand the physics governing these complex interactions. The proposed FSI\nsolver demonstrates its capability as a reliable means to study the physics of some\nmain modes of the inverted flag systems.\nThe original contributions of this work are: a new force formulation based on\ncorrected penalization velocity that is capable to generate distributed body forces,\napplicable for both classical and iterative Brinkman penalization method; the\nextension of the multiresolution scheme using patches to 3D remeshed-VPM; the\ndevelopment and application of consistent and approximately energy-preserving\n3D corotational beam formulation for nonlinear dynamics of highly flexible\nstructures; the development and application of a multiresolution scheme combined\nwith the iterative Brinkman penalization method for remeshed-VPM, both for 2D\nand 3D flow and FSI applications; the applications of fully 3D remeshed-VPM\ncoupled with 3D consistent and energy-conserving corotational beam formulation\nfor FSI simulations of the inverted flag system; and the exposition of the flapping\nmechanism of an inverted flag system.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Novi Andria": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/269286"}, "Penulis": "Novi Andria [33615302]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Hari Muhammad", "Dr. Ir.
