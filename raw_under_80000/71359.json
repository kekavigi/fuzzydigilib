In pharmacological intervention development for sarcopenia\nmanagement, there is an urgent need to identify biomarkers to measure in clinical trials and that could be used in the future\nin clinical practice. The objective of the current consensus paper is to provide a clear list of biochemical markers of musculoskeletal\nhealth and aging that can be recommended to be measured in Phase II and Phase III clinical trials evaluating new\nchemical entities for sarcopenia treatment. A working group of the European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of\nOsteoporosis, Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases (ESCEO) proposed classifying biochemical markers into 2 series:\nbiochemical markers evaluating musculoskeletal status and biochemical markers evaluating causal factors. For series 1, the\ngroup agreed on 4 biochemical markers that should be assessed in Phase II or Phase III trials (i.e., Myostatin-Follistatin,\nBrain Derived Neurotrophic Factor, N-terminal Type III Procollagen and Serum Creatinine to Serum Cystatin C Ratio \u2013 or\nthe Sarcopenia Index). For series 2, the group agreed on 6 biochemical markers that should be assessed in Phase II trials\n(i.e., the hormones insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I), dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, and cortisol, and the inflammatory\nmarkers C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-?), and 2 in Phase III trials (i.e., IGF-I and CRP).\nThe group also proposed optional biochemical markers that may provide insights into the mode of action of pharmacological\ntherapies. Further research and development of new methods for biochemical marker assays may lead to the evolution\nof these recommendations.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Aurelie Ladang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Charlotte Beaudart, Jean?Yves Reginster"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "Springer", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Feb 2023"}
