{"Nomor": 77839, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT OF MACHINE LEARNING-BASED TURBULENCE MODEL WITH EXPLAINABILITY TECHNIQUE", "Abstrak": "Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) method is highly favoured for turbulent\nflow simulation due to its efficiency and relatively lower computational\ncost than other methods. This method requires an appropriate turbulence\nmodel to obtain an accurate turbulent flow solution. In this work, we develop\nthree machine learning-based turbulence models and one of them is our proposed\nFeedforward Neural Network (FFNN) architecture. All of these models\nare used to calculate the Reynolds stress based on the flow properties from\nRANS data. These models are tested in several flow configurations where the\nRANS model as the conventional method struggles. This study demonstrates\nthat our proposed neural network model surpasses the benchmark performance\nof the conventional k ? ? turbulence model and outperforms other machine\nlearning-based turbulence models. The results show that the Reynolds stress\nfield predicted by the proposed neural network closely resembles the Direct Numerical\nSimulation and Large Eddy Simulation. In this work, we also studied\nthe effect of input feature selection on the model\u2019s accuracy and performed feature\nimportance analysis using SHAPley Additive Explanation (SHAP) that\nsupports the result of our study of input feature effect.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Muhammad Ridho Alhafiz": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/308910"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Ridho Alhafiz [23622014]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
