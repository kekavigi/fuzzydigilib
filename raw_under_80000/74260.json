{"Nomor": 74260, "Judul": "ANALYTICAL METHOD DEVELOPMENT FOR THE DETERMINATION OF NITRITE IN CHICKEN NUGGET USING UV-VIS SPECTROPHOTOMETER", "Abstrak": "Due to its ability to inhibit microbial growth, nitrite is commonly added into meat products as \npreservative. However, this food additive may be harmful to human health when its exposure exceeds \nits acceptable daily intake (ADI). This situation could occur when the concentration of nitrite in a food \nproduct is higher than the maximum level permitted by regulation. The aim of this research was to \nobtain an analytical method for determination of nitrite in chicken nuggets by means of visible \nspectrophotometry. The samples were prepared by means of extraction and precipitation methods to \nminimize matrix interferences during measurement. In the next step, nitrite was reacted with sulfanilic \nacid and N-1-napthyl-ethylenediaminedihydrochloride (NEDA) to produce a pink to magenta colored \nreaction product which absorbed visible radiation with the maximum wavelength of 546 nm. The \nmethod was validated based on various parameters including linearity, limit of detection (LOD), limit \nof quantification (LOQ), accuracy, and precision. Standard solutions of nitrites in the range of 0.133 ?\n1.200 ppm gave a linear calibration curve with the regression equation of Y = 0.5857X ? 0.0115 and R2\nvalue of 0.9969. LOD and LOQ of the method were 0.049 and 0.108 ppm, respectively. Accuracy testing\nresulted in percentage recoveries in the range of 94.705% - 110.799% with acceptance criteria from \n80% - 120%, while precision testing results expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD) within the \nrange of 0.209% - 8.473% with an acceptance criterion of RSD ? 11%. Application of this method to the \nreal sample resulted in nitrite level in the range of 0.040 ? 0.044 ppm which is below the LOD and LOQ \nvalues, therefore could be reported as not detected (ND). Based on overall results it was concluded, \nthat the method for the determination of nitrite in chicken nugget was successfully obtained, and the \nnitrite levels in the tested nugget sample were not more than the regulatory limit.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Vira Amanillah Rahmah": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/294854"}, "Penulis": "Vira Amanillah Rahmah [10719204]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. rer. nat.
