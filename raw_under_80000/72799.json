{"Nomor": 72799, "Judul": "NUMERICAL SIMULATION IN MODELLING THE LABORATORY SCALE OF DOUBLE DISC CUTTER EXCAVATABILITY USING THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL FINITE ELEMENT METHOD", "Abstrak": "Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) is generally used to excavate tunnels with circular cross section through variety\nof soil and rock strata continuously. Disc is the most commonly used as cutter in TBM today. There are several\nfactors that affect the performance of the disc cutter to work optimally, such as spacing between the discs. This\nstudy aims to determine the excavation capability of concrete by discs cutter with finite element method in RS3\nsoftware. Numerical simulations were carried out by varying five spacings between the discs, namely 12 mm, 17\nmm, 28 mm, 30 mm, and 33 mm. The parameters obtained from the model are strength factor depth (SF=1) as the\ndepth of penetration and the value of minimum principal stress (????3) as a proof of failure zone. The penetration\ndepth of 12; 17; 28; 30; and 33 mm is 2.85; 2.98; 3.89; 4.16; and 4.33 mm. The 33 mm spacing which has\nspacing/penetration ratio 7.62 is the most optimal ratio due to its lowest specific energy, that is 18,51 MJ/m3.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hayati Agustini [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Nuhindro Priagung Widodo and Tri Karian"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Mei 2023"}
