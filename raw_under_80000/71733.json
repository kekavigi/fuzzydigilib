Second , according to the derived element stiffness\nmatrix , the solution program for calculating thenatural frequency of multi-span uniform cross-section PC continuous box girder\nbridge with corrugated steel webs considering the influence of steel web shearing effect is compiled by MATLAB software. The\ncorrectness of the natural vibration frequencies calculated by the MATLA B software is verified by the measured frequency of the\nconstructed bridge and the calculated value by ANSYS 3 D FE method. Finally , the influence parameters of the bending vibration\nfrequency of the abovementioned bridge are analyzed. The result shows that ( 1) The natural frequencies calculated by the proposed\nprogram are in good agreement with the measured and FE values of the built bridges. The calculation program has higher\nprecision , the difference of the first 5-order natural frequencies is within 6. 01 % and 7 . 32 % . ( 2) The shear defomation effect of\ncorrugated steel webs has great influence on the natural frequency of the subject bridge, while the modification of the shear modulus\nof corrugated steel webs and the type of corrugated steel webs has little influence on the bending vibration frequency of the\nbridge , the difference of the first 5-order bending vibration frequencies is within 1. 07% and 0. 55%, which can be ignored.\n( 3) The dynamic analysis of the subject bridge considering the shear deformation effect can be easily incorporated into the matrix\ndisplacement system of the common framed structure, which avoids the complexity of the establishment and solution of the\nANS YS FE model , It provides a reference for the calculation and analysis of the bending vibration frequency of the bridge type.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "JI Wei [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["LUO Kui, MA Wan-liang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "bridge engineering; vertical bending vibration frequency; dynamic stiffness matrix; continuous box girder bridge ; princi pie of potential energy stationarity", "Sumber": "ASCE.LIBRARY", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Feb 2023"}
