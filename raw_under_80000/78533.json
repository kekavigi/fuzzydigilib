{"Nomor": 78533, "Judul": "HEAT TRANSFER AND MECHANICAL TEXTURE ANALYSIS OF GOAT SATAY", "Abstrak": "Indonesia has cultivated the culinary world with all kinds of dishes. From desserts to\nheavy meals, unique and diverse flavors are shared in Indonesia and across the globe. One of\nIndonesia\u2019s most famous dishes is called Sate. Sate is simply skewered meat grilled over\nburning charcoal. Typically, Sate is served with a generous bath of peanut sauce over them.\nWith Sate being around quite a while and its huge cultural value in Indonesia, very little\nresearch is done on analyzing the meat quality and to further improve it. Factors such as\ncooking duration, temperature, meat toughness, and texture play an important role for it to taste\ndelicious.\nWhen cooking, a Maillard Reaction is seen where both sugar and protein inside the\nmeat is cooked at high temperatures. This reaction gives the meat its distinctive flavor and\nbrowning to the meat. A two-bite test is done to assess the textural properties of the meat. The\ntextural properties include hardness, cohesiveness, springiness, and resilience.\nThe objective of this research is to develop a system that analyses from a heat transfer\nmodel of the meat whilst being cooked on a grill and assessing the textural properties of the\nmeat using the two-bite test. At the end, a comparison between the programmed model and the\nresult of the cooked meat is made.\nThe results of the simulation had an average cooking time of 338 seconds. In the other\nhand the experiment had an average cooking time of 328 seconds. The textural properties\nanalyzed are compared against the Carpathian goat meat. Differences of values are seen due\nto dimensions, temperatures, forces applied, and the distance travelled by the probe.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Andrew Nathan Kristianto [13118228]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Poetro Lebdo Sambegoro, M.Sc., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Mesin", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "heat transfer model, two-bite test, cooked, meat, sate", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "9 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Okt 2023"}
