Accurately determining the optimal interfacial tension is crucial for achieving an efficient recovery factor. Previous research by Huh (1979) proposed an equation for calculating IFT, but the equation did not align closely with laboratory test results for the region above the optimum salinity. In light of this, the objective of this study is to refine the Huh equation to estimate an IFT value that closely matches laboratory test results. Several factors are considered, including hydrophile-lipophile deviation (HLD), the range of the multiplier constant, and temperature. The study utilizes three surfactant samples (01A, 01B, and 01C) in its formulation. The findings of this study demonstrate that modifying the Huh equation in the upper optimum salinity range and conducting sensitivity analysis on the HLD multiplier factor lead to decreased errors. Moreover, the study provides valuable insights about surfactant dilution and the effect of injection of surfactant in high salinity, which provides many benefits for optimizing surfactant flooding. These findings contribute to understanding surfactant flooding and inform future research and application of surfactants for improved oil recovery in reservoirs with specific salinity conditions.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Nisrina Anis Millati": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/293450"}, "Penulis": "Nisrina Anis Millati [12219094]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Rani Kurnia, S.Si., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "surfactant, interfacial tension, Huh equation, upper optimum salinity, HLD, temperature.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Jun 2023"}
