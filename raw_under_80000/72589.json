{"Nomor": 72589, "Judul": "RISK ASSESSMENT OF COAL SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION PROPENSITY TO THE BUILDING AT IN-SITU CONDITION", "Abstrak": "Spontaneous combustion can occur in coal that has been crushed and the coal was Jound at in-situ conditions. In-\nSitu coal spontaneous combustion propensity caused by two main aspeci, namely: intrinsic factor (coal rank,\nPyrites and ash content, coal particle size, permeability of coal) and extrinsic factor (seam thickness, depth of\ncover and siructures & geological anomalies). This study was conducted to assess the risk of spontaneous\ncombustion in coal seams that will be used as a foundation of building. Risk assessment is performed by using a\ndeveloped risk matrix. To evaluate the risk, primary data were collected, i.e. : ultimate and proximate testing of\nsamples from coal seams, spontaneous combustion potential testing and modeling of coal seam structure.\n\nFrom the assessment method developed, it can be seen that intrinsically coal seams have the propensity for\nspontaneous combustion at the medium level. While extrinsic, the propensity for spontaneous combustion is at\n. high level. This shows that the risk of spontaneous combustion in coal seams is not only affected by the coal\nProperty (intrinsic), but also strongly influenced by extrinsic factors. A coal seam can have an intrinsically high\npotential for sSpontaneous combustion, but when at in-situ condition it has a low potential, and the opposite can\nalso occur. In this case, the method developed was capable to analysis such problems.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Ahmad Ihsan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289141", "2018 AHMAD IHSAN 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289142", "2018 AHMAD IHSAN 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289143", "2018 AHMAD IHSAN 1-PAPER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289144"}, "Penulis": "Ahmad Ihsan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Nuhindro P.
