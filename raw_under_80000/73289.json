{"Nomor": 73289, "Judul": "STUDY OF AQUIFER PROPERTIES EFFECT ON THE OPTIMUM NUMBER OF PRODUCTION WELLS USING MATERIAL BALANCE TANK MODEL", "Abstrak": "This study focuses on investigating the effect of aquifer properties and their influence on the optimum number of production wells using the material balance tank model. The research is conducted in both the X field and the Y field, which currently have three wells in the X field (X-1, X-2, and X-3) and one well in the Y field (Y-1).\nThe author employed a simulation methodology consisting of sequential steps of data input, model design, and parameter analysis to assess the impact of the aquifer on gas production. The data processing involved conducting simulations using the MBAL software on the wells. Four methods were utilized in the simulations: without aquifer, Hurst-van Everdingen-Modified (HVE), Fetkovich Steady State (FSS), and Carter-Tracy (CT). Microsoft Excel was used for plotting and analyzing the gas production data.\nFor sensitivity analysis, the author employed the Hurst-van Everdingen-Modified, Fetkovich Steady State, and Carter-Tracy methods. The chosen parameters for sensitivity analysis were Aquifer Permeability, encroachment angle, and outer/inner radius ratio. The Tornado diagram will be utilized to analyze the aquifer parameters that affect cumulative gas production in the wells. This diagram will provide a visual representation and facilitate the analysis of the aquifer parameters' impact on gas production.\nKeywords: Aquifer, Production, Sensitivity Analysis", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Muhammad Yaumil Sultan R": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/293204"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Yaumil Sultan R [12219011]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
