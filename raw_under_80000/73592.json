{"Nomor": 73592, "Judul": "EFEKTIVITAS MODEL ANGGARAN KESALAHAN VERTIKAL UNTUK SISTEM ECHO-SOUNDER MULTI-BEAM PORTABEL PADA SURVEI BATIMETRIK PERAIRAN DANGKAL", "Abstrak": "With the increasing availability of portable survey equipment and platforms, there are now multiple options for acquiring hydrographic data, depending on the devices and their installation methods. Typically, the installation of hydrographic survey devices is customized to fit the dimensions of the boat or platform. Given the wide variety of portable equipment on the market, each survey launched may have unique sensor offsets and device performance, making it essential to verify persistent accuracy performance.\nThis thesis explores the use of portable deployments of multibeam echosounder (MBES) on various survey boats. The study focuses on error budget modeling and field tests to determine the capability of MBES on different boats and devices configurations. A model is developed to estimate the propagating uncertainty from the sources of measurement uncertainties, mainly considering the vertical sources of error in MBES survey as they contribute the most to hydrographic data quality. To verify the model, field tests are conducted in two different locations using various boats and device configurations. The results show that the modeled uncertainties align with the measured standard deviations, especially in the Pramuka area, where the standard deviation is 0.25m compared to the predicted 0.28m at the widest beam angle of \u00b1 60\u00b0. However, there is a larger discrepancy in the Patimban area, where the model overestimates the uncertainty, predicting 0.27m uncertainty compared to the measured standard deviation of 0.17m. The verification indicates that the proposed model can independently identify survey quality in accordance with the International Hydrographic Organization standards, regardless of the options of devices and their installations. This thesis could be beneficial in assessing the vertical accuracy of any portable survey systems and helps hydrographic surveyors to design the best strategy for device selection and installation prior to carrying out the measurement.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Abubakar Aliyu Alhassan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/294057"}, "Penulis": "Abubakar Aliyu Alhassan [25121701]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr.rer.nat.
