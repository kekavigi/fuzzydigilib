ESP technology has evolved to handle gas presence, offering a compact footprint and suitability for low to high production rates. The well of this study, well ARM, has some problems like sand problem and extreme free gas production. In the case of well ARM, the ESP design incorporates 130 calculated stages (based on manual calculations) and 164 actual stages to accommodate the well's specific conditions. Each ESP operates at a frequency of 52 Hz (3120 rpm), aligned with the actual operating conditions. To ensure durability and minimize risks, NOVOMET's PMM with 2 poles (Permanent Magnet Motor) is utilized, providing a longer lifespan, and reducing the likelihood of overheating or premature failure. In conclusion, the research findings indicate that the well ARM encounters a significant amount of extreme free gas, constituting approximately 76% of the total fluid mixture under actual operating conditions. However, the proposed ESP design effectively addresses this issue, leading to an anticipated reduction in free gas production to around 32.5% under the best-case scenario. The ESP design includes two NOVOMET NFO150 ESPs arranged in a tandem configuration, equipped with a 2 poles Permanent Magnet Motor and an additional intake device to handle the presence of free gas. The selected stage configuration comprises 164 + 164 stages, with each pump operating at a frequency of 52 Hz (3120 rpm). Among the various intake devices considered, the gas separator emerges as the most suitable choice for the specific conditions of well ARM in Field X, Jambi. This is due to the superior flow rate of the well when equipped with a gas separator compared to other intake devices.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Albar Rafi Munthe": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/293223"}, "Penulis": "Albar Rafi Munthe [12219027]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wijoyo Niti Daton, S.T, M.T.", "Yudha Yulianto S.T.: Prasandi Abdul Aziz, S.Si., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "ESP, Free Gas, Permanent Magnet Motor, Intake Device", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Jun 2023"}
