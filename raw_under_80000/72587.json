{"Nomor": 72587, "Judul": "FUNDAMENTAL STUDY ON COMPARISON OF COAL COMBUSTION PRODUCTS (CCP) CHARACTERIZATION FOR ACID MINE DRAINAGE MANAGEMENT", "Abstrak": "Acid mine drainage (AMD) is an infamous environmental issue in mining that has an extensive and long-term impact when improperly managed. Numerous studies had been conducted to discover AMD management technigues that utilized wide ranges of material types to adeguately control AMD generation and mitigation. Past research has shown that fly ash (FA), as one of the coal combustion products (CCP), has the potency to be utilized as material used in AMD management. Several studies are developed to practically utilize FA in the mine site.\nHowever, those studies are site-specific, that utilize only one type of FA available near/around mine site. Due to different characteristics of FA in producing alkalinity to buffer pH, study of the type of FA is important to be conducted, especially because AMD problems in each mine is diversified depending on its acid producing capacity of sulfide minerals. Moreover, CCP also consist of bottom ash (BA) as by-produci aside of FA, in massive production. Study to compare the FA and BA characterization is also prominent to be conducted, in order to have\nbetter understanding and better utilization of CCP for AMD management.\n\nThis study aims to examine the potential of CCP utilization for AMD managemeni purposes by analyzing two different CCP from different coal deposit and operating temperature in coal burning. Static and kinetic test were carried out to understand alkalinity production in leachate water, therefore, the extensive capabiliry of CCP can be analyzed. The behavior of leachate water production from CCP were observed, thus the fundamental analysis on using those materials for AMD management can be understood. This study shows that CCP materials for both FA and BA, can provide alkalinity to leachate water in various range, highly depend on the chemical and geochemical properties of CCP. It is also seen that the heavy metals from FA and BA were insignificantly dissolved during kinetic test for more 70 days measuremeni, therefore the negative impact of CCP 10 the environment can be ignored in this system.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Rudy Sayoga Gautama": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289134", "2018 Rudy Sayoga Gautama 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289135", "2018 Rudy Sayoga Gautama 1-PAPER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289136"}, "Penulis": "Rudy Sayoga Gautama [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ginting Jalu Kusuma, Agus Haris Widayat, Sendy Dwiki, Abie Badhurahman and Hideki Shimada"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "3 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Apr 2023"}
