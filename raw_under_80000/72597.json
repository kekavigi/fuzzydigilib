{"Nomor": 72597, "Judul": "MODELING OF ACID MINE DRAINAGE TREATMENT DEVELOPMENT FOR MINE CLOSURE (CASE STUDY: ON2 AREA, LATI MINE OPERATION, BERAU COAL)", "Abstrak": "Coal is one of the primary energy commodities in Indonesia. With the development of coal mining activities, the\nenvironmental impacts caused will be more numerous and widespread. One of the environmental impacis of\nmining activities is the emergence of acid mine drainage and mining pit lakes, which, if not appropriately\nmanaged, will pose a danger to the surrounding community. This research aims to develop an integrated model\nof acid mine drainage for the mine closure area, 10 predict output water which complies with. Modeling results\nshow the applicability of passive treatment On ihe mine pit lake outlet to enhance the water guality. This option\noffers an increase in pH from 3.00 to 6.21 by mixing 504,000 m' of Northern ON2 pit lake water with 323,000 m3\nof Southern ON2 and East ON2 pit lake water which has been repaired and rainwater with a volume of 16,000\nm3. On the other hand, there was a significant decrease in Fe and Mn concentrations. The modeling result Shows\nihat Fe and Mn concentrations dropped by 7726 and 5996 in a single rainfall event. The alternative is deemed\nsufficient to produce expected efflueni water that meets regulatory water guality standards from the coal mine.", "Daftar File": {"COVER I K Dwika Paramananda": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289257", "2022 I K DWIKA PARAMANANDA 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289258", "2022 I K DWIKA PARAMANANDA 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289259", "2022 I K DWIKA PARAMANANDA 1-PAPER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289260"}, "Penulis": "I K Dwika Paramananda [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Rudy Sayoga Gautama, Ginting Jalu Kusuma, Sendu Dwiki, Sonny Abfertiawan, Abie Badhurahman, Firman Gunawan and Lionie C Butarbutar"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Teknik Pertambangan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani \u00a0\n                                     Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Apr 2023"}
