{"Nomor": 73976, "Judul": "COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS SIMULATION OF THORCON MOLTEN SALT REACTOR (MSR) NATURAL CIRCULATION LOOP: DETERMINATION OF OPTIMUM GEOMETRICAL PARAMETER AND EFFECT OF WORKING FLUID", "Abstrak": "ThorCon Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) converts fission heat to electricity through\nfour loops: a primary loop inside the can, a secondary salt loop, a solar loop, and a\nsupercritical steam loop. The secondary salt loop uses the natural circulation\nphenomenon inside a Natural Circulation Loop (NCL) to circulate coolant salt from\nthe primary heat exchanger to the secondary heat exchanger. Several studies on\nNCL Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation have been done in the\nrecent years, but none of those discusses the optimal geometrical design of the NCL.\nMoreover, flow modeling using molten salts as a working fluid is also yet to be\ndone previously. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the most optimum\ngeometrical parameters of NCL and investigate the effect of working fluid.\nThe simulation process started with constructing a 3D model by using Solidworks\n2023 Student Version. Secondly, the 3D model was meshed into smaller partitions\nusing Ansys Mechanical. After that, simulation setup was assigned into the meshed\nmodel with series of features in Ansys Student R2 2023 (Fluent). The first\nsimulation was carried out to validate the developed model by comparing\nsimulation results with available experimental data. The second simulation aimed\nto determine the most optimum geometrical parameters with considering hot leg\nlength, cold leg length, pipe inclination as the variables. Meanwhile, for the third\nsimulation, working fluid was varied to investigate the effects of working fluid.\nThe study on model validation demonstrated a deviation of 5.7% from the\nexperimental results obtained by Britsch et al.. Subsequently, a simulation for\ngeometrical optimization was conducted using the validated model, and it was\nfound that the FP8 design (1.34 m hot leg length, 1.66 m cold leg length, 72.97 pipe\ninclination) produced the highest average velocity for the molten salt. Thus, the FP8\ndesign was considered the optimal geometrical model, with average velocity of\n0.8661 m/s. The impact of the working fluid was analyzed using the FP8 design,\nand it was observed that FLiNaK salt exhibited the highest average salt velocity of\n0,09107 m/s.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Fauzi Rizky Ananda": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/294389"}, "Penulis": "Fauzi Rizky Ananda [12519027]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["D.Sc.(Tech.)
