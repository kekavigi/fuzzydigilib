To address this issue, artificial lift is used to create discharge pressure, allowing the reservoir to increase the fluid production rate as needed. The Y Field is considered a mature field since it has been producing oil for more than 70 years. Today, the daily production is approximately around 3,000 \u2013 4,000 barrels of oil per day. In this study, it focuses on one of the structures in Y Field, named X Structure. This structure is one of the main structures in Y Field with the daily production rate at number two among all structures. The artificial lift methods in the Y are Sucker Rod Pump and Electrical Submersible Pump. This study aims to evaluate and analyze the optimization of production in the X Structure. The focus of this study could be divided into two main parts, the well optimization, and the network simulation. The analysis and optimization of artificial lift and simulation of the surface network will be discussed as one of the ways to efficiently increase well production.\nPrior to the nodal analysis, the well schematic and artificial lift data is inputted to the software, continued by the construction of the Inflow Performance Relationship Curve. The nodal analysis is performed to observe the operating point of the well using a commercial software. After the nodal analysis, this study also intends to create the surface network simulation. The creation of surface network consists of the production well, injection well, pipeline, and gathering station. This study also performs the optimization scenarios for several wells that have potential and need lifting upsize, where the identification for the further optimized well was done using the quadrant mapping. Finally, the limit diagram is created to observe the ability of the surface facilities which consists of the oil tank, water tank, and group tank in the gathering stations in gathering fluid of newly proposed optimized case, where it is proven that the surface facilities\u2019 capacity can accommodate the optimized production. With an optimized production rate design, a production increase of 309.58 BOPD can be achieved.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Muhammad Irsyad Agung Ramadhan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/293404"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Irsyad Agung Ramadhan [12219089]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Steven Chandra, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Optimization, Artificial Lift, Production, Surface Network", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Jun 2023"}
