{"Nomor": 75207, "Judul": "THE EXTRACTION OF RARE EARTH AND RADIOACTIVE ELEMENTS FROM BANGKA MONAZITE USING SULFURIC ACID BAKING TECHNIQUE", "Abstrak": "The term rare earth elements (REE) represents the group of 17 chemically similar\nmetallic elements that consist of lanthanides with the addition of scandium (Sc) and\nyttrium (Y). REE are used in many advanced technologies. One of the most utilized\nminerals as REE resources is monazite (REPO4). In Indonesia, an appreciable\namount of monazite is available in Bangka Island as a byproduct of tin ore\nprocessing. There are several studies about monazite processing, but only limited\ninformation is available regarding the processing of Bangka monazite. Hence, this\nstudy aimed to investigate the processing of Bangka monazite ore to extract REE.\nThe sulfuric acid baking technique was used as it is currently the most common\ncommercial technology to process monazite.\nA series of acid-baking experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of\nsulfuric acid-concentrate ratio, baking temperature, and baking time on the\nextraction of REE, thorium (Th), and uranium (U). The experiment was performed\nby combining monazite ore (particle size <75 ?m) with concentrated sulfuric acid\nin a glazed porcelain crucible followed by baking in a muffle furnace. The baked\nmonazite was then subjected to water leaching at 70 \u00baC using a three-neck flask on\na hot plate equipped with a magnetic stirrer.\nThe experimental results showed that the extraction of REE, Th, and U increased\nwith an increasing acid-concentrate ratio. The highest extractions of REE (95.7%),\nTh (100%), and U (100%) were all achieved at the ratio of 3:1 with 200 \u00baC baking\ntemperature. Generally, the extraction of REE, Th, and U decreased as the\ntemperature increased in the range of 300\u2013500 \u00b0C. Meanwhile, the extraction of Th\ndecreased sharply from 72.46% at 300 \u00b0C, to 0.84% and 0.43%, at 400 dan 500 \u00b0C,\nrespectively. Furthermore, the REE extraction was also found to decrease from\n74.54% at 300 \u00b0C, respectively to 57,79% and 53,88% at 400 and 500 \u00b0C due to the\nformation of REE polyphosphate. The effect of baking time on the extraction was\nfound to be minor at the range of 1\u20132 hours, but notable changes were observed at\n2?3 hours of baking. The best parameter to digest Bangka monazite using the\nsulfuric acid baking technique was found to be at the acid-concentrate ratio of 3:1,\nthe temperature of 200 \u00b0C, and 3 hours of baking", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Mochammad Nandika Pratama": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/299934"}, "Penulis": "Mochammad Nandika Pratama [12519033]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["D.Sc.(Tech.)
