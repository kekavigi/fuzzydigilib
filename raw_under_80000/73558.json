{"Nomor": 73558, "Judul": "MODIFIED CRAIG-GEFFEN-MORSE (CGM) METHOD TO MODEL THE MECHANISM OF LOW SALINITY WATER INJECTION IN A HOMOGENEOUS RESERVOIR", "Abstrak": "Low Salinity Water Injection (LSWI) is widely used in the global oil industry for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) due to its operational simplicity, cost benefits, and environmental friendliness compared to other methods. However, the underlying mechanisms of LSWI are still debated, prompting the need for a more realistic model to simulate fluid displacement in reservoirs.\nThis study proposes the Craig-Geffen-Morse (CGM) method as an alternative approach to model low salinity waterflooding and reservoir fluid displacement. The study also investigates the impact of reservoir properties on oil recovery during low salinity water injection, considering factors such as pattern area, reservoir thickness, sand layer permeability, and fluid mobility ratio.\nUsing Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) codes in Microsoft Excel, the CGM method is implemented to calculate equations and correlations. The study conducts a sensitivity analysis to observe the effects of parameters on reservoir performance.\nThe results show that injecting fresh water may increase oil recovery by 11% compared to high salinity water injection. While water salinity data is not directly considered, the study demonstrates a clear relationship between reduced water salinity and improved oil recovery based on certain reservoir property conditions. Additionally, variations in pattern area and thickness have minimal impact on reservoir performance, yielding similar oil recovery factors. Sand layer permeability only affects oil recovery when high salinity water is used, and higher fluid mobility ratios significantly reduce oil production.\nThe findings align with previous research, supporting the applicability and practicality of the Craig-Geffen-Morse method for modeling low salinity water injection. These findings contribute to further development in this field.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Samuel Dacosta Lubis": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/293592"}, "Penulis": "Samuel Dacosta Lubis [12219083]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zuher Syihab, S.T, Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Low Salinity Water Injection, Craig-Geffen-Morse Method, Oil Recovery", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Jun 2023"}
