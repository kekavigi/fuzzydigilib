{"Nomor": 71745, "Judul": "ORGANOPHOSPHORUS COMPOUND FORMATION THROUGH THE OXIDATION OF REDUCED OXIDATION STATE PHOSPHORUS COMPOUNDS ON THE HADEAN EARTH", "Abstrak": "Reduced oxidation state phosphorus compounds may have been brought to the early Earth via meteorites or could have\nformed through geologic processes. These compounds could have played a role in the origin of biological phosphorus (P,\nhereafter) compounds. Reduced oxidation state P compounds are generally more soluble in water and are more reactive than\northophosphate and its associated minerals. However, to date no facile routes to generate C\u2013O\u2013P type compounds using\nreduced oxidation state P compounds have been reported under prebiotic conditions. In this study, we investigate the reactions\nbetween reduced oxidation state P compounds\u2014and their oxidized products generated via Fenton reactions\u2014with the\nnucleosides uridine and adenosine. The inorganic P compounds generated via Fenton chemistry readily react with nucleosides\nto produce organophosphites and organophosphates, including phosphate diesters via one-pot syntheses. The reactions were\nfacilitated by NH4 + ions and urea as a condensation agent. We also present the results of the plausible stability of the organic\ncompounds such as adenosine in an environment containing an abundance of H2O2. \nSuch results have direct implications on finding organic compounds in Martian environments and other rocky planets (including early Earth) that were richer in H2O2 than O2. Finally, we also suggest a route for the sink of these inorganic P compounds, as a part of a plausible natural P cycle and show the possible formation of secondary phosphate minerals such as struvite and brushite on the early Earth", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Maheen Gull  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Tian Feng, Joe Bracegirdle"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Origin of life \u00b7 Nucleoside phosphorylation \u00b7 Reduced oxidation phosphorus compounds \u00b7 Fenton chemistry \u00b7 Chemical evolution \u00b7 Macromolecules", "Sumber": "Springer", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Feb 2023"}
