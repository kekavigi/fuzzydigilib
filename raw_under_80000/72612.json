{"Nomor": 72612, "Judul": "STUDY OF HEATING EFFECT ON 200?, 400?, AND 600? GEOMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SANDSTONE AND THE APPLICATION OF UNDERGROUND COAL GASIFICATION", "Abstrak": "High-rank coal reserves are increasingly depleted due to the conventional mining and consequently underground\ncoal gasification (UCG) can serve as an alternative to uneconomically coal reserves i.e. low-rank, thin, and high\ndepth seam coal. Gasified coal will leave cavities in the coal seam and transfer heat around the rock mass. The\ninfluence of heat will affect properties of the rock mass which can disrupt underground stability.\nIn this research, sandstones are used as samples and heated in temperature of 200?, 400?, and 600?. These\nsamples are analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and scanning electron microscope\n(SEM) to examine the effect of heating to its mineralogy. Cavities as the result of gasification in coal seam are\nthen numerically modeled on Rock and Soil 2-D analysis software (RS2).\nFrom XRD and XRF analysis results, there are no major difference in the mineral composition and elements of\nthe sandstone samples before and after heated. There is considerable potential of instability on cavities after coal\nis gasified compared to ordinary cavities without the influence of heat.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Sukuanto Tanoto": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289519", "2017 SUKUANTO TANOTO 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289520", "2017 SUKUANTO TANOTO1-TABLE OF CONTENTS.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289521", "2017 SUKUANTO TANOTO 1-PAPER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/289522"}, "Penulis": "Sukuanto Tanoto [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Nuhindro Priagung Widodo, Rudy Sayoga Gauyama, Ginting Jalu Kusuma, Budi Sulistianto"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "03 Mei 2023"}
