{"Nomor": 72479, "Judul": "GEOTECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF DEVELOPMENT TUNNEL STABILITY AT LONGWALL MINE IN EAST KALIMANTAN", "Abstrak": "One of Indonesian longwall underground coal mining company located in East Kalimantan has already\ndeveloping a trial panel whose width is smaller than the planned width of the production panels. There are some\nsign of instability appear in the development tunnel. Geotechnical analysis was carried out to determine the cause\nof the instability and to provide supporting recommendations. The analysis was carried out on the cross-sectional\nline passing through the development tunnel that was indicated experiencing instability, namely Tailgate 1.5\n(TGI1.5). Simulations carried out on Tail-Gate 1.5 show that excavation of the longwall trial panel will have an\nimpact on ihe stability of ihe Tail-Gate 1.5 tunnel. This condition also has the potential to cause instability in the\nTail-Gate 1.5 development tunnel. It is recommended to sirengihen the support at ihe Tail-Gate 1.5 location which\nis near the trial panel collapsing zone by closing the space between the steel set. Maximum load of 2.1 tons have\nto be maintained so that the steel set does not failure. For steel set spacing can be set by 0.75 meters or 0.5 meters", "Daftar File": {"COVER Ali Husain TAHERDITO": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287225", "2022 ALI HUSAIN TAHERDITO 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287226", "2022 ALI HUSAIN TAHERDITO 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287227", "2022 ALI HUSAIN TAHERDITO 1-PAPER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287228"}, "Penulis": "Ali Husain TAHERDITO [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Budi SULISTIANTO, Tri KARIAN, Nuhindro Priagung WIDODO, Akhmad Ardian KORDA"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Mar 2023"}
