{"Nomor": 72500, "Judul": "EFFECT OF NORMAL STRESS ON DIRECT SHEAR TEST", "Abstrak": "Direct shear test is an experimental procedure conducted in laboratory that aims to determine the shear strength of soil or rock materials. Shear strength is defined as the maximum resistance that a material can withstand when subjected to shearing. The shear strength is one of the most important properties in geotechnical engineering. The direct shear test procedure involves applying a normal stress to the top of the sample prior to shearing. Then, a shearing stress is applied along the horizontal plane until the sample fails. The normal stress applied should not exceed the elastic limit of the material where the initial fracture formation may be occurred. This study was conducted mainly in laboratory to determine the effect of normal stress values on the shear strength characteristic. The direct shear tests were performed on sandstone. The normal stresses were given with varying values. The test results reveal that at a certain normal stress value, the relationship between normal stress and shear stress changes from initially linear to non-linear. The transition period was proposed as a limit value of normal stress should be applied in the direct shear test. The limit value of normal stress for sandstone in this study is 0.6 MPa or as much as 12.2% of its uniaxial compressive strength value.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Ganda Marihot Simangunsong": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287511", "2021 GANDA MARIHOT SIMAGUNSONG 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287512", "2021 GANDA MARIHOT SIMAGUNSONG 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287513", "2021 GANDA MARIHOT SIMAGUNSONG 1-PAPER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287514"}, "Penulis": "Ganda Marihot Simangunsong [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": [], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Mar 2023"}
