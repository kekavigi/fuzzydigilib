{"Nomor": 71750, "Judul": "CHARACTERIZATION OF 1,4-DIOXANE DEGRADING MICROBIAL COMMUNITY ENRICHED FROM UNCONTAMINATED SOIL", "Abstrak": "1,4-Dioxane is a contaminant of emerging concern that has been commonly detected in groundwater. In this study, a stable\nand robust 1,4-dioxane degrading enrichment culture was obtained from uncontaminated soil. The enrichment was capable\nto metabolically degrade 1,4-dioxane at both high (100 mg L?1) and environmentally relevant concentrations (300 ?g L?1),with a maximum specific 1,4-dioxane degradation rate (\nqmax) of 0.044 \u00b1 0.001 mg dioxane h?1 mg protein?1, and 1,4-dioxane half-velocity constant (Ks) of 25 \u00b1 1.6 mg L? 1. The microbial community structure analysis suggested Pseudonocardia species,\nwhich utilize the dioxane monooxygenase for metabolic 1,4-dioxane biodegradation, were the main functional species\nfor 1,4-dioxane degradation. The enrichment culture can adapt to both acidic (pH 5.5) and alkaline (pH 8) conditions and\ncan recover degradation from low temperature (10\u00b0C) and anoxic (DO < 0.5 mg L? 1) conditions. 1,4-Dioxane degradation of the enrichment culture was reversibly inhibited by TCE with concentrations higher than 5 mg L?\n1 and was completely inhibited by the presence of 1,1-DCE as low as 1 mg L?1. Collectively, these results demonstrated indigenous stable and\nrobust 1,4-dioxane degrading enrichment culture can be obtained from uncontaminated sources and can be a potential candidate\nfor 1,4-dioxane bioaugmentation at environmentally relevant conditions.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yuyin Tang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mian Wang, Cheng?Shiuan Lee, Arjun K.
