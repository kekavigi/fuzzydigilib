Firstly, 4D microgravity data are used to estimate density\nchanges for each reservoir layer using deconvolution technique supported by reservoir physical properties \nand volume of fluid injection and production. Secondly, the density change values resulted from the \ndeconvolution technique are applied for 3D simulation of a reservoir fluid flow. In this study, the 3D \nnumerical approximation of two-phase incompressible and immiscible problems derived from fluid flow\nformulation in conjunction with 4D microgravity formulation has been developed. The implication of gravity \neffect in fluid flow has been quantified by the 4D microgravity method. In addition, a 3D gravity forward \nmodeling program has been created to test the value of density changes resulted from the deconvolution and \nsimulation techniques. For case study, 4D microgravity measurement data at \u2018SS\u2019 oil Field, Central Sumatra,\nIndonesia, has been used. \u2018SS\u2019 oilfield is a multilayer sandstone reservoir and the depth of reservoir target is \napproximately 700 m. The result has shown that application of the 4D microgravity data in fluid flows \nmonitoring and simulating gives a better interpretation of reservoir fluid flow dynamics.", "Daftar File": {"C.2.a.3.2.
