{"Nomor": 78287, "Judul": "MODELLING AND SIMULATION OF PASSENGER HANDLING PROCESS IN AN AIRPORT IN COVID-19 PANDEMIC CONDITION DUE TO AIRBORNE TRANSMISSION", "Abstrak": "The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact on various industrial sectors,\nincluding the aviation industry. The airport as one of the instruments in the aviation industry\nis a place that has a potential for high level of COVID-19 transmissions. After being exhaled\nby an infected person, the virus can stay in the circulation until it gets eradicated through air\nventilations and other control measures, decays, deposits onto surfaces, or inhaled by\nsusceptible people in the room. Although the regulations state that anyone who is going to\ntravel long-distances have to be tested negative through PCR test, the very slim chance of the\ntest returning a false negative result imposes the risk of virus transmission in airports. The\nsimulation for this research, which consists of three interrelated parts, is developed in both\nExcel and MatLab. Data gathering for this research was done both by directly observing in\nthe research\u2019s object location, Terminal 3 Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, and through\nsecondary research. This research concludes that faster level of service contributes to smaller\nconcentration of COVID-19 circulating in the area, lessening the transmission level.\nFurthermore, the use of face masks for all passengers and the addition of an air filtration\nsystem can help reduce virus levels in the room as well.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Nisrina Mozza K.
