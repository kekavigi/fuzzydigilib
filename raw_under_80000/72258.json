{"Nomor": 72258, "Judul": "IMAGERY, INTUITION AND IMAGINATION IN QUANTUM PHYSICS EDUCATION", "Abstrak": "In response to the authors, I demonstrate how threshold concepts offer a means\nto both contextualise teaching and learning of quantum physics and help transform students\ninto the culture of physics, and as a way to identify particularly troublesome concepts\nwithin quantum physics. By drawing parallels from my own doctoral research in another\narea of contemporary physics\u2014special relativity\u2014I highlight concepts that require an\nontological change, namely a shift beyond the reality of everyday Newtonian experience\nsuch as time dilation and length contraction, as being troublesome concepts that can present\nbarriers to learning with students often asking \u201cis it real?\u201d. Similarly, the domain of\nquantum physics requires students to move beyond \u201ccommon sense\u201d perception as it brings\ninto sharp focus the difference between what is experienced via the sense perceptions and\nthe mental abstraction of phenomena. And it\u2019s this issue that highlights the important role\nimagery and creativity have both in quantum physics and in the evolution of physics more\ngenerally, and lies in stark contrast to the apparent mathematical focus and lack of opportunity\nfor students to explore ontological issues evident in the authors\u2019 research. By reflecting\non the authors\u2019 observations of a focus on mathematical formalisms and problem solving at\nthe expense of alternative approaches, I explore the dialectic between Heisenberg\u2019s highly\nmathematical approach and Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s mechanical wave view of the atom, together with\nits conceptual imagery, at the heart of the evolution of quantum mechanics. In turn, I highlight\nthe significance of imagery, imagination and intuition in quantum physics, together\nwith the importance of adopting an epistemological pluralism\u2014multiple ways of knowing\nand thinking\u2014in physics education. Again drawing parallels with the authors\u2019 work and my own, \nI identify the role thought experiments have in both quantum physics education\nand in physics more generally. By introducing the notion of play, I advocate adopting and\ncelebrating multiple approaches of teaching and learning, including thought experiments,\nplay, dialogue and a more conceptual approach inclusive of multiple forms of representation,\nthat complements the current instructional, mathematical approach so as to provide\nbetter balance to learning, teaching and the curriculum.\n\nEpistemological pluralism", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Andrew J.
