{"Nomor": 75078, "Judul": "GAS LIFT OPTIMIZATION WITH DEEP GAS LIFT (DGL) FOR WELL SID-01", "Abstrak": "lower section of tubing so the produced fluid will flow easier. It is suitable for offshore and deviated wells, such as SID-01 which has been produced with a gas lift system. The gas lift injection point of this well is located far from the perforation. Therefore, the DGL system is installed to deepen the injection depth and increase production without pulling out the tubing, which requires more time and cost.\nThe simulation and modeling of the study were conducted with commercial software to design and optimize the gas lift configuration so that the production of the well would be increased. By applying sensitivity analysis, the optimal depth and rate of gas lift injection were estimated based on the well's response to each parameter. Optimized gas lift design also takes consideration for the initial gas lift mandrel set up.\nAfter analyzing gas lift injection depth and rate, the optimal model with injection depth of 6800 ft.MD and rate of 3 mmstb/day will increase the oil production of the well by 69.2% with pressure drawdown increase of 65.6%.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Alfia Dian Nur Salma": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/299710"}, "Penulis": "Alfia Dian Nur Salma [12219063]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wijoyo Niti Daton, S.T, M.T.", "Prasandi Abdul Aziz, S.Si., M.T.", "Cio Cio Mario, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Gas Lift, DGL system, injection depth, production, optimization.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Jul 2023"}
