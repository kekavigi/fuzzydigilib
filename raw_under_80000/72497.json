{"Nomor": 72497, "Judul": "EVALUATION OF THE USE OF BLAST-INDUCED VIBRATION PREDICTORS IN OPEN PIT COAL MINE", "Abstrak": "The widely used blast induced vibration predictors from United State Bureau of Mines/USBM (Duvall & Fogelson, 1962), Ambraseys & Hendron (1968) and Langefors & Kihlstorm (1978) so called in this study as regression methods were compared with the artificial neural network (ANN) method. Using 423 blasting vibration monitoring data taken at open pit coal mine of PT Adaro Indonesia, the analysis results show that the ANN method gives better results than the regression method. Coefficient of determination (R2) and mean absolute error (MAE) for the USBM are 0.785 and 0.446; Ambraseys & Hendron are 0.789 and 0.438, and Langefors & Kihlstorm are 0.351 and 0.517, respectively. While the ANN method produces R2 and MAE values of 0.896 and 0.267. Multiple linear regression (MLR) test was performed for 7 selected parameters in the ANN method, including blast hole diameter, burden, spacing, hole depth, number of holes, amount of explosive charge per delay, and distance between blasting location and point monitoring. The MLR results show that the maximum explosive charges per delay and the distance are the two most significance parameters with a significance value of less than 0.05.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Ganda M.
