{"Nomor": 70315, "Judul": "NUMERICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF FINITE STRAIN ELASTO-VISCOPLASTIC MATERIAL MODEL WITH ANISOTROPIC YIELD CRITERIA AND TEMPERATURE SOFTENING BEHAVIOR FOR FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS", "Abstrak": "The use of metallic material is widespread in the modern world. In it various forms,\nmetals may exhibit various material behavior such as anisotropy and\nviscoplasticity. In design of engineering components, the ability to predict these\nbehaviors is important to assess material performance. Afdhal et. al. (2022) has\npreviously developed a constitutive model for assessing elasto-viscoplastic\nbehavior of sheet metals with anisotropy in small strain framework. In this thesis,\nthe constitutive model is slightly improved and implemented into finite element\nframework. This work aims to include temperature softening behavior and\nformulates the elasto-viscoplastic problem in finite strain. The implementation of\nelasto-viscoplastic using explicit return-mapping has been successful. To prove the\nusefulness of the developed model, it is used to simulate tensile test in various\nconditions and the results were compared with experiment. It shows good capability\nin predicting anisotropy, captures varying rates of viscoplasticity, and temperature\nsoftening at elevated temperatures.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Yeremia Kristianto": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/269859"}, "Penulis": "Yeremia Kristianto [23621015]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
