{"Nomor": 73754, "Judul": "IN VITRO EVALUATION OF SUN PROTECTION FACTOR (SPF) AND TYROSINASE INHIBITION ON SELECTED PLANT SECONDARY METABOLITES", "Abstrak": "Severe exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays leads to skin damages namely hyperpigmentation, freckles, \nmelanoma, age spots, and melasma which relate to skin pigment enzyme, tyrosinase. Prevention \ncan be done by averting harsh UV rays and inhibiting tyrosinase catalytic activity. Many compounds \nhave been developed for treatment of such diseases. However, most come with unwanted side \neffects. The purpose of this study was to determine sun protection factor (SPF) value and tyrosinase \nenzyme inhibitory activity of plant secondary metabolites with high antioxidant activity i.e., rutin, \ncatechin, niazirin, piperine, quercetin, and quercitrin as potential alternatives. Both tests were \ncarried out using UV-Vis spectrophotometry. SPF determination was done by observing the \nabsorbances through wavelength 290 to 320 nm. The determination of anti-tyrosinase activity was \ncarried out by measuring dopachrome at 490 nm after enzymatic reactions and calculating IC50. In \nSPF assay, benzophenone-3 as the standard, piperine, rutin, quercetin, and quercitrin showed high \nprotection ability with SPF above 30 at 500 ?g/mL. In tyrosinase inhibition assay, kojic acid as \nstandard showed strong potential of inhibition at IC50 33.65 ?g/mL. Whereas quercetin, rutin, and \npiperine gave weak potential of inhibition at IC50 178.44, 271.73, 347.62 ?g/mL. Quercitrin and \nniazirin showed little to no tyrosinase inhibition activity. While catechin is shown to catalyzes the \nreaction on tyrosinase enzyme more. To conclude, quercetin, rutin, and piperine have the potential \nto be developed as active ingredients to protect the skin from UV-induced damages through \nsatisfactory SPF values and tyrosinase inhibition activity.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Raihana Mufliha Fatharani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/294098"}, "Penulis": "Raihana Mufliha Fatharani [10719203]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Elfahmi, S.Si., M.Si.", "Dr. Amirah Adlia, S.Si., M.Si."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sains dan Teknologi Farmasi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Farmasi", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "sun protection factor (SPF), tyrosinase enzyme, anti-tyrosinase, plant secondary  metabolites, spectrophotometry", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Jun 2023"}
