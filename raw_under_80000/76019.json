One of the methods\nused to detect unstabilized approach is the energy management method.\nThe energy management method focuses on assessing the aircraft\u2019s energy\nstate within an ideal energy range during the approach phase. The energy\nmanagement model is influenced by the glide slope angle of the destination\nairport and the specific approach reference speed for each aircraft type,\nutilizing flight data from a single aircraft type landing at the same location.\nThe energy management method takes into account nine contributing factors\nto the outcome. Stochastic sensitivity analysis is conducted by varying inputs\nusing Monte Carlo simulations, where input variations are based on actual\ndata from 2073 flights collected through the Flight Data Monitoring (FDM)\nprogram. Sensitivity analysis is performed by introducing variations to the\ninputs in the energy management model. Input variations are applied to\neach factor contributing to unstabilized approach while keeping other factors\nconstant according to standard operational conditions represented by reference\nflights. Sensitivity levels are measured by ranking factors contributing to\napproach instability based on standard deviation and minimal-maximal range\nof energy outputs for each factor. More significant standard deviations and\nranges in energy outputs indicate higher sensitivity levels. Based on sensitivity\nanalysis results, the sequence of sensitivity levels for factors contributing to\napproach instability is as follows: altitude (h), pitch angle (?), groundspeed\n(v), angle of attack (?), engine thrust (N1), lift coefficient (CL), aircraft mass\n(m), air density (?), and coefficient of drag in zero-lift condition (CD0).", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Rafli Awlad Assyauqi [13619072]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Khairul Ummah, S.T., M.T.", "Dr. -Ing.
