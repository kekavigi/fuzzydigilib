{"Nomor": 72528, "Judul": "ANALYSIS OF SLOPE GEOMETRY EFFECT ON SLOPE STABILITY OF LATERITE NICKEL OPEN MINE WITH 3-DIMENSIONAL AND 2-DIMENSIONAL LIMIT EQUILIBRIUM METHOD IN STATIC AND DYNAMIC CONDITIONS", "Abstrak": "Slope stability analysis is generally conducted in 2 dimensions without considering the width of the slope, 3-\ndimensional slope stability analysis considers the width of the slope. Factor of safety calculation is carried out in\nlaterite nickel open mine by simulating variations in width, height, and slope angle to determine the ratio of width\nto height of the slope. This simulation is carried out under static and dynamic conditions, considering the seismic\nload. The type of failure analyzed in this study is circular, with Bishop limit equilibrium method (Bishop, 1954),\nand using Rocscience Slide2 and Slide3 for 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional analysis.\nThe analysis results show the width of the slope in 3-dimensional slope stability analysis greatly influences the FS\nvalue of limonite, saprolite, and bedrock materials. The 3-dimensional FS value is greater than the 2-dimensional\nFS value because the 2-dimensional analysis assumes that the slope width is unlimited, while the 3-dimensional\nanalysis is limited thus has different slip surface. The 3-dimensional analysis is more suitable for detailed slope\nanalysis due to the capability to model the rock lithology, slope geometry, and discontinuity more accurately than\n2-dimensional analysis. However, the 2-dimensional analysis is still needed for more general analysis.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Thedy Senjaya1": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287987", "2021 THEDY SENJAYA 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287988", "2021 THEDY SENJAYA 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287989", "2021 THEDY SENJAYA 1-ISBN.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287990", "2021 THEDY SENJAYA 1-PAPER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287991"}, "Penulis": "Thedy Senjaya1 [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Nuhindro Priagung Widodo and Muhammad Zaini Arief"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "slope stability, 3-dimensional factor of safety, limit equilibrium method, nickel", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "5 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Apr 2023"}
