Its main reservoir, the \nUpper Baturaja Unit carbonate contains most of the oil resources in Rama Field, \nyet, only 12% of these have been produced to date. Future water injection and redevelopment plans of this field, as the consequence, require detail analysis \nthrough static and dynamic approaches. This thesis focuses on the petrophysical \nrock type\u2013based static reservoir characterization through the identification of rock \ntype, its composition and distribution. Hence, the main goal to obtain a \ncomprehensive understanding of the petrophysical properties of the reservoir can \nbe achieved. \nCore data with a total length of 410 ft from four wells, 305 core plugs, each of \nthem is measured for its porosity and permeability and sampled for thin section \nanalysis, combined with 108 well data are used in this study. Facies, facies \nassociation and diagenetic history analyses are performed to understand the \ninfluence of facies, depositional environments and diagenesis to the development \nof petrophysical rock types (PRT). Petrographic analysis plays important role in \nthe identification of rock types through the observation of pore types, pore sizes \nand pore associations. Six rock types are identified, (1) PRT 1\u2013vuggy porosity and \nmoldic macropore association, (2) PRT 2\u2013mudstone micropore and moldic \nmacropore association, (3) PRT 3\u2013intergrain meso-macropore association, \n(4) PRT 4\u2013mudstone micropore and moldic mesopore association, (5) PRT 5\u2013\nmudstone micropore and intergrain micro-mesopore association, and (6) PRT 6\u2013\nmudstone micropore. \nThree-dimensional reservoir characterization through 3-D reservoir modeling is \nperformed for facies, PRT and PRT-constrained porosity and permeability models. \nThe modeling results show strong consistency between petrophysical properties \nand the underlying rock type models. High porosity and permeability values are \nmostly in association with reservoir quality rock types, those are PRT 1, PRT 2 \nand PRT 3. Reservoir quality evaluation reveals a strong relationship between the \ntypes, composition and spatial distribution of PRT and well\u2019s productivity. PRT \n1-dominated wells in majority exhibit high productivity (> 1,000 bfpd), PRT-2 \ndominated wells mostly show moderate productivity (500\u20131,000 bfpd), whereas \nthe low productivity wells (< 500 bfpd) are commonly dominated by PRT 3.", "Daftar File": {"Abstrak Suryadi Wibowo 22008040.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/292560", "Cover Suryadi Wibowo 22008040.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/292561", "Bab 1 Suryadi Wibowo 22008040.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/292562", "Bab 2 Suryadi Wibowo 22008040.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/292563", "Bab 3 Suryadi Wibowo 22008040.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/292564", "Bab 4 Suryadi Wibowo 22008040.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/292565", "Bab 5 Suryadi Wibowo 22008040.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/292566", "Bab 6 Suryadi Wibowo 22008040.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/292567", "Daftar Pustaka Suryadi Wibowo 22008040.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/292569", "Lampiran Suryadi Wibowo 22008040.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/292570"}, "Penulis": "Suryadi Wibowo [22008040]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
