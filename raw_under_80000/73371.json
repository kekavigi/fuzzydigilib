Concurrently, Indonesia is committed to reducing GHG (Greenhouse\nGas) emissions by a range of 29% to 41%. To attain these targets, the Indonesian government has initiated plans\nfor the implementation of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) as well as Carbon Capture, Utilization, and\nStorage (CCUS) technologies. The CCUS technology is the most viable solution for Indonesia to increase oil\nproduction and reduce GHG emissions, as CCUS can enhance the recovery factor from 5% to 15% and reduce\ncarbon emissions by 0.5 to 1.5 tons of CO2 per ton injected.\nThis study was conducted in oil field located in East Java, Indonesia, which features a carbonate reservoir. This\nstudy utilized CMG GEM 2021 to analyze the impact of CO2 injection rate and the location of injection\nperforations as crucial parameters influencing the effectiveness of CCUS implementation. This analysis\nencompassed a sensitivity study involving various CO2 injection rates and perforation locations within the gas\ncap, oil zone, and aquifer zones. The outcomes of this sensitivity analysis were evaluated based on oil recovery\nfactor, CO2 storage, and CO2 plume migration.\nThe study concluded that the CO2 injection rate has an almost linear relationship with the oil recovery factor.\nThus, higher rates of CO2 injection correspond to a more rapid horizontal migration of CO2 plume, thereby\ncovering a wider area. Consequently, a larger number of wells experience CO2 breakthrough, resulting in\nreproduction of CO2 alongside oil and gas production. Furthermore, concerning the sensitivity analysis of\nperforation location, the highest oil recovery factor was observed in the oil zone perforations, reaching to\n38.37%. This can be attributed to the increased contact between CO2 and oil within this zone. Conversely, the\nmost effective location for CO2 storage was found to be the aquifer zone perforations, primarily due to the\nsubstantial CO2 trapped via residual and solubility trapping mechanisms, which are considered safer than\nstructural trapping. The perforation location also influences the migration of CO2 plume, as there are variations\nin horizontal and vertical permeability across the different perforation zones. The CO2 plume tends to migrate\nthrough layer with higher permeability.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Putri Diyanadira": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/293315"}, "Penulis": "Putri Diyanadira [12219057]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
