{"Nomor": 72615, "Judul": "REDESIGNING ROLLER IN A 1:5 SCALED ROLLER RIG FOR RAILWAY BOGIE DYNAMICS TEST", "Abstrak": "Indonesia has been independently making an effort in developing our own technology\nand infrastructure for high-speed train. To design a new railway bogie, a comprehensive analysis\nfollowed by a series of testing is required. One of the processes to ensure smooth operation is\nby evaluating the wheel-to-rail contact mechanics and dynamics of the railway vehicles\nthemselves using a roller rig. The objective of this study is to detect forces occurring on the\ncontact points using strain gauges on the rollers. It aims to provide preliminary data for future\nanalysis of the wheel-rail interaction using a 1:5 scaled roller rig.\nThis study consists of redesigning the roller's thickness or even the design itself, such as\nthe addition of holes on the roller body, which will be modelled utilizing Solidworks software.\nConsequently, this change should still maintain and preserve the strength of the roller so the\nstudy can be conducted without any inaccuracies in the simulation. ANSYS software will be\nused to construct the roller finite element model and conduct the load simulation. The optimal\npositions of the sensors will also be determined using the load simulation results from bogie\nframe and wheelset to the roller which then allows generation of various strain readings.\nIn this final project, strain characteristics of the roller in the 1:5 scaled roller rig will be\nanalysed by previously determining the best design of the roller to conduct force measurement,\nthe optimal strain measuring points and the configuration of strain gauges as sensors in the\nwheatstone bridge positioned on the roller.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "I Gusti Ayu Shintya Muliarta [13118233]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yunendar Aryo Handoko, S.T, Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Mesin", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "high-speed train, roller rig, redesign, roller, strain, strain gauge", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Mei 2023"}
