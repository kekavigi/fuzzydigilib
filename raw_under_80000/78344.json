{"Nomor": 78344, "Judul": "CFD BASED PARAMETRIC STUDY OF TRUNCATED GEOMETRY AND ALTITUDE ON AEROSPIKE NOZZLE PERFORMANCE", "Abstrak": "With the rise of commercial space launching companies and the commercialization\nof space, cost effective measure are in pursue to make it as affordable as possible. One\nof which are designing a rocket that is efficient throughout the flight path and could\nhandle all conditions without being too complex. This could be achieved with the use\nof altitude compensating nozzle such as aerospike nozzle. Aerospike nozzle is a nozzle\nthat utilizing the atmospheric pressure to develop the flow by utilizing flow that expands\nafter the nozzle throat. These expansion fans are controlled by the nozzle with a ramp\ngeometry by the use of Angelino\u2019s theory to reach the desired exit velocity based on\nthe throat conditions and would have the same exit velocity throughout the flight path\nin an under-expanded conditions.\nThe biggest weakness of the nozzle is heat management as the spike tapered off\nalong the length of the nozzle, this could be mitigated by truncating the nozzle at a\nvarious percentage of area in the design. By truncating the spike, the expansion fan\nwould have a different exit velocity with the same throat properties. Thus, the design\nof this study will follow the fixed exit mach number of 2.4 and the throat condition\nwould follow those criteria. The difference in throat condition would be mitigated by\nthe use of specific impulse as a point of comparisons between the designs as it accounts\nfor the mass flow rate on the inlet. The design and analytical thrust calculation would\nbe aided by MATLAB and the result of those geometry would be simulated in ANSYS\nenvironment by using ICEM CFD, and ANSYS CFX.\nIt can be concluded that by choosing an exit mach number as a design point, the\nthrust and throat conditions would vary depending on the design and it only can be\ncompared if the comparison is using specific impulse as the comparative variable. From\nthe truncation variations also concluded that, a large truncation decreases thrust and\nspecific impulse significantly at on-design conditions and more capable to harness more\nthrust at higher pressure ratio and truncation is only viable in the smaller range (Below\n50%) with the on-design conditions.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Lucky Witjaksono [13617113]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ema Amalia, S.T, M.T.", "Dr. Ing.
