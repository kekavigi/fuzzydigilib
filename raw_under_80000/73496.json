{"Nomor": 73496, "Judul": "ANALISIS POLA DISTRIBUSI JALAK BALI (LEUCOPSAR ROTHSCHILDI) DI AREA CEKIK, RESORT GILIMANUK, SPTN I JEMBRANA, TAMAN NASIONAL BALI BARAT", "Abstrak": "Bali starling is endemic to the Province of Bali, Indonesia and has become an icon and attraction of Bali. Unfortunately, bali starling is categorized as one of Critically Endangered spesies in the IUCN Redlist. Cekik Area, Gilimanuk Resort, SPTN I Jembrana, TNBB is one of the habitats for the Bali starlings. Unfortunately, the location of this area is very close to human activities, posing a potential threat of anthropogenic disturbance, so research is being carried out in this area. Bird observations were carried out using the point counting method at 36 points, purposive sampling was carried out on the preferred vegetation of Bali starlings, and orthophoto data were taken using DJI Phantom 4 Pro, all three of which were processed into environmental variable data. Six environmental variables were analyzed with the aim of finding the relationship between supporting vegetation, competing and supporting species, and anthropogenic disturbance (human activity) on the distribution pattern of Bali starlings. Diversity and evenness indices were calculated to see dominance, and its relation to competing and supporting species of the Bali starling. The results showed that the Bali starlings were distributed in areas with moderate canopy cover, in areas where their competitor species were located, close to kesambi, close to hollow lontar, close to human activities, but far from their supporting species. In areas where Bali starlings are found, woodpeckers are not found as a supporting species for Bali starlings, because their distribution is suppressed by the dominant species. In addition, a strong relationship between Bali starling density and distance from human activity indicates anthropogenic disturbance, causing changes in the behavior of Bali starlings which tend to approach areas of human activity to look for food. This behavior may be caused by human activity which leaves organic waste in the form of food scraps, which then becomes an alternative food for Bali starlings, which are omnivores. Furthermore, the conservation behavior of Bali starlings by providing food outside their habitat can lead to dependence on humans by Bali starlings.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Daniel Wicaksono [11519022]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ichsan Suwandhi, S.Hut., M.P.", "Aditya Dimas Pramudya, S.Si., M.Si."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Rekayasa Kehutanan", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Ilmu dan Teknologi Hayati", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Bali starling, kesambi, perforated lontar, competitor species, supporting species.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan \u00a0\n                                     Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Jun 2023"}
