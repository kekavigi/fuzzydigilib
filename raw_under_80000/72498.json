{"Nomor": 72498, "Judul": "SELECTION OF BLASTING DESIGN USING AHP-TOPSIS", "Abstrak": "Blasting is one of the important activities in mining activity. Improper blasting design can lead to undesirable things, such as poor fragmentation, fly rock, ground vibration, and air blast values that exceed quality standards. To choose the optimal blasting design, various aspects need to be considered, such as technical, environmental, safety, and economic aspects. The choice of blasting design by considering many criteria can be done using the multi-criteria decision-making method. In this paper, first, the pairwise comparison of the AHP method is used to determine the weight of each criterion. In the second step, the TOPSIS method is used to rank various blast designs and determine the most optimal and suitable blasting design at PT Indocement Tunggal Prakarsa, Indonesia by considering the value of fragmentation, fly rock, ground vibration, air blast, and powder factor. The results of this study indicate that the blasting design with a hole diameter of 4 inches, burden of 3.5 m, spacing of 5 m, stemming 3.19 m, subdrill 1 m, and a hole depth of 17 m is the most optimal and suitable blasting design for PT Indocement Tunggal Prakarsa, Indonesia.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Auaradha Shukura Muji": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287497", "2022 AUARADHA SHUKURA MUJI 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287498", "2022 AUARADHA SHUKURA MUJI 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287499", "2022 AUARADHA SHUKURA MUJI 1-PAPER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287500"}, "Penulis": "Auaradha Shukura Muji [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ganda Marihot Simangunsong and Ridho Kresna Wattimena"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Mar 2023"}
