{"Nomor": 73444, "Judul": "ENHANCING INFILL WELL PLACEMENT & PERFORATION CANDIDATE IN MULTI-LAYERED RESERVOIRS THROUGH VORONOI DIAGRAM", "Abstrak": "This study focuses on enhancing infill well placement and perforation candidate selection in multi-layered reservoirs through the utilization of Voronoi diagrams. The primary objectives of this study are to integrate Voronoi diagrams with reservoir characterization techniques, determine the oil in place (OIP) through volumetric calculations, and investigate the potential benefits and novel contributions of this approach to the petroleum industry.\nThe methodology employed in this study involves data collection, Voronoi area calculation, and OIP estimation. The Voronoi diagrams are generated based on well coordinates and modified to account for the actual reservoir boundaries. The infill well placement and perforation candidate selection are conducted iteratively, ensuring that the area calculations are updated following the determination of infill well locations. The OIP calculations are performed by integrating the available data with the area collected from the Voronoi diagrams.\nThe results and observations obtained from this study demonstrate the potential of using Voronoi diagrams for infill well placement and perforation candidate selection. Through the application of this methodology, it was found that strategic infill well placement can significantly impact the estimated OIP. Additionally, the workover operation on an existing well showed a notable increase in the in-place volume following the implementation of perforations in specific layers.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Muhammad Wildan Anis Rahmani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/293403"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Wildan Anis Rahmani [12219087]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Dedy Irawan, S.T, M.T.", "Pahala Dominicus Sinurat, S.T, M.Sc., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Infill Well Placement, Voronoi Diagram, Multi-Layered Reservoir, OIP Estimation", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Jun 2023"}
