The strength of jointed rock mass can be increased by cement injection. An artificial rock sample made from dental plaster type of moldano tara is used in this study to evaluate the influence of cement injection to the strength of jointed rock sample. The roughness of joint surface are obtained from the natural rock joints and divided into three groups of Joint Roughness Coefficient (JRC) values based on Barton criteria. The injection materials are mixture of cement and water with the ratio of water and cement of 4: 5 and 3: 2. This artificial samples are then subjected to direct shear tests. The test results are analyzed by Mohr-Coulomb criterion to obtain the cohesion and internal friction angle. It is revealed that cohesion and internal friction angle increased for injected rock sample. The strength increase varies by JRC condition. For Sample with JRC value between 8-10, the study find that injection material with water to cement ratio of 4:5 is more effective than cement injection with ratio of 3:2. For JRC value between 12-14, 16-18, and 18-20, it is found that cement injection with ratio of 3:2 is more effective than 4:5.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Rizto Salia Zakri": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287705", "2018 RIZTO ZALIA SAKRI 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287706", "2018 RIZTO ZALIA SAKRI 1-PAPER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287707"}, "Penulis": "Rizto Salia Zakri [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ganda Marihot Simangunsong, Nuhindro Priagung Widodo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "3 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Apr 2023"}
