{"Nomor": 78553, "Judul": "COMPARISON OF SEQUENTIAL EXCAVATION METHODS FOR LARGE CROSS-SECTION TUNNEL", "Abstrak": "This paper compares sequential excavation methods for a large cross-section twin-tunnel in soft\nground condition, speci?cally, the Yogyakarta-Bawen highway twin tunnels. The tunnels are horseshoe-\nshaped with the dimension of 20.18 m x 13.7 m and under a maximum cover depth of only 32 m to tunnel\nroof. Based on an analysis of three sequential excavation methods, the side drift method yields the most\neffective way of controlling the roof settlement (3 cm) compared to the three-bench seven step method (6 cm)\nand the combination of side drift and top-heading and bench method (5 cm). The side drift method also\ngenerates the arch ef feet close to the excavation perimeter, resulting in a strength factor of more than 1.5 at the\nwall and roof of the tunnel, while at the same time minimizing the plastic zone thickness to only 2 m at the\ninvert.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Simon Heru Prassetyo": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/315609", "2022 SIMON HERU PRASETYO 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/315610", "2022 SIMON HERU PRASETYO 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/315611", "ABSTRAK Simon Heru Prassetyo": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/315612"}, "Penulis": "Simon Heru Prassetyo [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ridho Kresna Wattimena, Rexy Timothy Motoh, Fariz Aditya, Hafid Fahrudinsyah, Annisa Renaningtyas Tadiyana, Edy M Arsadi, Setiawan, Oemi Vierta Moerdika and A.
