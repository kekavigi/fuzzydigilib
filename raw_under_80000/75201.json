In this study, we conduct sensitivity analysis of wormhole propagation models in carbonate fields using two different propagation models, namely the Volumetric Model and the Buijse-Glasbergen Model. This study focuses on the effect of acid concentration and temperature on the two wormhole propagation models used. In this study, several variations of acid concentration and temperature were tested to understand how changes in these parameters can affect several important factors in acidizing, including wormhole penetration length, skin factor, and flowrate. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that acid concentration and temperature significantly affect the wormhole propagation characteristics in acidizing, both in the Volumetric Model and the Buijse-Glasbergen Model. Changes in acid concentration and temperature are shown to have an impact on the wormhole penetration length, where an increase in acid concentration and temperature tends to increase the size of the wormhole formed. Sensitivity analysis also revealed that, changes in acid concentration and temperature can affect the skin factor value, increasing acid concentration and temperature can reduce the skin factor value, which illustrates the improvement of fluid flow quality around the wormhole and well. In addition, the sensitivity analysis results show that the acid concentration and temperature also have an impact on the flowrate during the acidizing process. The variation of these parameters can affect the efficiency of acid injection into the carbonate formation and the overall result of the acidizing process.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Rifki Helmansyah": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/299928"}, "Penulis": "Rifki Helmansyah [12219010]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ardhi Hakim Lumban Gaol, S.T., M.Sc., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Acidizing, Volumetric Model, Buijse-Glasbergen Model, Wormhole Penetration Lengthe, Skin Factor, Flowrate.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Jul 2023"}
