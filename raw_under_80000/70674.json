{"Nomor": 70674, "Judul": "COAL SUPPLY OPTIMIZATION FOR INDONESIAN COAL-FIRED POWER PLANTS WITH BLENDING AND NON-BLENDING SCENARIOS", "Abstrak": "The economic growth of West Kalimantan Province is predicted to increase to 6.246 in 2026 and will affect the\nelectricity demand in West Kalimantan Province. At present, power plants in West Kalimantan are dominated by\noil-fired power plants. To meet its electricity needs, since 2016 PLN has imported electricity from Sarawak,\nMalaysia. This condition is predicted to continue until 2020. To reduce the level of dependence on imported\nelectricity and to reduce the basic costs of oil-fueled power plants, according to the 2017-2026 RUPTL document,\ncoal-fired power plants will be built, one of which is the Kalbar-2 PLTU 2x100 MW capacity. However, until\nnow coal resources in the Province of West Kalimantan are still not mined, so coal needs to be imported from the\nProvince of South Kalimantan and / or Sumatra Island. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize coal supply from\nSouth Kalimantan and or Sumatra Island to obtain coal needs in accordance with the capacity of the Kalbar-2\nPLTU with the minimum coal procurement costs. In addition to fulfilling a sustainable coal supply, scheduling is\nneeded to supply coal from Kalbar-2 PLTU from coal mine sources. Optimization of coal supply and scheduling\nis carried out using the linear program method. In this study, there are 62 types of coal from 25 companies in\nSouth Kalimantan and Sumatra Island which will be selected to supply coal to the Kalbar-2 PLTU. Optimization\nis based on two scenarios, namely the blending process as the first scenario and without the blending process as\nthe second scenario. For the first scenario the coal supply has the following characteristics: Calorie Value 3,440\nkcal / kg GAR, Total Moisture 40.884 AR, Total Sulfur 0.334 AR, and Total Ash 7.139c AR. The total coal\nreguirement is 28,152,240 tons with coal procurement costs of US $ 645,606,660. Whereas for the second scenario\nthe optimization results show the supply of coal with a Calorie Value of 5,300 kecal / kg GAR, Total Moisture\n3590 AR, Total Sulfur 0.759o AR, and Total Ash 84 AR. The total coal reguirement is 18,284.504 tons with coal\nprocurement costs of US $ 1,083,174,064.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Aryo Prawoto Wibowo": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/272077", "2018 ARYO PRAWOTO WIBOWO 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/272078", "2018 ARYO PRAWOTO WIBOWO 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/272079", "2018 ARYO PRAWOTO WIBOWO 1-PAPER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/272080"}, "Penulis": "Aryo Prawoto Wibowo [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Fadhila Achmadi Rosyid, Firly Rachmaditya Baskoro, Yusef Pany"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "coal, PLTU (Coal-fired Power Plant), optimization, linear programming.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani \u00a0\n                                     Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Jan 2023"}
