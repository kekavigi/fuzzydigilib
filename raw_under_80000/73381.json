{"Nomor": 73381, "Judul": "UTILIZING PERMANENT MAGNET MOTORS TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF ESP IN EXTREME WELL CONDITIONS", "Abstrak": "The incorporation of Permanent Magnet Motors (PMM) in Electrical Submersible Pump (ESP) systems as a\nmeans to increase efficiency and decrease energy consumption has garnered considerable attention. This study\nexamines the integration of PMMs in ESP systems, notably in the context of two wells, TM-025 and TM-027,\neach of which presents unique production challenges. TM-025 confronts sand production issues, while TM-027\nfaces gassy oil well troubles. The primary objectives of this study are to design ESP systems with PMMs, compare\ntheir performance to that of Induced Motors (IMs), and evaluate the impact of the number of poles in PMMs using\nsensitivity analysis. To accomplish these objectives, simulation-based sensitivity tests are conducted to analyze\nnodal behavior and identify optimal operating points along the pump performance curve. This study includes the\nselection of ESP pumps, a comparison of the use of PMMs and IMs, and an examination of the effect of the\nnumber of poles in PMMs on system performance. The study proposes specific ESP pump configurations for each\nwell based on the conducted analyses. Incorporating a PMM with two poles is advantageous for TM-025, which\nemploys an NHV(790-1000)H pump with 73 stages, a frequency of 60 Hz, and a flow rate of 470 BFPD. For TM-\n027, however, an NFV230 pump with 268 stages, a frequency of 50 Hz, and a flow rate of 21 BFPD along with a\nPMM with two poles is recommended. These results contribute to the comprehension of PMM utilization in ESP\nsystems and offer insights for optimizing production efficiency.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Febrian Haholongan Batistuta S": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/293327"}, "Penulis": "Febrian Haholongan Batistuta S [12219065]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wijoyo Niti Daton, S.T, M.T.", "Prasandi Abdul Aziz, S.Si., M.T.", "Yudha Yulianto, S.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "ESP, Permanent Magnet Motor, Nodal Analysis, Poles Number", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Jun 2023"}
