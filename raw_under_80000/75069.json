{"Nomor": 75069, "Judul": "COILED TUBING GAS LIFT OPTIMIZATION OF VARIOUS PRODUCTION CASE IN \"M\" FIELD EAST KALIMATAN", "Abstrak": "Mature fields are usually faced with challenges when reservoir pressure is insufficient to produce fluids naturally, necessitating the use of artificial lift methods. Coiled tubing gas lift (CTGL) is a single-point injection method in which gas is injected through coiled tubing in monobore or tubing cemented wells. This study focuses on analyzing and investigating the optimum gas lift injection rate in the \"M\" field, East Kalimantan. In this case, the optimum gas lift injection rate changes as the parameters recorded on the surface are changed along the production lifetime, such as the water cut, gas oil ratio, tubing head pressure, and other parameters. The problem is the changing pattern of the optimum gas injection rate cannot be identified so that the oil does not produce at the optimum rate. By comparing the gas lift performance curve generated from steady-state production modeling and production test data, the trend of changes can be identified, enabling adjustment of the optimum gas lift injection rate. Additionally, a proposed plan workflow is developed to optimize gas lift injection rate. This workflow has demonstrated its effectiveness in accurately predicting changes in the optimum gas injection rate, achieving a 67% accuracy based on the data utilized in this study.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Muhammad Inwan Kusuma": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/299699"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Inwan Kusuma [12219050]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Steven Chandra, S.T., M.T.", "Ibrahim Kunto Baskoro, S.T., M.SE."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Coiled Tubing Gas Lift, Gas lift performance curve, Optimum condition, Gas lift injection rate, production.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Jul 2023"}
