{"Nomor": 76493, "Judul": "ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ACTIVITY TEST OF HERMETIA ILLUCENS LARVA EXTRACT AND HYDROLYSATE", "Abstrak": "In several recent research, BSF larva have been potential in possessing vast bioactive compounds \nthat can provide diverse bioactivities, such as antimicrobial, antihypertensive, antioxidant with a \npossible beneficial impact on human health. Considering the profound benefits it offers, this study \naimed to explore anti-inflammatory activities black soldier fly larvae extract and hydrolysate. The \nBSF Larvae extracts obtained from the extraction and fractionation process were tested for its antiinflammatory activity and was analyzed by UV spectrophotometry at detectable wavelengths \nobtained from various optimization and trials. The results of the anti-inflammatory activity test \nduring the experiment showed that the BSF aqueous extract samples with concentrations of 50, 64, \n128 and 256 ppm had an inhibitory effect of 39.243%, 45.154%, 61.466% and 69.504%, respectively. \nThe IC50 obtained from the water extract is 129.326 ppm. Peptides are suspected to be present in \naqueous extract samples without hydrolysis treatment through thin layer chromatography analysis. \nAnti-inflammatory activity is present in the aqueous extract of BSF larvae.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Hisyam Ihza Muttaqien": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/303447"}, "Penulis": "Hisyam Ihza Muttaqien [10719208]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. apt.
