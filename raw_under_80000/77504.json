Vertical landing of a rocket booster is a new technology where the parameter of control input for landing is still unknown. Thus, to ensure a safe landing of the booster, comprehensive investigation of control strategies are imperative. This study employs open-loop and closed-loop linear simulations, as well as non-linear simulations, to explore attitude and guidance control during the vertical landing phase by linearizing the equation of motion and aerodynamic characteristics, also employing thrust vectoring control in the longitudinal direction to determine linear equation in 6 control points. The result of attitude control in closed-loop linear simulation shows that the system could stabilized. A closed-loop system of guidance control cannot track the flight path properly on 4 out of 6 control points. A non-linear simulation shows that the rocket cannot land at the specified location however it can stabilize itself and can land in almost upright position. Therefore, the chosen strategy by 6 control points based on velocity can be used for attitude and guidance control during landing phase. As demonstrated, the overdamped system might be the preferable strategy as seen from the flight path and trajectory comparison with the reconstruction of telemetry data.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Irsyad Rabbani [13619122]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Yazdi Ibrahim Jenie, S.T, M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Falcon 9, Vertical Landing, Thrust Vectoring Control, Linear Simulation, Non-Linear Simulation", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Sep 2023"}
