{"Nomor": 74939, "Judul": "UNSUPERVISED FRAMEWORK DESIGN FOR TEXT-BASED SAFETY ANALYSIS", "Abstrak": "The air transportation industry's growth aligns with the number of safety reports\nsubmitted. With over 50% passenger increase in the past 16 years, accurately\nanalyzing a high amount of safety reports is necessary. Narrative safety report data\nremain unexplored where hidden insights may lie inside those data. NASA ASRS\ndata are an example of aviation safety narrative data publicly available with a\nvoluntary reporting system.\nExploring enormous amounts of data will be tedious if a human does it. It is\nnecessary to use machine learning methods for exploring the narrative safety report\ndata. Natural language processing can be utilized to extract text data using a\ncomputer. Unsupervised learning can be applied to text narrative data to\nautomatically explore hidden insights useful for safety experts. This study aims to\ndevelop an explorative framework for analyzing the aviation safety narrative data\nto achieve a high-level view of the data. The framework is evaluated and\ndemonstrated in a study case using NASA ASRS Boeing data from 2012-2021.\nUsing Latent Dirichlet Allocation to perform topic modeling, the reports clustered\ninto four main topics. The topics are then presented with a cloud-synchronized\ndashboard to give an upper-level view of the documents.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Eduardo Imanuel Bastian [13619055]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Khairul Ummah, S.T., M.T.", "Dr. -Ing.
