From January 2021 until October 2022, the company\u2019s trading rice \ncategory product sales generated a negative profit. Even though for the last several years e-commerce has been focused \non growth instead of profitability, the current economic environment is forcing e-commerce companies to focus on \nprofitability as well. For trading products, maximum profit can be achieved in two ways: selling products with a very \nhigh margin but with less quantities or selling in large quantities but with a sub-optimal margin. Hence, the company \nneeds to find maximum profit that can be created by an optimal combination of price and quantity. To find the \nmaximum profit, the researcher first created a demand function by using Gradient Boosted for every product group \nwhich is already grouped based on their Unit of Measurement. Next, to find the optimal price point that generates the \nbest profit, the researcher used heuristic method against each of the demand functions. This method resulted in an \nincreased profit up to 975% from the actual negative profit at 8.5 billion Rupiah. Although this model successfully \ngave price recommendation which results in better profit, business context still needs to be added before this model \ncan be implemented in real life as well as finding other features that might affect the demand function.", "Daftar File": {"2023_TS_PP_Vinsensia Fresian Meiliana_29121204_Full Thesis.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/319952"}, "Penulis": "Vinsensia Fresian Meiliana [29121204]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Taufik Faturohman, S.T, MBA, Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Magister Bisnis dan Administrasi - Teknologi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Subjek": "General management", "Kata Kunci": "Price Optimization, Rice Product, E-Commerce, Gradient Boosted, Heuristic", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yose Ali Rahman", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Nov 2023"}
