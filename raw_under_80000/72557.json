But, it still has a\nresolution limitation in vertical density variation. \nAlternatively, borehole gravity meter technique can resolve \nthis problem. \n In this research, to get effectiveness in measuring \nborehole gravity response, a forward modeling code \nprogram has been created for some complex synthetic \nmodels. A complex model means that the reservoir has \nsome faults, anticline, syncline, and wedge out shape. And \nthen, a characteristic analysis of gravity anomaly response \nhas been done relates to amplitude, wavelength, boreholes \nspace and model geometry. \n The result of synthetic modeling supported by \namplitude attribute analysis shows that the shape of \ncomplex synthetic model and its depth can be identified \nclearly. This paper shows a simulation of fluid movement \nin reservoir with different models at different times. With \nthis simulation, we can see that 4D borehole microgravity \nis useful to monitoring the fluid movement in reservoir.", "Daftar File": {"C.2.a.3.3.
