{"Nomor": 71349, "Judul": "BONE TURNOVER MARKERS IN CHILDREN: FROM LABORATORY CHALLENGES TO CLINICAL INTERPRETATION", "Abstrak": "Bone turnover markers (BTMs) have been developed many years ago to study, in combination with imaging techniques,\nbone remodeling in adults. In children and adolescents, bone metabolism differs from adults since it implies both growth\nand bone remodeling, suggesting an age- and gender-dependent BTM concentration. Therefore, specific studies have evaluated\nBTMs in not only physiological but also pathological conditions. However, in pediatrics, the use of BTMs in clinical\npractice is still limited due to these many children-related specificities. This review will discuss about physiological levels\nof BTMs as well as their modifications under pathological conditions in children and adolescents. A focus is also given on\nanalytical and clinical challenges that restrain BTM usefulness in pediatrics.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Aur\u00e9lie Ladang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Frank Rauch, Edgard Delvin, Etienne Cavalier"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Osteoblasts \u00b7 Osteoclasts \u00b7 Bone turnover markers \u00b7 PINP \u00b7 CTX \u00b7 BALP \u00b7 TRAP \u00b7 Children", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Feb 2023"}
