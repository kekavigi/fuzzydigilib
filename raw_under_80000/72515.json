{"Nomor": 72515, "Judul": "IDENTIFICATION OF FAULT STRUCTURE AND HYDROCARBON PROSPECT AREAS BASED ON INTEGRATION OF GRAVITY ANOMALIES, GEOLOGY AND PRODUCTION WELL ANALYSIS IN THE X OIL FIELD, EAST KALIMANTAN", "Abstrak": "This paper presents a new approach for identifying\nfault structure and delineating hydrocarbon prospect\nareas based on modeling and correlations of gravity\nanomalies which are supported by geology and\nproduction well data. For a case study, we used the \u2018X\u2019\nOil Field in East Kalimantan-Indonesia which has a\ndepth of sandstone reservoir around 1200 m. Seismic\ndata in this area has low quality due to the surface and\nsubsurface factors. To strengthen the interpretation of\npossibility of the new potential area, we conducted\ngravity survey covering an area of 6.2 km x 7.4 km\nwith approximately 250 m station interval. Each\ngravity station was measured at the level of height of 0\ncm, 55 cm and 90 cm from the surface in order to\ncalculate the vertical gradient anomalies.\nTo identify types of fault and its dip of fault plane,\nwe perform synthetic modeling first based on the ratio\nand difference of the maximum positive and negative\nSVD (Second Vertical Derivative) anomalies. While\nfor the delineation of the prospect area, the correlations\nbetween residual anomaly and vertical gradient\nanomaly supported by geology and production well\ndata were used. Based on the lessons learned from the\nexistence of oil production well and the correlation of\nthe anomalies, it could be identified that hydrocarbon\nprospect area has a low value of vertical gradient\nanomaly and a high value of the residual anomaly.\nThe results show that \u2018X\u2019 oil field has four\npotential areas to be hydrocarbon prospects which\nlocated in the NW and SE of study area with structural\nfaulted anticline as the prospect trap. The thickness of\nsedimentation basin reaches 4 km. The fault structure\nis dominated by normal faults with NE-SW direction\nthat associated with tensional tectonic setting and the\naverage dip of structure is about 70 degrees.", "Daftar File": {"2013 WAWAN GUNAWAN A KADIR 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287843", "2013 WAWAN GUNAWAN A KADIR 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/287844"}, "Penulis": "Wawan Gunawan A.
