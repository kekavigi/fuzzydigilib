Unfortunately, the formulation used has not yet involved a fluid flow \nformulation. The fluid flow formulation, however, is an important aspect that implicates\neffects of gravity, pressure, permeability, fluid viscosity, and fluid saturation. Therefore, \nthis preliminary study is intended to simulate water front of injection using the fluid flow \nformulation in which the gravity effect is quantified by time lapse microgravity method. \nWe apply the 3D numerical approximation of two-phase immiscible and incompressible \nproblems using the IMPES method. The basic method used is a finite-volume scheme to \napproach the pressure equation and a finite-difference scheme to discretize the saturation \nequation. Numerical simulation results show that water front of injection and concentration\nhistory of the displacing fluid which represents fluid saturation can be identified.", "Daftar File": {"NUMERICAL MODELING OF TIME LAPSE MICROGRAVITY.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/288477"}, "Penulis": "Susanti Alawiyah [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Djoko Santoso, Wawan Gunawan A.
