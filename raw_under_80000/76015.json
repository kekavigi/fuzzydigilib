{"Nomor": 76015, "Judul": "SISTEM AKUISISI DATA TERINTEGRASI UNTUK PENGUKURAN GETARAN DAN POSISI KERETA DENGAN MENGGUNAKAN LABVIEW", "Abstrak": "Track condition monitoring systems are inspection systems that diagnose track irregularities and defects on a railway. They consist of data acquisition and post processing analysis. The most popular method is to use track geometry cars. However, track geometry cars usually disturb the schedule and operation of in-service trains. Hence, newer methods for track condition monitoring have been developed, with the goal that data acquisition would be conducted directly from the in-service vehicles, either from the bogie, axle, or car body. Specifically, this research focuses on the design of an integrated acquisition system for data obtained from the car body of an in-service vehicle, using LabVIEW.\nThe integrated data acquisition system is designed to acquire vibrations, position, and speed data. This research only focuses on the acquisition of data from the accelerometers, and then consequently, the integration with the IMU and GPS sensors to make one whole data acquisition system. The finalized data acquisition system developed in this research is then tested for accuracy of acceleration measurement using calibration. After, a field test is conducted to test the consistency of acceleration measurement.\nThe integrated data acquisition system has been successfully developed according to its design requirements and objectives. Hence, the system is able to measure vibration, position, and speed of a moving train from inside the car body. As for acceleration measurement, calibration results were able to show an error of less than 1%, and field test results indicate consistent vibration patterns.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Siti Abyad Khadijah Ghozali [13119217]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Budi Heryadi, S.T., M.T.", "Prof. Dr. Ir.
