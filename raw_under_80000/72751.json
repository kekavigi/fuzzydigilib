{"Nomor": 72751, "Judul": "ADSORBEN PENGOLAHAN AIR DARI BIOMASSA DAN MINERAL", "Abstrak": "Wastewater is produced by human activities, industrial processes, and others. Following the SDG targets, target 6.3 in particular, state that in 2030 the water quality will be improved by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping, and other alternatives to treat wastewater. Thus, current wastewater should be treated in a way that the stated target can be achieved in the future. Dyes in wastewater are produced by textile industries, in which it is released to the environment. If left untreated, health complications such as respiratory diseases as well as the productivity of the water body ecosystem may be a threat due to the dye\u2019s chemical composition and its characteristics. Adsorption is one of the popular methods in treating dye wastewater due to its cheapness and capability in capturing dyes and color pigment. However, certain adsorbents such as chitosan, chitin, and others that are proved effective may not be available in certain regions. Thus, this research will be focusing on utilizing daily materials such as coal fly ash, activated carbon, and wood pellet and test its effectiveness compared to the readily available adsorbents and studying its effective working conditions. Adsorption experiments will be done in semi-continous operations and room temperature. Adsorption is executed by flowing samples to the column and analyzing the effluent. Parameters evaluated include color observations, removal efficiency, surface area and FTIR analysis. Results show activated charcoal as the best adsorbent for color removal, works in pH 5 & 10 with 10 gram adsorbents. Coal fly ash works in pH 10 and 9 gram adsorbents. Wood pellets work in pH 7 with 8 grams adsorbents. All adsorbent works best at dye mass of 0.1 grams/L water. Removal efficiency for activated charcoal, coal fly ash, and wood pellets is 62.98%, 93.7%, 30.5% respectively.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Chardellya Hillary Abigael S.": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/291066"}, "Penulis": "Chardellya Hillary Abigael S.
