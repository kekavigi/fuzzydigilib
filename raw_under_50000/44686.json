{"Nomor": 44686, "Judul": "Width Design of Urban Rail Transit Station Walkway: A Novel Simulation-Based Optimization Approach", "Abstrak": "The optimal design of the walkway at an urban\nrail transit station is a vital issue. The Transit Capacity and\nQuality of Service Manual (TCQSM) TCRP-100 report for\nthe design of urban rail transit station walkway and the\nexisting design models neglect the important factors such as\nrandomness in the passenger arrival rate, randomness and\nstate-dependent service time of the walkway and blocking\nphenomenon when the passenger flow demand exceeds the\nwalkway capacity. There obviously exists a need to develop\na design approach that overcomes these shortcomings. For\nthis purpose, this paper details a simulation-based optimization approach that provides width design through\nautomatic reconfiguration of walkway width during the\nsimulation\u2013optimization process based on phase-type (PH)\ndistribution. The integrated PH/PH(n)/C/C discrete-event\nsimulation (DES) model and optimization method that uses\nthe genetic algorithm (GA) work together concurrently to\nobtain optimized (design) widths for different passenger\nflow and level of service (LOS) The numerical experiments\nare conducted to compare the proposed model with the\nexisting design methods. It reveals that: (1) The width\nobtained by our proposed model is higher than the existing\nwidth design models; (2) when squared coefficient of variation of passenger arrival interval increases, the walkway\nwidth increases more for our proposed model than the\nexisting design models; (3) when the arrival rate increases,\nthe walkway width of our proposed model increases faster\nthan the existing design models; (4) the increase in the length\nof walkway has no significant effect on the walkway width.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Afaq Khattak [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["\u2022 Jiang Yangsheng  \u2022 Hu Lu  \u2022 Zhu Juanxiu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering of railroads & roads", "Kata Kunci": "Urban rail transit station  Walkway simulation-based optimization  Queueing system  PH distribution  Genetic Algorithm", "Sumber": "Urban Rail Transit (2017) 3(2):112\u2013127", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Okt 2019"}
