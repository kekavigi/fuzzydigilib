This method was implemented in a finite volume numerical scheme e called\n5ESCARGOTS code. Comparison with experimental data showed that it can be used to predict the flow\npattern and statistical characteristics (slug velocity, length, and frequency). However, the capabilities of\nthis approach have been tested only for water-air flows in a straight horizontal pipe.\nIn this work, we validate the application of the code to some unconventional problems. Firstly, we test\nthe possibility of slug capturing approach to describe and predict the relevant features of air/high viscosity oils or air/non-Newtonian fluids flows. Comparisons between some slug characteristics and\nempirical correlations, available in literature, are discussed. Then, we move from simple geometries\ntoward more complex conditions that may be representative of actual application cases, also employing\nhigh viscous oils as liquid phase. Comparison against experimental data shows results in reasonable\nagreement.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MARCO FERRARI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Arianna Bonzanini", "Pietro Poesio"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "5ESCARGOTS code, one-dimensional, hyperbolic, transient five-equation two-fluid model, non-Newtonian fluids5ESCARGOTS code, one-dimensional, hyperbolic, transient five-equation two-fluid model, non-Newtonian fluids", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 5, Issue 2, Pages 171-177 (June  2019), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.01.005", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Nov 2019"}
