Quantifying\nregional or global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and searching for appropriate mitigation measures\nhave become a relatively hot issue in international global climate change studies. The high\ntemporal and spatial variability of GHG emissions from soils makes their field measurement at regional\nor national scales impractical. To develop emission factors for a wide range of management practices\nsuch as those given in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Tier I methodology are often considered\nas a convenient technique to estimate emissions, but these can result in substantial errors when\napplied to specific geographical regions. Accordingly, considering the complexity of greenhouse gas production\nin soils, process-based models are required to quantify and predict the GHG emissions, and also\ninterpret the intricate relationships among the gas emissions, the environmental factors and the ecological\ndrivers....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Li Hu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Qiu Jianjun, Wang Ligang, Yang Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Climate change, Greenhouse gas, Carbon and nitrogen cycles, DNDC model", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect, Acta Ecologica Sinica 31 (2011) 91\u201396", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Agu 2019"}
