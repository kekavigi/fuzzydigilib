{"Nomor": 48703, "Judul": "POTENSI BAKTERI LACTOBACILLUS PLANTARUM SEBAGAI PROBIOTIK UNTUK KOSMETIK PERAWATAN WAJAH", "Abstrak": "Skin microbiome has become an interesting topic because of the importance of it towards our skins. The\ndistruption of skin microbiome could lead to various skin\u2019s problems such as exim because of the\ndomination of Staphyloacoccus aureus and acnes because of Propionibacterium acnes. Probiotics could be\nthe new solution to maintain our skin microbiome while also benefits our skin health and beauty because\nof it\u2019s abilites to produce metabolites which are beneficial for us. Lactobacillus plantarum could produce\norganic acids which could rehydrate and exfoliate our skin cell, bacteriocin that could inhibit growth of\npathogenic bacteria and has antioxidant activites that could protect our skin from radical matters. In this\nresearch, we would like to understand the potential of L. plantarum who cultured in milk to produce\nmetabolites that could inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria thus it could be used for cosmetic\u2019s active\ncompounds. The evaluation of the inhibition activites in the preliminary studies was conducted from\nextracellular metabolites, intracellular metabolites, and the cell of L. plantarum by Kirby-bauer methods\nusing S. aureus and E. coli as the test subject. After that, optimation was conducted with pasteurized milk\npH 6.5 for 48 hours, 37 \u00b0C. The variation of inocula that was used were 5%(I5), 10%(I10), 15%(I15). The\ntotal organic acids were observed every 4 hours and the inhibition activites was observed every 8 hours\nusing s. aureus and P. aeruginosa as test subject. The result of preliminary test shows the inhibition\nactivities of extracellular metabolite presence at 12 hours and reach it peak at 48 hours with diameter of the\nzone of inhibition for S. aureus is 8.43\u00b10, 24mm and E. coli is 9.89\u00b10.55mm. The intracellular metabolite\nhas the inhibition activites at S aureus at 48 hours with diameter of the zone of inhibition of 2.78\u00b13.93mm\nand for the cell of the L. plantarum did not show any sign of inhibition activites. Optimation of cell\nconcentration in pasteurized milk with variation of I5, I10, and I15 produce growth rate of cell at 0, 188/hr, 0,\n202/hr, and 0, 24/hr, Total organic acids at 16.041ppm/hr, 20.883ppm/hr, 24, 167ppm/hr, and the decrease\nof pH at 0.051/hr, 0.057/hr, 0.055/hr respectively. The result of inhibition activites of S. aureus presence\nat 24hr for the I5 and I10 but for I15 variation it also presence at 16hr with the zone of inhibition of 7\u00b10.0mm,\n7.83\u00b10, 25mm, and 6.04\u00b10.6mm respectively. For the inhibition activites of P. aeruginosa, it presence at\n48hr for I5 variation, 40hr for I10, and 16 hr for I15 with the zone of inhibition of 6.94\u00b10.76mm, 5.3\u00b10.31mm,\nand 6.99\u00b10.014mm respectively. The conclusion of this research shows that L. plantarum which cultured\nwith pasteurized milk has the potential to be used as a cometic active compounds with the optimum inocula\nof 15% because it shows the inhibition effect of S.aureus at 16hr (6.99\u00b10.014mm) and P,aeruginosa at 16hr\n(6.04\u00b10.6mm)", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Bernardinus Adrianto": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/208538"}, "Penulis": "Bernardinus Adrianto [10416039]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Pingkan Aditiawati, MS", "Dr.Eng.
