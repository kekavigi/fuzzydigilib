{"Nomor": 48389, "Judul": "HERPETOFAUNAL DIVERSITY OF BAWEAN ISLAND, GRESIK, EAST JAVA", "Abstrak": "Bawean Island is one of the key wildlife conservation sites of Indonesia, yet information about its diversity of herpetofauna is mostly unknown. The aim of the study is to assess herpetofauna diversity and biogeographic relationships of Bawean Island with nearby islands as well as finding novel herpetofauna species. The study was conducted on Bawean Island between December 2019 and January 2020. Sampling was conducted using transects comprised of 10x30 m plots along streams or trails throughout 10 designated locations and supplemented with 7 other sites. All transects were categorised into 10 groups based on ecosystem types and disturbance levels. Some specimens collected will be preserved for further analysis. Additionally, interviews with locals were conducted to broaden the data. Analysis used in the study includes biodiversity assessment based on alpha, beta, and gamma diversity and comparative morphometric-meristic analysis to identify specimens. A total of 8 amphibian and 30 reptile species were recorded. The species discovery curve is yet to reach stationary state, thus showing possibilities of more species to be discovered on the island. Some specialised herpetofauna found were only seen at certain habitat with suitable niches. In contrast, highly adaptable, tolerant species like and other human-associated species were observed to inhabit various habitats throughout the island. The species richness and diversity of herpetofauna is the highest in moderately disturbed riparian ecosystem. Highest evenness peaked in moderately disturbed hilly rainforest ecosystem. Lowest diversity and evenness were found in severely disturbed aquaculture ecosystem. The diversity and biogeographic highlight of the research was the discovery of Klakah bent-toed geckos (Cyrtodactylus klakahensis) and Kapuas reed snake (Calamaria melanota), each known as endemic species from Java and Borneo, the latter have been described from Karimunjawa recently as well, but distinct biogeographic connections of Bawean is currently unable to be determined based on these findings only. As for now, no new amphibian nor reptile species found on Bawean Island.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Rizal Ananda Sugianto": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/208130"}, "Penulis": "Rizal Ananda Sugianto [10615040]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Djoko Tjahjono Iskandar", "Aditya Dimas Pramudya, S.Si., M.Si."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Biologi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Ilmu dan Teknologi Hayati", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Herpetofauna, amphibian, reptile, diversity, biogeography, Bawean", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Jun 2020"}
