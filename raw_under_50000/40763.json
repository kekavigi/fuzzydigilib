{"Nomor": 40763, "Judul": "Observation of motorcycle helmet use rates in Michigan after partialrepeal of the universal motorcycle helmet law", "Abstrak": "Motorcycle crashes result in a significant health burden, including many fatal injuries and serious non-fatal head injuries. Helmets are highly effective in preventing such trauma, and jurisdictions that requirehelmet use of all motorcyclists have higher rates of helmet use and lower rates of head injuries amongmotorcyclists. The current study examines helmet use and characteristics of helmeted operators andtheir riding conditions in Michigan, following a weakening of the state\u2019s universal motorcycle helmetuse law in April 2012. Data on police-reported crashes occurring during 2012\u201314 and from a stratifiedroadside observational survey undertaken in Southeast Michigan during May-September 2014 were usedto estimate statewide helmet use rates. Observed helmet use was more common among operators ofsports motorcycles, on freeways, and in the morning, and least common among operators of cruisers,on minor arterials, and in the afternoon. The rate of helmet use across the state was estimated at 75%,adjusted for roadway type, motorcycle class, and time of day. Similarly, the helmet use rate found fromexamination of crash records was 73%. In the observation survey, 47% of operators wore jackets, 94% worelong pants, 54% wore boots, and 80% wore gloves. Protective clothing of jackets and gloves was most oftenworn by sport motorcycle operators and long pants and boots most often by riders of touring motorcycles.Findings highlight the much lower rate of helmet use in Michigan compared with states that have auniversal helmet use law, although the rate is higher than observed in many states with partial helmetlaws. Targeted interventions aimed at specific groups of motorcyclists and situations where helmet userates are particularly low should be considered to increase helmet use.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lisa Buckley [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Raymond Binghama, Carol A.
