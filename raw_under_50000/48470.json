{"Nomor": 48470, "Judul": "DESIGNING MATRIX ACIDIZING IN TIGHT LIMESTONE FORMATION WITH SENSITIVITY OF ACID TYPE AND VOLUME ACID INJECTED", "Abstrak": "One of the challenges in producing oil from tight reservoir is the small value of permeability. Stimulation treatment is known can improve the permeability. One of the most known stimulation treatments is matrix acidizing. Matrix acidizing in limestone formation can increase production by creating wormhole from a dissolution process. This method has been proven by many years of successful application around the world. This study was conducted to find the scenario of acid type and volume acid injected to get the best result of fold of increase and net present value.\nMatrix acidizing in this study is conducted in the tight limestone of Baturaja formation with depth range from 1629.5 to 1645 mMD. The permeability is 2.3 md and the porosity is 23%. The acid will be injected with different acid type and the volume range from 30 to 100 gal/ft. Five type of acid will be used to see the different result of wormhole radius and skin that created during acidizing. The first was using 5% acetic acid (CH3COOH), the second was using 9% formic acid (HCOOH), the third was using 10% acetic acid (CH3COOH), the fourth was using 15% HCl, and the last was using 28% HCl.\nThis study presents the parameters of limestone matrix acidizing. To determine the feasibility of the formation to conduct matrix acidizing, the in-situ stress parameter such as poisson\u2019s ratio, young modulus, and fracture pressure will be calculated by using microsoft excel. The matrix acidizing design parameter from sensitivity of acid type and volume acid injected was calculated by Daccord\u2019s model. The wellbore pressure should be maintained below the fracture pressure. The cut off pumping pressure to placing the acid into the formation is set as 5000 psi due to limitation of surface facilities. With the production forecast, it can be determined the result of fold of increase and net present value from all scenario. The analysis in this study can be used to determine the acid type and volume of acid injected in designing limestone acidizing to get the best result of fold of increase and net present value.\nThe novelty of this study is the analysis of acid type and volume acid injected effect in limestone acidizing design to get the best result of fold of increase and net present value.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Siska Marsinta Siahaan [12216048]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ardhi Hakim Lumban Gaol, S.T., M.T., M.Si., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "limestone acidizing, acidizing design, in-situ stress, acid type, and volume acid injected", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Jun 2020"}
