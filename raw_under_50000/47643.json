{"Nomor": 47643, "Judul": "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND VALIDATION OF HYBRID MATERIAL FIBER METAL LAMINATE (FML) FOR BATTERY SYSTEM PROTECTION", "Abstrak": "As electric vehicles (EVs) continue to proliferate, the study of the battery system becomes paramount. The lithium-ion battery is susceptible to a short circuit, which can lead to fire and even explosion if it experiences large deformation. Ground impacts by stones and road debris have caused several accidents on EVs. Therefore, it is critical to protect the battery system in EVs using lightweight material. The purpose of this research is to design an experiment for validation of the energy absorption capability of fiber metal laminate (FML) as battery system protection. The FML was manufactured using the hand lay-up method and tested using a gas gun to obtain the force-displacement curve due to the high-velocity impact loading. Numerical simulation of the impact test was performed by using the nonlinear finite element method. Three models validated using the experimental results were the one-layer aluminum plate model, the three-layer aluminum plate model, and the FML model. The force-displacement curves obtained from the numerical simulation achieve good agreement with the experimental results by tuning several simulation parameters. Thus, the design optimization process to comply with the safety limit can be carried out with great confidence. The optimized design consists of a 4.8-mm-thick carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) plate sandwiched between two 2-mm-thick AA7075-T6 plates. The design can reduce the battery shortening by 59% with an additional mass of only 80 grams compared to the baseline case, which adopts a 6.35-mm-thick aluminum plate as the shield plate. Design obtained from this study is conservative as it does not consider the strain rate effect.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Teresa Nirmala": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/207135"}, "Penulis": "Teresa Nirmala [23619002]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
