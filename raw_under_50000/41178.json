Mindlin\u2019s two-dimensional\nplate equation is used, from which a system of first-order nonlinear differential equations govern-\ning the evolution of the vibration amplitude is obtained. Numerical solutions by the Runge-Kutta\nmethod show that in common operating conditions of quartz resonators the nonlinear effect varies\nfrom noticeable to significant. As resonators are to be made smaller and thinner in the future\nwith about the same power requirement, nonlinear effects will become more important and need\nmore understanding and consideration in resonator design.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Nian Li [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zhenghua Qian, Jiashi Yang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "quarts resonator, thickness-shear mode, transient processes, nonlinear effect,Mindlin\u2019s plate equation", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 4, August, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Jul 2019"}
