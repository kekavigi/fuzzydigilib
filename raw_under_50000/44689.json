{"Nomor": 44689, "Judul": "Traffic Management Plan Evaluation Outside the Station in Emergent Events of Urban Rail Transit", "Abstrak": "Emergent events of urban rail transit may cause\ntrain delay, even service disruption, and then lead to a large\nnumber of passengers stranded. Urban rail transit system is\ndifficult to maintain normal operation, so passengers shall\nbe transported through other traffic modes outside the\nstation. Traffic management plan outside the station is\nanalyzed and evaluated in advance, which can increase\nevacuation efficiency and reduce the influence of events on\nsociety. The plan is evaluated through analyzing and simulation. Firstly, this paper analyzes the influence of events\non traffic outside the station and introduces common means\nof traffic management. Then, this paper studies integrated\nsimulation method and chooses key evaluation indicators,\nthus use the order of preference by similarity to ideal\nsolution to evaluate the traffic management plan based on\nsimulation. Finally, taking Jiangsu Road station as an\nexample, this paper evaluates the effectiveness of different\nplans by simulation, the evaluation results show that plan 2\n(partial priority) is optimal, which provides a reference for\nurban rail transit emergency management.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jing Teng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Chuanyong He   \u2022 Xianglong Liu   \u2022 Xinzheng Yang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering of railroads & roads", "Kata Kunci": "Emergent events  Urban rail transit  Traffic management outside the station  Simulation evaluation", "Sumber": "Urban Rail Transit (2016) 2(1):16\u201327", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Okt 2019"}
