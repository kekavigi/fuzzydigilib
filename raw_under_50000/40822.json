{"Nomor": 40822, "Judul": "Radiative Thermal Memristor", "Abstrak": "Based on the thermal hysteresis of a phase change material exchanging radiative heat with a phase\ninvariable one, we propose a radiative thermal memristor characterized by a Lissajous curve between their\nexchanged heat flux and temperature difference periodically modulated in time. For a memristor with\nterminals of VO2 and a blackbody, it is shown that (i) the temperature variations of its memristance follow a\nclosed loop determined by the thermal hysteresis width of VO2, and (ii) the thermal memristance on-off\nratio is determined by the contrast of VO2 emissivities for its insulating and metallic phases and is equal to\n3.6. The analogy of the proposed memristor to its electrical counterpart makes it promising to lay the\nfoundations of the thermal computing with photons.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jose Ordonez-Miranda, [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Youn\u00b4es Ezzahri,", "Jose A.
