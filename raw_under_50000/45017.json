{"Nomor": 45017, "Judul": "Pipeline Wax Deposition Modeling: A Sensitivity Study On Two Commercial Software", "Abstrak": "This paper presents the results of a sensitivity study carried out to investigate the performances of two\ncommercial codes, OLGA and LedaFlow, used to model the wax deposition process in pipelines under\nmultiphase flow. Reliable simulations of the phenomenon are essential to properly design pipelines and\nto adopt cost-effective strategies for prevention and removal of wax deposits, reducing the risks of\nblockage. The main limit of the available models is that their predictions depend on a number of parameters which are usually adjusted to fit the experimental data obtained from laboratory deposition\ntests. Since a reliable upscale criterion has not been developed yet, model predictions have been more\nsuitably validated using real field data, reported in literature. The performances of the commercial codes\nin modelling wax precipitation and deposition have been compared to each other", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "GIANCARLO GIACCHETTA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Barbara Marchetti", "Mariella Leporini", "Alessandro Terenzi", "Davide Dall\u2019Acqua", "Laura Capece", "Roberta Cocci Grifoni"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Industrial oils, fats, waxes, gases", "Kata Kunci": "OLGA, LedaFlow, commercial software, simulation, pipeline", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 5, Issue 2, Pages 206-213 (June  2019), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2017.12.007", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Nov 2019"}
