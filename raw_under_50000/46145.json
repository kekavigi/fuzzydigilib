{"Nomor": 46145, "Judul": "PEPTIDE GLYCODENDRIMERS AS POTENTIAL VACCINES FOR OLIVE POLLEN ALLERGY", "Abstrak": "Olive pollen is one of the most important causes of respiratory\nallergy, with Ole e 1 being the most clinically relevant sensitizing allergen.\nPeptide-based vaccines represent promising therapeutic approaches, but the use\nof adjuvants is required to strengthen the weak immunogenicity of small\npeptides. We propose the use of dendrimeric scaffolds conjugated to the T cell\nimmunodominant epitope of Ole e 1 (OE109?130) for the development of novel\nvaccines against olive pollen allergy. Four dendrimeric scaffolds containing an\nester/ether with nine mannoses, an ester succinimidyl linker with nine N-acetylglucosamine\nunits or nine ethylene glycol units conjugated to OE109?130 peptide\nwere designed, and their cytotoxicity, internalization pattern, and immunomodulatory\nproperties were analyzed in vitro. None of the dendrimers exhibited\ncytotoxicity in humanized rat basophil (RBL-2H3), human bronchial epithelial\nCalu-3, and human mast LAD2 cell lines. Confocal images indicated that\nmannosylated glycodendropeptides exhibited lower colocalization with a\nlysosomal marker. Moreover, mannosylated glycodendropeptides showed higher transport tendency through the epithelial barrier formed by Calu-3 cells cultured at the air?liquid interface. Finally, mannosylated glycodendropeptides promoted Treg and IL10+Treg proliferation and IL-10 secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from allergic patients. Mannosylated dendrimers conjugated with OE109?130 peptide from Ole e 1 have been identified as suitable candidates for the development of novel vaccines of olive pollen allergy.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Sara Benede?
