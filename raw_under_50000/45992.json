{"Nomor": 45992, "Judul": "Nanocellulose as a natural source for groundbreaking applications in materials science: Today\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds state", "Abstrak": "Nanocelluloses are natural materials with at least one dimension in the nano-scale. They combine\nimportant cellulose properties with the features of nanomaterials and open new horizons for materials\nscience and its applications. The field of nanocellulose materials is subdivided into three domains:\nbiotechnologically produced bacterial nanocellulose hydrogels, mechanically delaminated cellulose\nnanofibers, and hydrolytically extracted cellulose nanocrystals. This review article describes today\u2019s\nstate regarding the production, structural details, physicochemical properties, and innovative\napplications of these nanocelluloses. Promising technical applications including gels/foams, thickeners/ stabilizers as well as reinforcing agents have been proposed and research from last five years indicates new potential for groundbreaking innovations in the areas of cosmetic products, wound\ndressings, drug carriers, medical implants, tissue engineering, food and composites. The current state of worldwide commercialization and the challenge of reducing nanocellulose production costs are also\ndiscussed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Dieter Klemm [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Emily D.
