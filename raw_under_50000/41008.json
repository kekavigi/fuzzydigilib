{"Nomor": 41008, "Judul": "Verification of the applicability of PRECIS-simulated temperature on the Loess Plateau of China", "Abstrak": "Temperature is a critical variable in plant growth and water cycle. Under the background of global warming,\nprojection of potential changes in temperature can provide important information for related issues. Although\nRegional ClimateModels (RCMs) are popular for climate projection due to higher resolution compared with General Circulation Models (GCMs), their simulation accuracy should still be assessed in details. By using ERA40 reanalysis data as the boundary conditions to run PRECIS, this study assessed the ability of PRECIS to simulate temperature on the Loess Plateau of China....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zhemin Lu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zhi Li, Jingjing Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Regional climate model, PRECIS, Applicability, Loess Plateau of China, Temperature", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Jul 2019"}
