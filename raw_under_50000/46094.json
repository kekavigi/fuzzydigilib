{"Nomor": 46094, "Judul": "EXTRACELLULAR-MATRIX-ANCHORED CLICK MOTIFS FOR SPECIFIC TISSUE TARGETING", "Abstrak": "Local presentation of cancer drugs by injectable drug-eluting depots reduces systemic side effects and improves\nefficacy. However, local depots deplete their drug stores and are difficult to introduce into stiff tissues, or organs, such as the\nbrain, that cannot accommodate increased pressure. We present a method for introducing targetable depots through injection of\nactivated ester molecules into target tissues that react with and anchor themselves to the local extracellular matrix (ECM) and\nsubsequently capture systemically administered small molecules through bioorthogonal click chemistry. A computational model\nof tissue-anchoring depot formation and distribution was verified by histological analysis and confocal imaging of cleared tissues.\nECM-anchored click groups do not elicit any noticeable local or systemic toxicity or immune response and specifically capture\nsystemically circulating molecules at intradermal, intratumoral, and intracranial sites for multiple months. Taken together, ECM\nanchoring of click chemistry motifs is a promising approach to specific targeting of both small and large therapeutics, enabling\nrepeated local presentation for cancer therapy and other diseases.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mary R.
