{"Nomor": 46161, "Judul": "ACTIVITY-BASED SENSING: ACHIEVING CHEMICAL SELECTIVITY THROUGH CHEMICAL REACTIVITY", "Abstrak": "Sensors provide powerful tools and technologies to peer\ninto the natural world, enabling researchers to discover\nand decipher new molecular phenomena through the design,\nconstruction, and application of chemical probes. Indeed, the\ninvention of new sensors drives the ability to literally create\nnew types of experiments across a variety of different length\nand time scales, bringing together chemists from core areas of\norganic, inorganic, physical, biological, and analytical chemistry\ntogether with biologists, physicists, and engineers in synergistic\nways. At its core, fundamental and applied research in chemical\nsensors requires molecular-level selectivity in complex environments,\nand in this context, the search for selectivity has\nprimarily focused on binding-based approaches derived from\nmolecular recognition, akin to the lock-and-key constructs that\nendow enzymes and other biological systems with exquisite\nspecificity. Along these lines, the origins of supramolecular\nhost?guest chemistry have launched an entire field of\nmolecular sensors and molecular logic gates, and traditional\nsensors use principles from this biomimetic and bioinspired\nchemistry.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Christopher J.
