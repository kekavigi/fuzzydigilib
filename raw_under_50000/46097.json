{"Nomor": 46097, "Judul": "CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC AND ENERGETIC INSIGHTS INTO REDUCED DISSOLUTION AND PHYSICAL STABILITY OF A DRUG?SURFACTANT SALT: THE CASE OF NORFLOXACIN LAURYL SULFATE", "Abstrak": "A commonly used pharmaceutical surfactant, sodium lauryl sulfate\n(SLS), has been reported to reduce the dissolution rate of drugs due to the\nformation of a less soluble drug?lauryl sulfate salt. In this study, we provide direct\ncrystallographic evidence of the formation of salt between SLS and norfloxacin\n(NOR), [NORH+][LS?]\u00b71.5 H2O. The available crystal structure also enables the\nuse of the energy framework to gain an understanding of the structure?property\nrelationship. Results show that the hydrophobic methyl groups in SLS dominate the\nsurfaces of the [NORH+][LS?]\u00b71.5 H2O crystals, resulting in the increased\nhydrophobicity and reduced wettability by aqueous media. Moreover, an analysis of\nmolecular environments and energy calculations of water molecules provides insight\ninto the stability of [NORH+][LS?]\u00b71.5 H2O with variations in the relative humidity\nand temperature. In summary, important pharmaceutical properties, such as\nsolubility, dissolution, and thermal stability, of the drug?surfactant salt [NORH+]-\n[LS?]\u00b71.5 H2O have been characterized and understood based on crystallographic\nand energetic analyses of the crystal structure.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yiwang Guo [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Manish Kumar Mishra, Chenguang Wang, and Changquan Calvin Sun"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "norfloxacin, sodium lauryl sulfate, hydrate, dissolution, physical stability, crystallography, crystal energy framework", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Feb 2020"}
