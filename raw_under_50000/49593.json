{"Nomor": 49593, "Judul": "HOW AGILE METHODS ARE USED AND THE IMPACT IT HAS ON VIDEO GAME DEVELOPMENT (AN EXPLORATORY STUDY OF AGATE STUDIO)", "Abstrak": "Agile methods and practices are widely used in software engineering and video game\ndevelopment is a rather new but promising creative economy sector that is developing in Indonesia.\nWhile it has many similarities to software engineering, video game development has its own set of\nchallenges unique to it. However, the systematic use and impact of Agile in game development is largely\nundocumented, unlike in software engineering. This research aims to provide an understanding of this\nissue specifically in Agate Studio, one of the largest and most successful video game studios based in\nIndonesia. The findings of this research show that Agate Studio mainly uses Scrum combined with\nSemi-Waterfall, Kanban, and Scrumban, matching the needs of the project it is used for, whereas XP\npractices are used implicitly and is also adjust to the type of project under way. The main positive\nimpacts of Agile is on communication, facilitating the finding and change of features, improves quality\nof the game, on managing the scope of the project, as well as indirectly towards productivity of the\ndevelopment team.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Farah Almira Kusumawardani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/213157", "2020 TS PP FARAH ALMIRA K 1 - FULL TEXT.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246810"}, "Penulis": "Farah Almira Kusumawardani [19017215]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
