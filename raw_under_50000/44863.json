{"Nomor": 44863, "Judul": "Quantized conductance through a dissipative atomic point contact", "Abstrak": "Signatures of quantum transport are expected to quickly vanish as dissipation is introduced in a system. This dissipation can take several forms, including that of particle loss, which has the consequence that the total probability current is not conserved. Here, we study the effect of such losses at a quantum point contact (QPC) for ultracold atoms. Experimentally, dissipation is provided by a near-resonant optical tweezer the power and detuning of which control the loss rates for the different internal atomic states as well as their effective Zeeman shifts. We theoretically model this situation by including losses in the Landauer-B\u00fcttiker formalism over a wide range of dissipative rates. We find good agreement between our measurements and our model, both featuring robust conductance plateaus. Finally, we are able to map out the atomic density by varying the position of the near-resonant tweezer inside the QPC, realizing a dissipative scanning gate microscope for cold atoms.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Laura Corman [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Philipp Fabritius ,", "Samuel H\u00e4usler,", "Jeffrey Mohan ,", "Lena H.
