We study here how to learn the ?N2 pairwise interactions in a RNN with N\nneurons to embed L manifolds of dimensionD ? N.We show that the capacity, i.e., the maximal ratio L=N,\ndecreases as j log ?j?D, where ? is the error on the position encoded by the neural activity along each manifold.\nHence, RNN are flexible memory devices capable of storing a large number of manifolds at high spatial\nresolution. Our results rely on a combination of analytical tools fromstatistical mechanics and random matrix\ntheory, extending Gardner\u2019s classical theory of learning to the case of patterns with strong spatial correlations.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Aldo Battista [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["R\u00b4emi Monasson"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Physics", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 124, 048302 (2020), APS", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "03 Feb 2020"}
