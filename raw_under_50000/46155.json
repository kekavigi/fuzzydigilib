{"Nomor": 46155, "Judul": "DNAZYMES AS ACTIVITY-BASED SENSORS FOR METAL IONS: RECENT APPLICATIONS, DEMONSTRATED ADVANTAGES, CURRENT CHALLENGES, AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS", "Abstrak": "Metal ions can be beneficial or toxic depending on their identity,\noxidation state, and concentration. Therefore, the ability to detect and quantify different\ntypes of metal ions using portable sensors or in situ imaging agents is important for better\nenvironmental monitoring, in vitro medical diagnostics, and imaging of biological systems.\nWhile numerous metal ions in different oxidation states are present in the environment\nand biological systems, only a limited number of them can be detected effectively using\ncurrent methods. In this Account, we summarize research results from our group that\novercome this limitation by the development of a novel class of activity-based sensors\nbased on metal-dependent DNAzymes, which are DNA molecules with enzymatic activity......", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ryan J.
