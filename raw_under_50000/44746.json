{"Nomor": 44746, "Judul": "Arrow of Causality and Quantum Gravity", "Abstrak": "Causality in quantum field theory is defined by the vanishing of field commutators for spacelike\nseparations. However, this does not imply a direction for causal effects. Hidden in our conventions for\nquantization is a connection to the definition of an arrow of causality, i.e., what is the past and what is the\nfuture. If we mix quantization conventions within the same theory, we get a violation of microcausality.\nIn such a theory with mixed conventions, the dominant definition of the arrow of causality is determined\nby the stable states. In some quantum gravity theories, such as quadratic gravity and possibly asymptotic\nsafety, such a mixed causality condition occurs. We discuss some of the implications.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "JOHN F.
