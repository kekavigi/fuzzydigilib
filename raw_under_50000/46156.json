{"Nomor": 46156, "Judul": "ELECTROSYNTHESIS USING CARBOXYLIC ACID DERIVATIVES: NEW TRICKS FOR OLD REACTIONS", "Abstrak": "Electrosynthetic organic chemistry is an old discipline that\ntakes its root in Faraday\u2019s seminal works. The field has a rich history and is in\nthe midst of a renaissance, due to the growing impetus of the chemical community\nto develop greener, more economical, and more efficient synthetic\nmethodologies. Indeed, electrosynthesis relies on one of the greenest and\ncheapest reagents in the world: the electron itself......", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Matthew C.
