{"Nomor": 41019, "Judul": "GUIDEDWAVES INMULTILAYERED PLATES: AN IMPROVED ORTHOGONAL POLYNOMIAL APPROACH", "Abstrak": "Conventional orthogonal polynomial approach can solve the multilayered plate only\nwhen the material properties of two adjacent layers do not change significantly. This paper de-\nveloped an improved orthogonal polynomial approach to solve wave propagation in multilayered\nplates with very dissimilar material properties. Through numerical comparisons among the exact\nsolution, the results from the conventional polynomial approach and from the improved poly-\nnomial approach, the validity of the improved polynomial approach is illustrated. Finally, it is\nshown that the conventional polynomial approach can not yield correct continuous normal stress\nprofiles. The improved orthogonal polynomial approach has overcome this drawback.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jiangong Yu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["J. E. Lefebvre, L.
