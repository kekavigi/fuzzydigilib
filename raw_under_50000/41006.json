{"Nomor": 41006, "Judul": "Spatio-temporal distribution pattern of vegetation coverage in Junggar Basin, Xinjiang", "Abstrak": "Vegetation coverage is an indicator used for exploring the growth of vegetation, which has attracted attention\nfrom ecologists owing to its significant role in ecological conservation and restoration. As an important component of the terrestrial ecosystem, changes in vegetation coverage reflect changes in the environment, especially with respect to arid areas. A change of vegetation coverage will trigger desertification, degradation of the ecoenvironment, and regional climate change. Hence, we studied the spatio-temporal distribution pattern of vegetation coverage and ephemerals in the Junggar Basin during the last fewdecades based on normalized difference vegetation index....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Cheng Duan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["LingWu, Lingyun He, Shaoming Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Vegetation, coverage Spatio-temporal distribution, Cropland expansion", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Jul 2019"}
