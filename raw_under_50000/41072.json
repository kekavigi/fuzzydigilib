{"Nomor": 41072, "Judul": "Estimation of saturated hydraulic conductivity of coarse-grained soils using particle shape and electrical resistivity", "Abstrak": "Based on the similarity in the underlying mechanisms between electrical and hydraulic conduction in porous\nmedia, Archie's equation can be combinedwith the Kozeny-Carman (KC) equation to estimate the hydraulic conductivity\n(K) of coarse-grained soils. However, the assumption of the exponent m in Archie's equation, which is\nequivalent to the assumed porosity at specific soil electrical properties, reduces the accuracy of the value of K predicted\nusing the combination of Archie's equation and the KC equation. Therefore, this study introduces a depolarization\nfactor, which allows the exponent m in Archie's equation to be estimated from the shape of the\nparticles. Consequently, this study proposes a formula for estimating K for coarse-grained soils based on the combination\nof Archie's equation, the KC equation, and the depolarization factor. Data from laboratory experiments\nperformed in this work and available data from the literature were used to validate the proposed model. In addition,\nthe optimal value for the exponent m was recommended for predicting hydraulic conductivity using\nthe proposed K estimating formula in the absence of particle shape data. Data obtained in the experiments and\nliterature revealed that the proposed model is comparatively reliable in predicting K.", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP JONGMUK WON 1": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/178022"}, "Penulis": "Jongmuk Won [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Junghee Park, Hyunwook Chooc, Susan Burns"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Porosity Hydraulic conductivity Electrical resistivity Particle shape Kozeny-Carman equation Archie's equation", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 167 (2019) 19\u201325, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2019.05.013", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Jul 2019"}
