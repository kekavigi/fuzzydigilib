{"Nomor": 41231, "Judul": "EXPERIMENTAL STUDY FOR INCREASING EFFICIENCY OF SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC MODULE BY MEANS OF COOLING", "Abstrak": "Experimental studies have been performed on a small scale PV system including\ntwo modules with the same sizes and the same characteristics. Each panel has the\nsize of 0.396 m length, 0.289 m width, 0.023 m thick, and maximum power of 10\nW. Coconut oil is used as phase change material in this study for cooling purpose.\nThe coconut oil application is performed in two ways: a. directly used in hollow\naluminum bars, b. encapsulated in spherical shape with very small diameter which\nis called as microencapsulated PCM (MEPCM), and placed inside hollow\naluminum bars attached to the back side of the solar panel. Outer dimension of the\naluminum bar is 0.26 x 0.011 x 0.011 m. MPPT device is also used to maximize\nthe PV power. The system is tested under direct sunlight at PPEBT lab. The result\nof the experiment for solar PV cooled by MEPCM shows an increase of 2.65%\nefficiency above the normal PV, while using MPPT an increase of 14.63% solar\nPV efficiency than normal PV is obtained. Cooling effect using coconut oil\nresulted in this research shows an increase of 2.43% of efficiency than the solar\nPV efficiency cooled by MEPCM. Because of some additional resistances inside\nthe aluminum bar, the effect of MEPCM is limited significantly. Especially, the\namount of coconut oil used was still small. However, this study is still showing\nthat the ability of MEPCM and coconut oil in thermal storage purposes.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Duong Viet Anh": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/178257", "BAB 1 Duong Viet Anh": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/178258", "BAB 2 Duong Viet Anh": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/178259", "BAB 3 Duong Viet Anh": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/178260", "BAB 4 Duong Viet Anh": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/178261", "BAB 5 Duong Viet Anh": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/178262", "BAB 6 Duong Viet Anh": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/178263", "PUSTAKA Duong Viet Anh": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/178264"}, "Penulis": "Duong Viet Anh [23110303]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Abdurrachim", "Dr. Ir.
