{"Nomor": 41172, "Judul": "STABILITYANALYSIS OF TWO-DIMENSIONAL LANDSLIDES SUBJECTED TOSEISMIC LOADS", "Abstrak": "In the past, the pseudo-static method used to be the most common for evaluating\nthe stability of landslides under seismic loads, in which static forces acting on the center of gravity\nof a sliding body are used to consider the effects of earthquake. However, seismic loads of rock\nand soil differ from time and location to time and location. Obviously, it is irrational for the\npseudo-static approach to be applied to solving dynamic problems. In this paper, a displacement-\npseudo-dynamic model is proposed to assess seismic stability of landslides, in which the sinusoidal-\ncosinusoidal wave is applied to simulating earthquake displacement, and an \u201camplification factor\u201d\nof peak seismic displacement is referred to as the amplification of seismic wave when it propagates\nfromthe bottomto the top of the landslide. The effects of physico-mechanical behaviors of a sliding\nbody on seismic stability of soil slopes are taken into account as well as inertia forces and damping\nforces. The sensitivity analyses on the permanent displacement and the dynamic factor of safety\nof landslides are studied in detail. Moreover, a large-scale Tangjiashan landslide that occurred in\nWenchuan earthquake is investigated to verify the robustness and precision of the present method.\nIt is found that the results from the present method is in good agreement with those from the\nprevious method.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xiaoping Zhou [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Qihu Qian, Hao Cheng, Haipeng Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "pseudo-dynamic factor of safety, slices method, inertia force, damping force, sliding displacement, displacement-pseudo-dynamic model, two-dimensional landslides, seismic loads", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 3, June, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Jul 2019"}
