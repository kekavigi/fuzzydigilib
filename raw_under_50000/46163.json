{"Nomor": 46163, "Judul": "METAL - ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS AS CHEMICAL NANOREACTORS: SYNTHESIS AND STABILIZATION OF CATALYTICALLY ACTIVE METAL SPECIES IN CONFINED SPACES", "Abstrak": "Since the advent of the first metal?organic frameworks\n(MOFs), we have witnessed an explosion of captivating architectures with\nexciting physicochemical properties and applications in a wide range of fields.\nThis, in part, can be understood under the light of their rich host?guest chemistry\nand the possibility to use single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) as a basic\ncharacterization tool. Moreover, chemistry on preformed MOFs, applying recent\ndevelopments in template-directed synthesis and postsynthetic methodologies\n(PSMs), has shown to be a powerful synthetic tool to (i) tailor MOFs channels of\nknown topology via single-crystal to single-crystal (SC-SC) processes, (ii) impart\nhigher degrees of complexity and heterogeneity within them, and most\nimportantly, (iii) improve their capabilities toward applications with respect to\nthe parent MOFs. However, the unique properties of MOFs have been, somehow,\nlimited and underestimated. This is clearly reflected on the use of MOFs as\nchemical nanoreactors, which has been barely uncovered.
