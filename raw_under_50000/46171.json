{"Nomor": 46171, "Judul": "IN SITU BIOSYNTHESIZED SUPERPARAMAGNETIC IRON OXIDE NANOPARTICLES (SPIONS) INDUCE EFFICIENT HYPERTHERMIA IN CANCER CELLS", "Abstrak": "Despite the promising role of magnetic hyperthermia in\ncancer therapy, its use in patients has been restricted by hurdles that\ninclude inefficient targeting of magnetic particles to the tumor site,\nlimited bioavailability, and high toxicity, etc. Taking advantage of the\nunique metabolic property of cancer cells, we explored the potential of\nthese cells to biosynthesize magnetic nanoparticles for potential\nhyperthermia applications. Treatment of cancer cells with a mixture of\nFeCl2 and zinc gluconate resulted in a significant increase in intracellular\nFe and Zn content in these cells. Exposure of these cells to an alternating\nmagnetic field (AMF) for 30 min resulted in a substantial temperature\nrise of 5?6 \u00b0C. The in situ formed particles were identified as iron oxide\nand ZnO nanoparticles. Based on the magnetic property and size, the\niron oxide nanoparticles were classified as superparamagnetic iron oxide\nnanoparticles (SPIONS) comprising a mixture of magnetite (Fe3-?O4) and maghemite (?-Fe2O3). The role of reactive oxygen species (H2O2) and the involvement of the glycolytic pathway in the biosynthesis of the nanoparticles were confirmed using appropriate in vitro studies. The simplicity of treatment, the specificity of cells capable of synthesis of SPIONS, and the hyperthermia response observed in cancer cells indicate a promising strategy to achieve effective magnetic hyperthermia for cancer therapy.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Swati Kaushik [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jijo Thomas, Vineeta Panwar, Hasan Ali, Vianni Chopra, Anjana Sharma, Ruchi Tomar, and Deepa Ghosh"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "magnetic nanoparticles, magnetic hyperthermia, SPIONS, in situ biosynthesis, cancer therapy", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Feb 2020"}
