{"Nomor": 45019, "Judul": "Oil Emulsions in Naturally Fractured Porous Media", "Abstrak": "Most of the studies regarding the formation and stability of emulsions focus on the conditioning and management of crude oil on surface facilities. Since a great deal of the crude oil produced is in the form of stable\nemulsions, it is often claimed that these emulsions are formed through chokes and other flow constrictions in oil\nfield equipment. However, emulsions are produced in wells, which not only lack these constrictions but also are\nproduced at low flow rates, demonstrating the fact that emulsions can be formed within the well itself. The\npresent work reviews the literature regarding the formation and properties of heavy and extra-heavy oil\nemulsions in naturally fractured porous media due to the current relevance that these types of crude oil exploitation take, satisfying the hydrocarbon energy demand. Moreover, emulsions have received more attention\nrecently since they can be formed in-situ and improve oil recovery. To understand the flow mechanics of\nemulsions in porous media, different models to describe their transportation are presented. Finally, the formation of emulsions in the reservoir for enhanced oil recovery purposes, including the use of nanoparticlestabilized emulsions is discussed", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "A.\tPAULINA G\u00d3MORA-FIGUEROA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Rodolfo G.
