{"Nomor": 40923, "Judul": "Investigation of bacterial community diversity in water of Zoige Alpine Wetland", "Abstrak": "Spatial isolation is currently thought to represent one of the major factors resulting in bacteria genetic\nvariation and population abundance. The bacterial diversity in a distinct environment Zoige Alpine Wetland\nlocated in the northeast of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau with the altitude 3400 m on average aroused\nour great attention. This area belongs to Qinghai-Tibetan cold climate zone with the mean annual temperature\nabout 1 C. Although several studies on bacterial diversity in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau had been\nreported, there is no report on wetland water in this area. In this work, six water samples were collected\nand the water qualities including CODCr, NH\u00fe4\n-N; NO\n3 -N; NO\n2 -N, TN, TP, TOC were investigated, of which\nresults indicated that more than 80% samples sorted as II\u2013V class of surface water sources according to\nthe National Water Quality Standard of China (GB3838-2002). Comparison of bacterial communities\namong the six samples was analyzed by DGGE of PCR-amplified 16S rDNA with universal bacterial primer\nsets. The profiles demonstrated that samples from the Flower Lake had more DNA bands than the Conservatory Station inferring higher diversity. In addition, the samples from the same environment shared\nsimilar compositions of bacterial communities. Bacterial community composition and predominant bacteria\nwere analyzed by 16S rDNA clone library. The dominant group was Proteobacteria (51.6% of the total\nclones, which contained 24.2% alpha proteobacteria, 14.5% beta proteobacteria and 12.9% gamma proteobacteria). And the Bacteroidetes added to 17.7%, Verrucomicrobia to 4.8%. More than 24.2% of the total clones showed high similarity to uncultured bacteria. The above work provides some information on bacterial diversity for special site of spatial isolation.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Chen Xi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Feng Shugeng, Zhang Hongxun, Wang Yanfen, Bai Zhihui, Gu Likun"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Zoige Alpine Wetland, Bacterial diversity, PCR-DGGE, 16S rDNA clone library, ARDRA", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Jul 2019"}
