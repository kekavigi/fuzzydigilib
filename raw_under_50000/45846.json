{"Nomor": 45846, "Judul": "Adsorption performance of standard biochar materials against volatile organic compounds in air: A case study using benzene and methyl ethyl ketone", "Abstrak": "Recently, biochars have been proposed as highly efficient and low-cost media for the adsorptive removal of\nvarious hazardous compounds. However, there is a dearth of literature focusing on adsorption performance of\nbiochars against gaseous volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In light of this limitation, the adsorption performances of 12 standard biochars made of six different raw materials (i.e., Miscanthus straw pellets, oil seed rape straw pellets, .....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Kumar Vikranta [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ki-Hyun Kima, Wanxi Peng, Shengbo Geb, Yong Sik Ok"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Adsorption, Biochars, Pollution control, Volatile,organic compounds, Air pollution", "Sumber": "Chemical Engineering Journal journal, www.elsevier.com/locate/cej", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Jan 2020"}
