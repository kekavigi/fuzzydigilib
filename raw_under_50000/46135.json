{"Nomor": 46135, "Judul": "ACTIVITY-BASED SENSING OF S?DEPALMITOYLASES: CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGIES AND BIOLOGICAL DISCOVERY", "Abstrak": "While lipids were first appreciated as a critical hydrophobic barrier, our\nunderstanding of their roles at the cellular and organismal levels continues to grow. Not\nonly are they important independent operators, providing a platform for both static and\ndynamic organization and communication within the cell, they also exert significant\neffects via the chemical modification of proteins. Addition of a lipid post-translational\nmodification (PTM) alters protein hydrophobicity and behavior, with distinct\nconsequences for subcellular trafficking, localization, intra- and intermolecular\ninteractions, and stability. One of the most abundant and widespread protein lipidation\nevents is S-acylation, installation of a long-chain lipid to the thiol of a cysteine side chain\nthrough a thioester linkage. S-Acylation is often referred to as S-palmitoylation, due to\nthe prevalence of palmitate as the lipid modification. Unlike many lipid PTMs, Sacylation\nis enzymatically reversible, enabling the cell to tune proteome-wide properties\nthrough dynamic alterations in protein lipidation status. While much has been uncovered\nabout the molecular effects of S-acylation and its implications for physiology, current\nbiochemical and chemical methods only assess substrate lipidation levels or steady-state levels of enzyme activity. Yet, the writer protein acyl transferases (PATs) and eraser acyl protein thioesterases (APTs) are dynamically active, responsible for sometimesrapid changes in S-palmitoylation status of target proteins. Thus, to understand the full scope, significance, and subtlety of Sdeacylation and its regulation in the cell, it is necessary to observe the timing and cellular geography of regulatory enzyme activities.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Saara-Anne Azizi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Rahul S.
