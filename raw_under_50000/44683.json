{"Nomor": 44683, "Judul": "The Analysis of Tram Tracks Geometric Layout Based on Mobile Satellite Measurements", "Abstrak": "In this article, the results of the research in a\nfield of which uses active global navigation satellite system\n(GNSS) geodetic networks for the inventory of geodetic\ngeometric tram tracks are presented. The applied measurement technique has been adapted for the designing\nof the geometric layout of tram tracks. Several configurations of receivers and settings of an active GNSS networks\nwith the objective to increase the accuracy of positioning\nand the availability of accurate localization are investigated. The measurement methods are optimized in order to\nincrease the accuracy of determining positions from 3 mm\nup to 6 mm. Thus, the study of deformations in geometric\nlayouts\u2014according to the authors\u2014is already possible.\nThe implementation techniques of the mobile satellite\nmeasurements in a field of tram track inventory process are\npresented in this article. The course of the measurements\nand the results of the inventory of the tram system in\nGdansk, Poland have been discussed. The results have\nturned out to be extremely useful for the geometric track\nlayout evaluation. It has been proved that the applied\nmethod allows a comprehensive tram network inventory to\nbe performed based on satellite measurements. The presented method is fast and cost-efficient.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Cezary Spech [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["\u2022 Wladyslaw Koc  \u2022 Piotr Chrostowski  \u2022 Jacek Szmaglinski"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering of railroads & roads", "Kata Kunci": "Urban transit  Tramways  Satellite measurements  Geometric layou", "Sumber": "Urban Rail Transit (2017) 3(4):214\u2013226", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Okt 2019"}
