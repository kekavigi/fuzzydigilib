{"Nomor": 44773, "Judul": "Lattices of Hydrodynamically Interacting Flapping Swimmers", "Abstrak": "Fish schools and bird flocks exhibit complex collective dynamics whose self-organization principles are\nlargely unknown. The influence of hydrodynamics on such collectives has been relatively unexplored\ntheoretically, in part due to the difficulty in modeling the temporally long-lived hydrodynamic interactions\nbetween many dynamic bodies. We address this through a novel discrete-time dynamical system (iterated map) that describes the hydrodynamic interactions between flapping swimmers arranged in one- and twodimensional lattice formations. Our 1D results exhibit good agreement with previously published\nexperimental data, in particular predicting the bistability of schooling states and new instabilities that\ncan be probed in experimental settings. For 2D lattices, we determine the formations for which swimmers\noptimally benefit from hydrodynamic interactions.We thus obtain the following hierarchy: while a side-byside single-row \u201cphalanx\u201d formation offers a small improvement over a solitary swimmer, 1D in-line and\n2D rectangular lattice formations exhibit substantial improvements, with the 2D diamond lattice offering\nthe largest hydrodynamic benefit. Generally, our self-consistent modeling framework may be broadly\napplicable to active systems in which the collective dynamics is primarily driven by a fluid-mediated\nmemory.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Anand U.
