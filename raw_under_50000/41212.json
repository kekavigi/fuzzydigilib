Then the\ninfluences of various parameters on central deflection of the diaphragm, stress distribution and\ncapacitance of pressure sensor with a time-dependent pressure are examined. Several case studies\nare compared with simulations to confirm the proposed method. The analytical results compared\nwith ABAQUS simulation show excellent agreement with the simulation results. This method is\nvery promising for time saving in calculating micro-device characteristics.", "Daftar File": {"2015 EJRNL PP Marzieh Molla-Alipour 1.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/178238"}, "Penulis": "Marzieh Molla-Alipour [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Bahram Azizollah Ganji"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "capacitive pressure sensor, circular diaphragm, deflection, analytical model, theoretical analysis", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 4, August, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Jul 2019"}
