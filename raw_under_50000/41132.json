Based on\nthe crystal plasticity theory and thermal kinematics, an improved integration model is presented.\nIn this model, the elastic deformation gradient is the integration variable of the governing equation,\nwhich contains not only the elastic deformation but also the thermal effects. In the coupled thermo-\nmechanical process, this model can reveal the evolution of microstructures such as the rotation\nof a single crystal and the slip systems in each of them. The plastic behavior of the boron steel\ncan be well described by the presented model.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Dan Z hao  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Y ig uo Z hu,  L iang Ying, Ping Hu, Ying Chang, Wanxi Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "crystal plasticity, integration model, 22MnB5 boron steel, high temperature de- formation", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 27, No. 6, December, 2014", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Jul 2019"}
