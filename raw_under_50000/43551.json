{"Nomor": 43551, "Judul": "PERFORMANCE STUDY OF AN OPTIMIZED TESLA TURBINE USING COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS", "Abstrak": "A currently popular technology that is applicable for intermediate and\nlow-temperature energy sources is the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC). One of the\nmain components of ORC systems is the expander. Tesla turbine is a type of\nexpander that typically offers better reliability. However, it offers lower\nefficiency and power output than other commercial ORC expanders. One of the\nmost recent research into the Tesla turbine is a power and efficiency optimization\nof a new design of Tesla turbine. Their study uses a relatively simple Engineering\nEquation Solver (EES). To prove the efficiency and power generation claims of\nthat research, a more robust Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis is\nconducted in this study.\nThe methodology of this research consists of model generation and setup,\ncomputation, validation, and analysis of the simulation results. The validation\nprocess includes a residual convergence assessment, conservation checks, and\nvariable of interests monitoring. The validation process continues with a check\non the validity of the turbulence model by monitoring dimensionless wall\ndistance value and Mach number at the throat section.\nCFD simulation result shows that the optimized turbine generates 47.827\nW of power with an efficiency of 50.95%, which is lower than 54 W and 61%,\nfrom the solutions from the EES study. This study also confirms that most of the\nassumptions used in the EES study accurately describe the flow inside the Tesla\nturbine.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Darryl Farhan [13115155]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
