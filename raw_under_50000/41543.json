In the context of these studies basic problems related to the development of advanced large-capacity aircraft of a flying-wing (FW) configuration have been studied at TsAGI since the late-1980s (Symposium on \u201cAeronautical Technology in XXI Century\u201d, Moscow, September 1989; Conceptual design for passenger airplane of very large capacity in \u201cflying wing\u201d layout, ICAS 96-4.6.1, 1996). In the present paper primary emphasis is placed on the rationale of selecting FW main design solutions, aerodynamic configuration, structural concept as well as on development and analysis of alternative configurations. Consideration is also given to the problem, which is in the opinion of experts the most critical for this airplane type, namely, meeting FAR-25 standards with respect to airplane operation in emergency situations. At present the work on this concept is being conducted under the International Scientific and Technical Center grant No. 548. The project collaborators are AIRBUS INDUSTRIE and Boeing.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "A.L Bolsunovsky [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["N.PBuzoverya, B.IGurevich, V.E Denisov, A.I Dunaevsky, L.M Shkadov, O.VSonin,  A.J Udzhuhu,  J.P Zhurihin"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Other branches of engineering", "Kata Kunci": "Flying wing", "Sumber": "Aircraft Design Volume 4, Issue 4, December 2001, Pages 193-219", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Agu 2019"}
