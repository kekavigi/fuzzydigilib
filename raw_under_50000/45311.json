{"Nomor": 45311, "Judul": "A WIDE STAR-BLACK HOLE BINARY SYSTEM FROM RAPID-VELOCITY MEASUREMENT", "Abstrak": "All stellar-mass black holes have hitherto been identifed by X-rays emitted from gas that is accreting onto the black hole from a companion star. These systems are all binaries with a black-hole mass that is less than 30 times that of the Sun1\u20134. Theory predicts, however, that X-ray-emitting systems form a minority of the total population of star\u2013black-hole binaries5,6. When the black hole is not accreting gas, it can be found through radial-velocity measurements of the motion of the companion star. Here we report radial-velocity measurements taken over two years of the Galactic B-type star, LB-1. We fnd that the motion of the B star and an accompanying H? emission linerequire the presence of a dark companion with a mass of 68?13+11 solar masses, which can only be a black hole. The long orbital period of 78.9 days shows that this is a wide binary system. Gravitational-wave experiments have detected black holes of similar mass, but the formation of such massive ones in a high-metallicity environment would be extremely challenging within current stellar evolution theories", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "JINGENG, LIU [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["HAOTONG, ZHANG"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Astronomi", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "BLACK HOLE", "Sumber": "| Nature | Vol 575 | 28 November 2019", "Staf Input/Edit": "pustaka bosscha", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Des 2019"}
