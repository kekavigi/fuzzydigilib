{"Nomor": 44684, "Judul": "Research on Vertical Coupling Dynamics of Monorail Vehicle at Finger-Band", "Abstrak": "In view of the fact that exhibits monorail transportation in recent years, the good situation and the lack of\nstraddle-type monorail vehicle vertical dynamics research,\nthe key problems of vertical vibration were studied in this\npaper: The vertical coupling is between walking tires and\nfinger-band. A dynamic model based on the vertical equivalent stiffness of tire is proposed, the force mode of the tire is\ndetermined through the comparison calculation and the\ndynamics model between walking tires and finger band was\nestablished on ADAMS Dynamics Software. By dynamic\ncalculation, the vibration of four running wheels in time and\nfrequency domains is obtained, and the vibration of the front\naxle of the front bogie is studied in detail; the correctness of\nthe model is confirmed by comparing with the real vehicle\ntest. Finally, the limitations of this paper and the direction of\nfollow-up work are discussed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zhouzhou Xu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zixue Du2   \u2022 Zhen Yang1   \u2022 Liang Che"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering of railroads & roads", "Kata Kunci": "Monorail  Vertical coupling dynamics Finger-band equivalent  Stiffness  Adams", "Sumber": "Urban Rail Transit (2017) 3(3):142\u2013148", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Okt 2019"}
