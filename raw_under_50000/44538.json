The interoperability that has occurred are\ndone by creating a brand new architecture that has a function to\nallow existing E-Gov applications to be able to communicate\nwith each other. E-Govs in Indonesia are developed separately by\nthe respective governments, i.e. central (national) and local\n(province, district/city). Therefore, interoperability and data\nintegration have such a restriction.\nThis paper focused on creating an Enterprise Architecture\nFramework (EAF) for interoperability and data integration on EGov applications in Indonesia. This EAF combines the approach\nof Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Event Driven\nArchitecture (EDA). The purpose of this combination is to\nproduce EAF that is real-time, the relationship between the oneto-many services, and the message transmission models that are\nasynchronous. The services provided and the events that are used\nto trigger are defined by using Web Service Definition Language\n(WSDL), while the orchestration mechanism that occurs between\nservices is defined by using the Business Process Execution\nLanguage (BPEL). BPEL is conducted by the Government\nService Bus (GSB). To evaluate this EAF, the model of services\nwhich has been defined using a variety of data is measured based\non execusion time.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Aris Puji Widodo [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jazi Eko Istiyanto , Retantyo Wardoyo , and  Purwo Santoso"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Architecture", "Kata Kunci": "Enterprise Architecture, E-Gov, SOA, EDA, Real Time Architecture.", "Sumber": "International Journal of Computer Science Issues (IJCSI); Mahebourg Vol. 10, Iss. 1,  (Jan 2013): 469-477", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Okt 2019"}
