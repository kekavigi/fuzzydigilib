{"Nomor": 44842, "Judul": "An Experimental Study On The Internal Corrosion Of A Subsea Multiphase Pipeline", "Abstrak": "Based on the actual operational parameters of a subsea multiphase pipeline, an experimental study\non the internal corrosion of a subsea multiphase pipeline was conducted in a dynamic, hightemperature autoclave, which had a similar environment to an actual field environment, using the\npartial pressure of CO2 (PCO2), velocity of the corrosion medium, temperature, corrosion time, and\ncorrosion inhibitor as variables. The results show that CO2 resulted in severe localized corrosion and\nthat the corrosion rate increased as the PCO2 and velocity increased; the corrosion rate first\nincreased and then decreased with increasing temperature. The corrosion rate peaked at approximately 65 C and then decreased continuously afterwards; the corrosion rate decreased as the\nduration of the experimental period increased. Under the operational conditions of the selected\nsubsea pipeline, localized corrosion caused by CO2 was still the primary corrosion risk. Several\ntypes of corrosion inhibitors could inhibit the occurrence of localized corrosion for a short time\nperiod; however, most corrosion inhibitors could not completely inhibit localized corrosion", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SHANGBI PENG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zhaoxiong Zeng"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "Subsea pipeline, Internal corrosion, Experiment, Corrosion inhibitor", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 1, Pages 75-81 (March  2015), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.04.003", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Nov 2019"}
