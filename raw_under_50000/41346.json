{"Nomor": 41346, "Judul": "Carbon flux dynamics and its environmental controlling factors in a desert steppe", "Abstrak": "Net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange (NEE) above a desert steppe in Inner Mongolia was measured\nwith eddy covariance technique in growing season of 2008. Environmental factors were also observed\nduring the same period. Our results show that the minimum of growing season daily cumulative NEE\nappeared on August 26 (1.6 g Cm2), while the maximum appeared on June 11 (0.9 g Cm2). Monthly\ncumulative NEE distributed in the growing season unevenly. The minimum of monthly cumulative NEE\nappeared in June (0.74 g Cm2); the maximum appeared in September (14.94 g Cm2). The sum of\nthe growing season NEE was 45.5 g Cm2. The most important environmental factor affecting the\nhalf-hour average NEE was photosynthetically active radiation. The most important environmental factor\naffecting the daily cumulative NEE was 20\u201330 cm soil water content.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Wang Zhan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wang Yuhui"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Carbon flux, Desert steppe, Eddy covariance", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect, Acta Ecologica Sinica 31 (2011) 49\u201354", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Agu 2019"}
