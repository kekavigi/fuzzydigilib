{"Nomor": 44732, "Judul": "Fractional Hydrodynamic Memory and Superdiffusion in Tilted Washboard Potentials", "Abstrak": "Diffusion in tilted washboard potentials can paradoxically exceed free normal diffusion. The effect\nbecomes much stronger in the underdamped case due to inertial effects. What happens upon inclusion of\nusually neglected fractional hydrodynamics memory effects (Basset-Boussinesq frictional force), which\nresult in a heavy algebraic tail of the velocity autocorrelation function of the potential-free diffusion making\nit transiently superdiffusive?Will a giant enhancement of diffusion become even stronger, and the transient\nsuperdiffusion last even longer? These are the questions that we answer in this Letter based on an accurate numerical investigation. We show that a resonancelike enhancement of normal diffusion becomes indeed much stronger and sharper. Moreover, a long-lasting transient regime of superdiffusion, including\nRichardson-like diffusion, h?x2\u00f0t\u00dei ? t3 and ballistic supertransport, h?x\u00f0t\u00dei ? t2, is revealed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "IGOR GOYCHUK [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 123, 180603 (2019), APS", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari \u00a0\n                                     Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Nov 2019"}
