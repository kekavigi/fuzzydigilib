{"Nomor": 45981, "Judul": "A temperature-controlled stage for laser scanning confocal microscopy and case studies in materials science", "Abstrak": "If confocal microscopy is an ubiquitous tool in life science, its applications in chemistry and materials science are still, in comparison, very limited. Of particular\ninterest in these domains is the use of confocal microscopy to investigate temperature-dependent phenomena such as self-assembly, diffusio- or thermophoresis, or\ncrystal growth. Several hurdles must be solved to develop a temperature-controlled stage for laser scanning confocal microscopy, in particular regarding the influence\nof an elevated temperature gradient close to the microscope objective, which most people try very hard to avoid. Here we report the design of a temperaturecontrolled\nstage able to generate stable temperature gradients in both positive and negative temperature range and does not require use of liquid nitrogen. Our setup\nprovides an excellent control of the temperature gradient, which can be coupled with a controlled displacement of the sample, making it useful in particular for a\nvariety of solidification, chemistry, and interfacial problems. We illustrate the benefits of our setup with several case studies of interest in chemistry and materials\nscience: the 3D real-time imaging of ice growth, the segregation of hard particles by growing crystals, the freezing behaviour of single emulsions, the self-shaping of\noil droplets upon cooling, and the self-assembly of amphiphile molecules into helical structures. These results show how confocal microscopy coupled with a\ntemperature-controlled stage that provides a controlled temperature gradient is a welcome addition to the toolkit of chemists and materials scientists.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Dmytro Dedovetsa [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["C\u00e9cile Monteuxb, Sylvain Deville"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "laser scanning confocal microscopy, case studies in materials science", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Feb 2020"}
