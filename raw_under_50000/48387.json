{"Nomor": 48387, "Judul": "KNOWLEDGE ASSESSMENT OF COSMETIC CONTAINING CANNABIS SATIVA AND ACTIVITY AND TOXICITY PREDICTION OF CANNABINOID COMPOUNDS", "Abstrak": "The development of Cannabis sativa-based cosmetic products is emerging in developed countries.\nThe most popular compound for this purpose is Cannabidiol as anti-inflammatory and moisturizing\nagent. However, World Health Organization and various research studies had reported its adverse\neffects. On the other hand, legality issue of Cannabis sativa uses in some countries also emerge.\nThe aims of this research were to assess the knowledge of university students regarding the\ncosmetic and Cannabis sativa-based cosmetics and to determine the alternative compounds from\nCannabis sativa and cannabimimetic compounds. Assessment of knowledge was done through\nquestionnaire followed by the analysis through Microsoft Excel and SPSS. For computational\nmethod, the crystal complex of CB1 and AM841 (PDB ID:5XR8) was redocked using AutoDock 4.2.\nTwenty-four test compounds and four comparison compounds were prepared and optimized using\nGaussView 5.0 and Gussian 09W. Docking process of ligands with CB1 Receptor were done using\nAutoDock 4.2 with grid box (30x30x30) and coordinate (-45.089, -160.511, 308.674). Potential\ncompounds with lower binding energy than endocannabinoid, Cannabidiol, and AM-841 were\nselected for further analysis. The toxicity prediction was done using Toxtree and ECOSAR. Based on\nthe result of knowledge assessment, above half of the sample size (265 people) had answered the\nquestions correctly with correct answers above 50% from total questions. The selection of cosmetic\nproducts without knowing and understanding the composition was high (53%), so respondents\nsupported the education through leaflets (38%). The popularity of Cannabis sativa-based cosmetic\nproducts was low (4%). Based on the result of computational method, the compounds with low\nbinding energy and low toxicity especially for skin were Tetrahydrocannabinolic Acid (-10.29\nKcal/mol), Perrottetinene (-10.06 Kcal/mol), and AM-4056 (-11.96 Kcal/mol). However, these\ncompounds are predicted to contribute to environmental and aquatic toxicity. Thus, further\nresearch on safe concentrations for humans and the environment needed to be done.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Raden Ajeng Diana Rosalia": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/208128"}, "Penulis": "Raden Ajeng Diana Rosalia [11616108]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. rer. nat.
