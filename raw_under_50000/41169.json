First, by using the\ncomplex Fourier transform, the dislocation problem can be solved and the stress fields are obtained\nwith Cauchy singularity at the location of dislocation. The dislocation solution is utilized to derive\nintegral equations for multiple interacting cracks in the orthotropic half-plane with functionally\ngraded orthotropic coating. Several examples are solved and dynamic stress intensity factors are\nobtained.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "M. M. Monfared  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["M.
