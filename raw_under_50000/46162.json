{"Nomor": 46162, "Judul": "ACTIVITY-BASED SENSING FOR SITE-SPECIFIC PROTEOMIC ANALYSIS OF CYSTEINE OXIDATION", "Abstrak": "Oxidative post-translational modifications\n(OxiPTMs) of cysteine residues are the molecular foundation\nof thiol-based redox regulation that modulates physiological\nevents such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration\nand, when dysregulated, can lead to biomolecule damage and\ncell death. Common OxiPTMs of cysteine thiols (?SH)\ninclude reversible modifications such as S-sulfenylation\n(?SOH), S-glutathionylation (?SSG), disulfide formation\n(?SSR), S-nitrosylation (?SNO), and S-sulfhydration\n(?SSH) as well as more biologically stable modifications\nlike S-sulfinylation (?SO2H) and S-sulfonylation (?SO3H).\nIn the past decade, our laboratory has developed first-in-class chemistry-based tools and proteomic methods to advance the field of thiol-based redox biology and oxidative stress. In this Account, we take the reader through the historical aspects of probe development and application in our laboratory, highlighting key advances in our understanding of sulfur chemistry, in the test tube and in living systems.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yunlong Shi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Kate S.
