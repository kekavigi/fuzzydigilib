Among several hydrogen\nstorages, ammonia is considered promising due to high hydrogen density, stability,\nand total energy efficiency. Adopting ammonia as fuel in vehicles requires a proper\nfuel tank design to fulfill the required volumetric content and safety standards,\nwithout neglecting the economic objectives. In obtaining a pressure vessel that\npasses all safety standards, several tests are needed to be done; one of the tests is a\nburst test. In general, the type-IV pressure vessel is utilized as a fuel tank because\nit is the lightest compared to other types of pressure vessels. This research focuses\non the effort to develop a lightweight type-IV ammonia pressure vessel designed\nfor mobility for burst test. The material combination (liner and composite) and\ncomposite stacking sequence are analyzed for burst test by using the finite element\nmethod. Two polymer materials of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and\nPolypropylene (PP) are evaluated as the liner considering its ultimate tensile\nstrength, density, cost, and compatibility with ammonia. While carbon fiber\nreinforced polymer (CFRP) and glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) are adopted\nas a composite skin. Also, five composite stacking sequences are analyzed in this\nstudy. Von-Mises stress and Hashin's damage initiation criteria are used to evaluate\nthe performance of liner and composite, respectively. As a result, PP-based pressure\nvessels generate lower stress in the liner compared to PET-based. Besides, CFRPbased\npressure vessels have a higher safety margin and can generate lower stress in\nthe liner and lower damage initiation criteria in the composite skin. The material\ncombination of PP-CFRP with a stacking sequence of [\u00b151]1s gives the lowest\nmaximum stress in the liner during the burst test.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Alvin Reynaldo [13616053]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
