{"Nomor": 45009, "Judul": "Single- and Two-Phase Flow Model in Low-Permeability Reservoir", "Abstrak": "In petroleum development, low-permeability reservoir means having permeability of porous media\nlower than 50 micro-Darcy. The mathematical model of liquid flow in low-permeability reservoirs has\nbeen difficult to describe for a long time, and an ideal model has not been available until now because of\nthe threshold pressure gradient. With the boundary adhesion layer model of a micro-channel as basis, a\nnew liquid flow model was derived for low-permeability reservoirs in this study. The no-movement\nliquid layer close to the solid surface was defined as the boundary adhesion layer regarded as the\nnegative slip length. Using the exponential function of the boundary stick layer to the pressure drop\ngradient, the formulae of the liquid velocity and flow rate of a round channel were derived. The liquid\nflows model in low permeability reservoirs was then obtained. Finally, the flow model was tested by\nexamples, and applications to a low-permeability reservoir were demonstrated. The analysis results\nshow that the new non-linear model of liquid flows exhibits clear physical definition, and can be easily\nused to describe liquid flows in low-permeability media.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SONG FUQUAN [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Song Xingxing", "Wang Yong", "Sun Yeheng"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "Low-permeability reservoirs; Non-linear flow; Boundary adhesion layer; Model of liquid flows", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 5, Issue 2, Pages 183-190 (June  2019), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.05.004", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Nov 2019"}
