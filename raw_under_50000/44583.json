{"Nomor": 44583, "Judul": "Environmental Health Condition and Community Healthy Behavior in the Radon Radiation Exposure Area", "Abstrak": "Radon is a natural radioactive gas, which is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. Radon rises\nto the earth\u2019s surface through a natural decaying process of uranium found in all\nenvironments. Exposure to radon has an effect on health. The research approach is\nqualitative and supported by a certified air and water test sampling method. The\npopulation is the community located in an area exposed to radon radiation with low,\nnormal, or high categories. The research result corroborates that the water coming from\nsprings and wells remains safe for use, as it remains below the standard of the radon\ncontamination level for drinking water. The radon concentration in the spring is higher\nthan in the well because the soil\u2019s geological structure is limestone rock. The air\nconditions inside and outside the room remain safe for the people because it is below the\nstandard of radon contamination level. Lime dust is detected as a limestone mining\nimpact, which is prone to noise and landslides. Moreover, the community\u2019s poor health\nbehavior could affect their health. In conclusion, the studied area is categorized as low\nradon exposure. However, if community health behavior remains poor, radon radiation\nexposure will affect the community\u2019s health.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Bintarsih Sekarningrum [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Suhardjo Sitam"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Radiation Exposure, Radon, Environmental Health, Health Behavior", "Sumber": "Review of Integrative Business and Economics Research, suppl.
