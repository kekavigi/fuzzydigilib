{"Nomor": 46111, "Judul": "BUILDING BIOLOGICAL FLASHLIGHTS: ORTHOGONAL LUCIFERASES AND LUCIFERINS FOR IN VIVO IMAGING", "Abstrak": "Bioluminescence is widely used for real-time imaging in living\norganisms. This technology features a light-emitting reaction between enzymes\n(luciferases) and small molecule substrates (luciferins). Photons produced from\nluciferase?luciferin reactions can penetrate through heterogeneous tissue,\nenabling readouts of physiological processes. Dozens of bioluminescent probes\nare now available and many are routinely used to monitor cell proliferation,\nmigration, and gene expression patterns in vivo.\nDespite the ubiquity of bioluminescence, traditional applications have been\nlargely limited to imaging one biological feature at a time. Only a handful of\nluciferase?luciferin pairs can be easily used in tandem, and most are poorly\nresolved in living animals. Efforts to develop spectrally distinct reporters have\nbeen successful, but multispectral imaging in large organisms remains a\nformidable challenge due to interference from surrounding tissue. Consequently,\na lack of well-resolved probes has precluded multicomponent tracking. An expanded collection of bioluminescent probes would\nprovide insight into processes where multiple cell types drive physiological tasks, including immune function and organ\ndevelopment....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Sierra J.
