{"Nomor": 46098, "Judul": "ULTRASOUND-ASSISTED MIR-122-LOADED POLYMERIC NANODROPLETS FOR HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA GENE THERAPY", "Abstrak": "Ultrasound-induced microbubble sonoporation has\nbeen shown to effectively improve drug/gene delivery efficiency by\nenhancing tissue and cell permeability. However, the microscale\nsize and short duration of ultrasound contrast agents limit their\naccumulation in target areas. Here, a kind of ultrasound-triggered\nphase-transitioning and size-changing cationic nanodroplet, perfluoropentane/\nC9F17-PAsp(DET)/miR-122/poly(glutamic acid)-\ng-MeO-poly(ethylene glycol) (PGA-g-mPEG) ternary nanodroplets\n(PFP-TNDs/miR-122), was developed to deliver microRNA-\n122 (miR-122) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment.\nPFP served as an ultrasound-sensitive core for ultrasound-triggered\nphase transition and size change from the nanoscale to the\nmicroscale. Positively charged C9F17-PAsp(DET) ensured adequate miRNA loading. PGA-g-mPEG, which served as the shell of the nanodroplet, modified the nanodroplets, enhanced their stability in serum, and protected miR-122 from degradation in vivo. The results exhibited that PFP-TNDs/miR-122 has a nanosize diameter (362 \u00b1 15 nm) and remained stable for 24 h. After treatment with PFP-TNDs/miR-122 combined with ultrasound irradiation, the miR-122 expression level was significantly increased by approximately 600-fold in HepG2 cells, 500-fold in SMMC-7721 cells, and 30-fold in human HCC xenografts. Moreover, PFPTNDs/ miR-122 combined with ultrasound radiation effectively suppressed the growth, migration, and invasion of HCC cells, and inhibited tumor proliferation in mice. This study revealed that the biodegradable PFP-TNDs is a promising therapeutic gene carrier with functions of gene protection and effective gene delivery for clinical applications. Furthermore, PFP-TNDs/miR-122 associated with ultrasound irradiation may pave a new way to improve the prognosis of patients with HCC.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Huanling Guo [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ming Xu, Zhong Cao, Wei Li, Lida Chen, Xiaoyan Xie, Wei Wang, Jie Liu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "ultrasound, microRNA, gene delivery, polymeric nanodroplet, cancer therapy", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Feb 2020"}
