{"Nomor": 45185, "Judul": "Petrophysical Logs Contribute In Appraising Productive Sands Of Lower Goru Formation, Kadanwari Concession, Pakistan", "Abstrak": "The interpretation of petrophysical logs unveil the reservoir traits and augment an intuition of hydrocarbon (gas) bearing\nzones. This study focused on interpretation of petrophysical signatures (encountered in Kadanwari-01, 03, 10 and 11) of\nLower Goru Formation (LGF). LGF composed of shoreface sands and near shelf shale, deposited in Cretaceous age in middle and lower Indus basins, Pakistan. The results upshot the reservoir potential tapped in interbeded sand packages of LGF.\nThe petrophysical attributes such as shale content from radioactivity tools (GR, SGR), effective porosity from NPHI-RHOB\nresponse and average porosity, derived fluids saturation of porous sand reservoir pockets by averaging, the Wyllie\u2013Rose\npermeability of the selected producing zones and matching of respective resistivity responses (LLD, LLS) quantified in\nLGF. Lithology indicator (M\u2013N plots) and mineral identification (MID) plot provide a basis to classify the lithology of\npotential sands derived by neutron, density and sonic logs. The isoperimetric surfaces depict the spatial distribution of\nderived results of the corresponding prospect zone (PZ). A correlation from NE to SW of study area yields a lateral profile\nof physical characters and distribution of PZs. Prospect Zone-3 results exhibit good quality of reservoir sands (30\u201337 m\nthick), characterizing ?ND from 0.12 to 0.23 and Shc 0.36\u20130.6. PZ-3 and PZ-4 are evaluated best prospect zones in this study\nand may be recommended for drilling.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MUHAMMAD JAHANGIR KHAN [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Haris Ahmed Khan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Petrophysical analysis, Reservoir evaluation, Lower Goru Formation, Kadanwari", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Exploration and Production Technology, Volume 8, Issue 4, 1089-1098 (December 2018), https://doi.org/10.1007/s13202-018-0472-1", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Nov 2019"}
