By adopting the exponent model, the nonlinear differential equations for\nflux distributions are derived. The elastic solutions to stress, displacement and magnetostriction\nare analytically given. Some typical numerical results are displayed. Numerical results show that\nin the process of transport current reduction, tensile stress generally occurs in the outer region\nof the composite, and that displacement is always negative in the composite. In addition, as the\napplied maximal transport current exceeds the outer-cylinder critical current, a hysteresis loop\nof the magnetostriction exists for the full cycle of the transport current.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Qifang Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ling ling Liu, Wenjie Feng"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "mechanical behavior, transport current, cylindrical superconducting composite, exponent model, nonlinear equation", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 1, February, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Jul 2019"}
