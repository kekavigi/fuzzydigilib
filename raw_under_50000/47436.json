{"Nomor": 47436, "Judul": "RAMPING UP DELIVERY OF CARDIAC SURGERY DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: A GUIDANCE STATEMENT FROM THE SOCIETY OF THORACIC SURGEONS COVID-19 TASK FORCE", "Abstrak": "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound global impact.  Its rapid transmissibility has transformed \nhealthcare delivery and forced countries to adopt strict measures to contain its spread.  The vast majority \nof U.S. cardiac surgical programs have deferred all but truly emergent/urgent operative procedures in an \neffort to reduce the burden on the healthcare system and to mobilize resources to combat the pandemic \nsurge.  While the number of COVID-19 cases continues to increase worldwide, the incidence of new \ncases has begun to decline in many North American cities.  This \u201cflattening of the curve\u201d has prompted \ninterest in re-opening the economy, relaxing public health restrictions, and resuming non-urgent health \ncare delivery.   \n \nThe following document provides a template whereby adult cardiac surgical programs may begin to ramp \nup the care delivery in a deliberate and graded fashion as the COVID-19 pandemic burden begins to ease.  \n\u201cResuscitating\u201d the timely delivery of care is guided by three principles (Figure 1): \n1. Collaborate to permit increased case volumes, balancing the clinical needs of patients awaiting \nsurgery against the local resources available within each healthcare system. \n2. Prioritize patients awaiting elective surgery while proactively engaging all stakeholders, \nfocusing on those with high-risk anatomy, changing/symptomatic clinical status, and, once these \nvariables have been addressed, prioritizing by wait times. \n3. Re-evaluate local conditions continuously, to assess for any increase in admissions due to a \nrecrudescence of cases, to assure adequate resources to care for patients, and to monitor in\nhospital infectious transmissions to both patients and health care workers.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Daniel T.
