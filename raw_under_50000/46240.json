{"Nomor": 46240, "Judul": "PULSED ELECTRICAL STIMULATION ENHANCES BODY FLUID TRANSPORT FOR COLLAGEN BIOMINERALIZATION", "Abstrak": "Mechanical loads from physiologic activities\nsuch as walking and running generate bioelectricity in bones.\nBy mimicking bioelectricity, external electrical stimulations\nhave also been used therapeutically to stimulate bone-forming\ncells and, thus, to promote bone regeneration. However, little\nis known about the physicochemical mechanism(s) by which\nelectrical stimulations drives calcium phosphate mineralization\nof collagen. Here, we showed that, during in vitro collagen\nmineralization in the absence of cells, application of pulsed\nelectrical stimulation significantly enhanced the transport of\nionic body fluid components through a micrometer-scale\nchannel (?100?200 ?m gap space between the inner surfaces\nof tube-like collagen scaffolds and a cathode placed inside the collagen scaffolds). The enhanced transport of ionic precursors increased diffusion of the charged precursors from the channel to the inner collagen surface, where bone mineralization was otherwise restricted. The results indicate that pulsed electrical signals can locally accelerate the nucleation of calcium phosphate nanocrystals in or on collagen, allowing us to better control the spatial distribution of the nanocrystals at the microscale. The findings from this study provide insights into the utilization of electrical stimulation for applications such as facilitating bonefracture healing and designing better bone-specific biomaterials.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Doyoon Kim [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Byeongdu Lee, Brittany P.
