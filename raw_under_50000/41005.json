{"Nomor": 41005, "Judul": "Response of three new Atriplex species (Atriplex spp.) to drought and its recovery", "Abstrak": "The present study was conducted to evaluate drought stress and its recovery on the growth and biochemical\nchanges of three Atriplex species. The experiment included three Atriplex species and four irrigation regimes.\nThe results showed that light (75% field capacity) and severe drought (50% field capacity) caused significant reduction in the growth of all three Atriplex species, and no irrigation destroyed Atriplex leucoclada and Atriplex\ncanescens. Recovery could compensate some loss of weight in all three species, especially Atriplex lentiformis, so that there were significant differences between the control and 75% field capacity (FC) treatments. Tissue moisture content percentage in the control, 75% and 50% FC showed no significant difference.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hossein Sadeghi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mohammad Delaviz"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Recovery, Irrigation regimes, Catalase, Superoxide dismutase, Peroxidase", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Jul 2019"}
