{"Nomor": 40825, "Judul": "One-Shot Operational Quantum Resource Theory", "Abstrak": "A fundamental approach for the characterization and quantification of all kinds of resources is to study\nthe conversion between different resource objects under certain constraints. Here we analyze, from a\nresource-nonspecific standpoint, the optimal efficiency of resource formation and distillation tasks with\nonly a single copy of the given quantum state, thereby establishing a unified framework of one-shot\nquantum resource manipulation. We find general bounds on the optimal rates characterized by resource\nmeasures based on the smooth max- or min-relative entropies and hypothesis testing relative entropy, as\nwell as the free robustness measure, providing them with general operational meanings in terms of optimal\nstate conversion. Our results encompass a wide class of resource theories via the theory-dependent\ncoefficients we introduce, and the discussions are solidified by important examples, such as entanglement,\ncoherence, superposition, magic states, asymmetry, and thermal nonequilibrium.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zi-Wen Liu, [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Kaifeng Bu,", "and Ryuji Takagi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 123, 020401 (2019); \u00a9 2019 American Physical Society", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Jul 2019"}
