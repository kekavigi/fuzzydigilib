{"Nomor": 44693, "Judul": "Public Perception of Driverless Trains", "Abstrak": "The global trend for rail automation is increasing\nbut there are very few publications on public perception of the\nongoing changes in the railways. In order to fill this gap and to\nbetter understand people\u2019s perception of driverless trains, the\npaper focuses on automation of metro systems with a particular interest in unattended train operation (UTO). A survey\nseeking a public opinion on UTO was conducted, and the\nresults show that 93 % of female and 72 % of male respondents think that a \u2018\u2018fake\u2019\u2019 driver room should be present on a\ndriverless train. In terms of human error, a great majority of\nrespondents expressed no worries about a train design or\nmaintenance issues. However, staff communication, selected\nby 36 % males and 43 % females, and a technical failure,\nhighlighted by 50 % of males and 43 % of females, were two\nissues that raised most safety concerns amongst the respondents. Other results related to passenger\u2019s safety, employment, advantages and limitations of the UTO, amongst other\nissues, are presented and discussed in the paper", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Anna Fraszczyk [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Philip Brown \u2022 Suyi Duan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering of railroads & roads", "Kata Kunci": "Metro  Automation  Driverless train Attitudes", "Sumber": "Urban Rail Transit (2015) 1(2):78\u201386", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Okt 2019"}
