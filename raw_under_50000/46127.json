{"Nomor": 46127, "Judul": "AGGREGATION-INDUCED EMISSION LUMINOGENS FOR ACTIVITY-BASED SENSING", "Abstrak": "Fluorescent sensing has emerged as a powerful\ntool for detecting various analytes and visualizing numerous\nbiological processes by virtue of its superb sensitivity, rapidness,\nexcellent temporal resolution, easy operation, and low cost. Of\nparticular interest is activity-based sensing (ABS), a burgeoning\nsensing approach that is actualized on the basis of dynamic\nmolecular reactivity rather than conventional lock-and-key\nmolecular recognition. ABS has been recognized to possess\nsome distinct advantages, such as high specificity, extraordinary\nsensitivity, and accurate signal outputs.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Dong Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ben Zhong Tang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Emission Luminogens, Activity-Based Sensing", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Feb 2020"}
