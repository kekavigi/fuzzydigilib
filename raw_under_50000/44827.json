{"Nomor": 44827, "Judul": "Electron-phonon coupling and Kohn anomaly due to floating two-dimensional electronic bands on the surface of ZrSiS", "Abstrak": "ZrSiS, an intriguing candidate of topological nodal line semimetals, was discovered to have exotic surface\nfloating two-dimensional (2D) electrons [Phys. Rev. X 7, 041073 (2017)], which are likely to interact with\nsurface phonons. Here, we reveal a prominent Kohn anomaly in a surface phonon branch by mapping out\nthe surface phonon dispersions of ZrSiS using high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy. Theoretical\nanalysis via an electron-phonon coupling (EPC) model attributes the strong renormalization of the surface\nphonon branch to the interactions with the surface floating 2D electrons. With the random phase approximation, we calculate the phonon self-energy and evaluate the mode-specific EPC constant by fitting the experimental data. The EPC picture provided here may be important for potential applications of topological nodal line semimetals.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Siwei Xue [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Tiantian Zhang,", "Changjiang Yi,", "Shuyuan Zhang,", "Xun Jia,", "Luiz H.
