{"Nomor": 44867, "Judul": "Integrated Mineral Analysis Of Sandstone And Dolomite Formations Using Different Chelating Agents During Matrix Acidizing", "Abstrak": "Mineral analysis plays a major role in the successful matrix acidizing as it shows the change in physiochemical changes in the formation due to the reaction with fluids injected. Mineralogy of the reservoir\ncan be altered by injecting mineral acids during matrix acidizing. But various complications are connected during the application of these acids such as environmental hazards, corrosion of pipes and\ntubings, precipitation of fluosilicates and fast spending of acid. To mitigate these problems, chelating\nagents have been applied as an alternative by different researchers. In this study, three different chelating\nagents EDTA, GLDA and HEDTA were applied to stimulate sandstone and dolomite samples. The pH value\nof these chelates ranges from 1.7 to 3 and is measured before and after core flooding to observe physiochemical changes. Core flooding experiments under 180 F temperature were performed at a constant\nflow rate of 1 ml/min on core samples having dimensions (3 inch  1.5 inch). Porosity, permeability,\nInductively Coupled Plasma (ICP), and TESCAN Integrated Mineral Analysis (TIMA) were employed to\nmeasure changes in formation properties such as morphology, topology and mineralogy. The reacted\nsample of acids was analyzed for sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminium, magnesium, and iron using the\nICP technique to find the capability of these chelates to remove positive ions. HEDTA found to be effective\nin chelating iron, calcium and magnesium and it also removed some amount of aluminium ions from the\nsandstone samples. Permeability and porosity analysis concluded that HEDTA is more efficient in\ncreating new big pore spaces. TIMA analysis confirms that HEDTA is effective in dissolving quartz and\nother positive ions while dissolved a large amount of calcium and sodium from the sandstone as\ncompared to other chelates. TIMA analysis also concluded that HEDTA is effective in increasing porosity\nof sandstone formation while GLDA is effective in dolomites", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MIAN UMER SHAFIQ [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hisham Khaled Ben Mahmud", "Mohsen Ghasemi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Acidizing, Matrix, Mineral, Integrated Mineral Analysis (TIMA)", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 5, Issue 1, Pages 67-76 (March  2019), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.07.002", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Nov 2019"}
