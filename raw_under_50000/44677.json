{"Nomor": 44677, "Judul": "Tramways in Urban Areas: An Overview on Safety at Road Intersections", "Abstrak": "Although the accident number involving trams is\ncomparatively very limited to the total road accident\nnumber, the consequences of tram crashes are very serious,\nespecially when pedestrians are run over. The new power\nsupply technologies (e.g. catenary-free systems) allow to\nbuild tram networks, even in old town centres and pedestrian areas, with additional increased risk of pedestrian\ncasualties. This will require specific design solutions and\ntraffic regulations for road safety as described in this paper,\nwith particular regard to vulnerable users (i.e. pedestrians\nand cyclists), especially near intersections and pedestrian\ncrossings. Therefore, the research analyses the road accident rate and its evolution in the last 10 years with specific\nfocus on Italian tramways. The main risk conditions and\nthe strategies used worldwide to improve the safety of\ntramway system in the urban context are described. The\nmain countermeasures to reduce accident risks are aimed at\nbetter warning road users of specific risk conditions. Other\ncountermeasures are designed to install suitable facilities\non road platforms for better informing users of tramway\nsystem, for limiting or temporarily prohibiting turning\nmovements or manoeuvrings and for properly channelling\npedestrian and vehicle flows with the purpose to avoid or\nreduce interference with trams.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Marco Guerrieri [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering of railroads & roads", "Kata Kunci": "Tramway systems  Road intersections  Road safety  Urban context", "Sumber": "Urban Rail Transit (2018) 4(4):223\u2013233", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Okt 2019"}
