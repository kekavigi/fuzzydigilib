{"Nomor": 44855, "Judul": "A Modified Predictive Model For Estimating Gas Flow Rate In Horizontal Drain Hole", "Abstrak": "Accurate prediction of the flow rate of horizontal gas well is necessary for economic feasibility, planning\nand development of gas field. Most of the early models assumed that the production from the horizontal\nwell is infinitely conductive except few recent models. Some recent models reported in the literature for\nestimating flow rate in horizontal well where the pressure losses due to friction along horizontal drain\nhole was considered.\nAn improved model that checks the impact of all possible well bore pressure losses on gas production rate of horizontal well is reported. The neglected impact of well bore pressure losses due to\nfluid accumulation and kinetic energy in the past models is thought to be a conceivable reason for the\ninconsistency between computed rates from the models and rates got from production tests. The new\nmodel was validated using the same field contextual investigation utilized by Guo et al. and outcome\ngot from the new model yields more satisfactory results. A more realistic results that evident all flow\nphenomena in gas well include the initial unsteady, pseudo-steady and steady state flow condition\nhence flow rate at any given production time has been established for flow of gas along horizontal\nwell. The outcomes of the study demonstrate that the percentage deviation of the new model at\nsteady state flow condition is less than 5.0% compared with 11.05% acquired from Guo et al. model\nfollowing by 259.7% from Furui's model, and 1118.2% got from Joshi's model. This work gives field\noperators a precise and helpful device for prediction and assessment of production in a gas horizontal\nwell", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "FADAIRO ADESINA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Oladepo Adebowale", "Adeyemi Gbadegesin"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "Flow rate, Horizontal well, Unsteadiness, Steadiness, Well bore pressure losses", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 5, Issue 1, Pages 35-41 (March  2019), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.05.001", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Nov 2019"}
