{"Nomor": 47454, "Judul": "REVIEW OF  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNIQUES IN IMAGING DATA ACQUISITION, SEGMENTATION AND DIAGNOSIS FOR COVID-19", "Abstrak": "\u2014The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading all over the world. Medical imaging such as X-ray and computed tomography (CT) plays an essential role in the global fight against COVID-19, whereas the recently emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies further strengthen the power of the imaging tools and help medical specialists. We hereby review the rapid responses in the community of medical imaging (empowered by AI) toward COVID-19. For example, AI-empowered image acquisition can significantly help automate the scanning procedure and also reshape the workflow with minimal contact to patients, providing the best protection to the imaging technicians. Also, AI can improve work efficiency by accurate delineation of infections in X-ray and CT images, facilitating subsequent quantification. Moreover, the computer-aided platforms help radiologists make clinical decisions, i.e., for disease diagnosis, tracking, and prognosis. In this review paper, we thus cover the entire pipeline of medical imaging and analysis techniques involved with COVID-19, including image acquisition, segmentation, diagnosis, and follow-up", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Feng Shi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jun Wang, Jun Shi, Ziyan Wu, Qian Wang, Zhenyu Tang, Kelei He, Yinghuan Shi,  Dinggang Shen*"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "COVID-19, artificial intelligence, image acquisition, segmentation, diagnosis", "Sumber": "IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Mei 2020"}
