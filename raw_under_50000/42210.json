{"Nomor": 42210, "Judul": "THE IMPACT OF BUILDING HEIGHT ON URBAN HEAT ISLAND PHENOMENON IN AN URBANIZED AREA", "Abstrak": "Over the last decade, \u201clivability\u201d has become an increasingly popular term used in\nurban policy due to higher concern in to make a city as a desireable place to live.\nNonetheless, the rampant urbanisation has led to the changes of the land use into\nthe built-up area. A study has shown that the land cover trend in Jakarta has been\ndominated by built-up area. This large-scale changes have led to urban climate\nchange and caused an increased annual mean air temperature in a city can be 1-3 ?\nwarmer than the rural surroundings which known as urban heat island (UHI) that\nmay cause degradation environment quality.\nA study in urban microclimate is gaining importance regarding the occurrence of\nUHI since it is expected to help improving the performance of the adjacent\nbuildings with air temperature, wind flow and other climatic indicators. In the\nprevious studies, researchers have discovered that height of the buildings affects\nthe surrounding microclimate in which the temperature lapse rate can be significant\nin high-rise buildings. In contrast, increasing building height is presumably useful\nin providing shading to the environment.\nTo probe the influence of building height in the urban heating, a micro-scale urban\nmodel has been employed to study the influence of building height on the\nsurrounding UHI effect. Sudirman Central Business District (SCBD) in Jakarta,\nIndonesia was chosen as a case study due to its characteristics which its area\noccupied by mostly high-rise and skyscraper buildings. Four different simulations\nthrough numerical models in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) have been\nmade in two different season, dry and wet season. The first case was calculated\nwithout considering heat transfer, whilst the second case was calculated heat from\nvehicles in the road and building. Furthermore, in the second case, height of\nbuildings was simulated 150% higher and 50% lower than the present condition.\nThe analysis on the simulations will be examined regarding their characteristics\nbased on the urban configuration.iv\nIt is found that two of parameters on urban microclimate which are magnitude of\nvelocity and temperature distribution were generally affected by the wind inflow\ndirection and buildings configuration. Combination of the existence of tall buildings\nand narrow streets entrapped heat and reduce the air flow, resulting in high\ntemperatures as well. Considering anthropogenic heat source in the simulations was\nalso giving significant impact on the analysis. Moreover, heat from vehicles was\ndeemed as the biggest contributor than heat release from buildings at rooftops since\nit is too high to influence air temperature at pedestrian level.\nThe study was only performed for an isolated building geometry and did not\ninvestigate the influence of building materials, building cooling loads generated by\nhuman activity and the existence of urban greenery. Thus, it is necessary to consider\nthose aspects to attain deeper understanding on the UHI occurrence in the future\nworks. Eventually, this study attempts to giving an understanding on how\nmicroclimate analysis can be performed at the early stages of the planning process,\nwhen urban planners could be well informed of the environmental impact to\nconsider the town planning as proposed strategies to mitigate UHI", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Friscarona Hariyanto": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/181327", "BAB 1 Friscarona Hariyanto": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/181328", "BAB 2 Friscarona Hariyanto": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/181329", "BAB 3 Friscarona Hariyanto": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/181330", "BAB 4 Friscarona Hariyanto": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/181331", "BAB 5 Friscarona Hariyanto": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/181332", "BAB 6 Friscarona Hariyanto": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/181333", "BAB 7 Friscarona Hariyanto": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/181334", "DAFTAR Friscarona Hariyanto": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/181335", "2019 TS PP FRISCARONA HARIYANTO_LAMPIRAN.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/181336", "2019 TS PP FRISCARONA HARIYANTO_JURNAL.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184458"}, "Penulis": "Friscarona Hariyanto [25417001]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. RM.
