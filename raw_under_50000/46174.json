{"Nomor": 46174, "Judul": "THE ROLE OF AMYLOGENIC FIBER AGGREGATION ON THE ELASTICITY OF A LIPID MEMBRANE", "Abstrak": "This work presents a systematic study of the swelling behavior\nof a lecithin lamellar phase incorporating different amounts of the short\npeptide sequence diphenylalanine (FF). Small- and wide-angle X-ray\nscattering assays provide relevant information about the structure and\nelasticity of the lamellar stacking. These data show that important changes\noccur at the interface of the lipid membrane dependent not only on the\npeptide content but also on the hydration of the lamellar structure.\nMultilamellar-to-unilamellar transitions, previously observed for an increasing\nnumber of peptides, are now observed to be dependent on the hydration of\nthe lamellar phase. Wide-angle X-ray scattering and electron microscopy\nobservations (TEM) provide experimental evidence of peptide aggregation\ninto long amylogenic fibers. We argue that aggregates that partition in water\nmay become large enough to destabilize the lamellar structure. It is also\nshown that, for a given peptide concentration, the lamellar structure can be\nrendered more flexible or more rigid, by tuning the hydration.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Barbara B.
