Accurate determination of key fracture mechanics parameters is essential for damage\ntolerance design and fatigue crack growth life predictions. The purpose of this paper is to provide\nan efficient and accurate closed-form weight function approach to the calculation of crack surface\ndisplacements for a radial crack emanating from a semi-circular notch in a semi-infinite plate.\nResults are presented for two load conditions: remote applied stress and uniform stress segment\napplied to crack surfaces. Based on a correction of stress intensity factor ratio, highly accurate\nanalytical equations of crack surface displacements under the two load conditions are developed\nby fitting the data obtained with the weight function method. It is demonstrated that the Wu-\nCarlsson closed-form weight functions are very efficient, accurate and easy-to-use for calculating\ncrack surface displacements for arbitrary load conditions. The method will facilitate fatigue crack\nclosure and other fracture mechanics analyses where accurate crack surface displacements are\nrequired.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Dihua Tong [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xueren Wu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "radial crack, semi-circular notch, Dugdale strip-yield model, crack surface displace- ment, weight function method", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 3, June, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Jul 2019"}
