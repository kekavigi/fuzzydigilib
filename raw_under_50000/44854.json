{"Nomor": 44854, "Judul": "A New Method Used For Reservoir Production Performance Analysis", "Abstrak": "Water flooding type-curves, recently receiving increasing attentions, play an essential role in evaluation\nof OOIP and prediction of future production. The study proposed a method modified form Weibull model\nand water flooding type-curves to analyze the reservoir production performance, including predication\nof oil production and water injection rates. The results indicate that the method can estimate and provide\nsolutions for oil production, water injection rate and injection-production ratio with a well accuracy. A\ncase study is conducted to demonstrate the applicability and accuracy of model by field data. The\nmatching results illustrate a good accordance between calculated values and field data", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SHUYONG HU [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yi Deng", "Yongkai Li", "Ran Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Weibull model, Water flooding type-curves, Oil production, Water injection rate, Injection-production ratio", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 5, Issue 1, Pages 30-34 (March  2019), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.02.001", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Nov 2019"}
