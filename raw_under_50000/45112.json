{"Nomor": 45112, "Judul": "General Criterion For Intersection Between Hydraulic Induced Fractures And Pre-Existing Natural Fractures", "Abstrak": "Pre-existing natural fractures and other structurally weak planes are usually well-developed in unconventional\nreservoirs. When such fractures intersect with hydraulic induced fractures, they will redirect and propagate as an\nimportant mechanical principle of volume fracturing by the formation of complex fracture networks. Under the\nshadow effect of natural fractures and other structurally weak planes with hydraulic supported fracture stress,\nhydraulic fractures do not fully propagate in the direction of the maximum horizontal-principal-stress. This\npaper computed the stress intensity factors of hydraulic fracture types I and II by integrating the various interactions, established universally-applicable mechanical principles for the propagation behavior when a hydraulic fracture propagating in an arbitrary direction intersects with a natural fracture at an arbitrary angle, and\ndemonstrated the mechanical principles of the intersection between hydraulic induced fractures and pre-existing\nnatural fractures. This study proved the following conclusions: as the intersection angle between the hydraulic\nfracture and the maximum horizontal-principal-stress increased, the possibility of the hydraulic fracture being\ncaptured by the natural fracture with an identical approaching angle first increased and then decreased; as the\nnet stress increased, the intersection behavior between the hydraulic fracture and the natural fracture transitioned from penetration to capture.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ZHIFENG LUOA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Nanlin Zhanga", "Liqiang Zhaoa", "Fei Liub", "Nianyin Lia"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Hydraulic induced fracture, Pre-existing natural fracture, Intersection criterion, Stress intensity factor, Extended finite element method", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 5, Issue 3, Pages 315-320 (September 2019), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.09.001", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Nov 2019"}
