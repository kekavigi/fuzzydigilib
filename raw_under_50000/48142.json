{"Nomor": 48142, "Judul": "WELL INTEGRITY ANALYSIS FOR CO2 ALTERNATING NANOFLUID HUFF AND PUFF FOR REJUVENATION OF MATURE WELL X IN INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "Indonesia is a country that has many mature fields. Mature fields that have been issued in Indonesia have been applied primary and secondary recovery. To maintain oil production, the mature field must apply the EOR method. In this study, the EOR method used is CO2 injection. However, the full-scale EOR method may not be profitable because the required resources are so large and have to do research that requires quite a long time. Therefore, the method used is the Huff and Puff Method. This method is done by converting one well with injection and production functions. Huff and Puff Techniques: (1) The well is injected with injection fluid, (2) The well is closed for some time to provide time for the working fluid in the reservoir, (3) The well is reopened and the reservoir fluid is produced.\nApplying the Huff and Puff method in mature wells, therefore deals with well integrity problems. Therefore, this study designs an integrity analysis which is divided into two parts, namely the analysis of corrosion and erosion rate of the Huff and Puff method, and evaluation or assessment of production tubing of the Huff and Puff method. Analysis of well integrity will ultimately result in the recommendation of tubular evaluation that leads to good injection of the Huff and Puff method and the potential failure can be minimized.\nIn this study, the Huff and Puff method using nanofluids to reduce the surface tension between oil and rock which will increase the oil production in mature well X. This study shows the results of the maximum corrosion and erosion rate happen when brine and nanofluid injection gives a maximum rate of 15.41 mm/year and a minimum rate of 3.96 mm/year. Assessment of tubing failure results in 2400 psi of burst pressure, collapse pressure of 2233.9 psi, and tension of 41616.64 lbf. All of these results are still following the K-55 production tubing rating. According to the results & discussion, recommendations given so that the Huff and Puff process runs corrosion inhibition either pre-flush or post-flush or coating the tubing with corrosion-resistant materials in parts that give maximum damage rate to reduce costs. With this recommendation, the lifetime of the well can increase for years.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Aldo Leonardo Surbakti [12216073]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
