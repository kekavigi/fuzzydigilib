{"Nomor": 41265, "Judul": "THE EFFECTS OF COD BONE GELATIN ON TRABECULAR MICROSTRUCTURE AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF CANCELLOUS BONE", "Abstrak": "Osteoporosis is a common clinical complication of post-menopausal women and the\nelderly and can significantly complicate the severity of bone fragility. The purpose of this study\nis to investigate how cod bone gelatin administration influences trabecular biomechanical prop-\nerties after ovariectomy. Both biomechanical properties and trabecular microarchitectures were\nevaluated for cancellous bone samples from female ovariectomized rats, which were either sham-\noperated or treated with marine peptide (0.75, 1.5, 3.0, 6.0 g/kg body weight) for 90 days. The\nresults have confirmed that cod bone gelatin treatment is effective in the prevention of mechanical\nproperty loss by preserving bone mass and trabecular architecture.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Renhan Huang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Qiguo Rong, Xiaolong Han, Yong Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "osteoporosis, cod bone gelatin, trabecular microarchitecture, finite element analysis", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 1, February, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Agu 2019"}
