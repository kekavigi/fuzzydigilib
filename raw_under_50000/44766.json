{"Nomor": 44766, "Judul": "A Review Of The Shale Wellbore Stability Mechanism Based On Mechanicalechemical Coupling Theories", "Abstrak": "Wellbore instability in hard brittle shale is a critical topic related to the effective exploitation of\nshale gas resources. This review first introduces the physicalechemical coupling theories applied in\nshale wellbore stability research, including total water absorption method, equivalent pore pressure method, elasticity incremental method of total water potential and non-equilibrium thermodynamic method. Second, the influences of water activity, membrane efficiency, clay content\nand drilling fluid on shale wellbore instability are summarized. Results demonstrate that shale and\ndrilling fluid interactions can be the critical factors affecting shale wellbore stability. The effects of\nthermodynamics and electrochemistry may also be considered in the future, especially the\nmicroscopic reaction of shale and drilling fluid interactions. An example of this reaction is the\nchemical reaction between shale components and drilling fluid.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "QIANGUI ZHANG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wenyu Jia", "Xiangyu Fan", "Yongchang Liang", "Yang Yang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Petroleum engineering, Shale, Wellbore stability, Mechanicalechemical coupling, Instability mechanism", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 2, Pages 91-96 (September  2015),  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.06.005", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "05 Nov 2019"}
