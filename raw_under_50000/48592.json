{"Nomor": 48592, "Judul": "KLASIFIKASI KEPADATAN LALU LINTAS BERDASARKAN KARAKTERISTIK JALAN BERBASIS METODE MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON DAN RANDOM FOREST", "Abstrak": "Traffic management is often operated to solve traffic jam which caused by the vehicle\nvolume and the road capacity. But, currently, the traffic management still rely on a\nsubjective information from specific stakeholder who manages day by day. The\nobservation process is done by first-person view. By this condition, the management\nwill be a subjective model. Besides, the world has envolved day by day and gives us\nchances to apply a good technology for our problems. Because of the opportunity and\nthreats, there are chances to get an objective information by applying machine\nlearning. In this final project, the algorithm that being used is Artificial Neural Network\n\u2013 Multilayer Perceptron and Random Forest. The applied methodology in the final\nproject is Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining which consists of business\nunderstanding, data understanding, data preparation, modelling, and evaluation. In\ndata preparation process, oversampling is being applied to data collection. In\nparameter adjusment and modelling process, grid-search and k-fold cross validation is\nbeing applied to the process. In evaluation process, there are 3 metrics for\nmeasurement. They are consists of recall, precision, and F1-score. The data collection\nwhich being examined in this project is Australia data in 2014-2017. The project shows\nthat Multilayer Perceptron is the best model with 0.997232 for recall score, 0.998974\nfor precision score, and 0.998100 for F1-Score.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Nabila Rahmi Maulida [18216051]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Kusprasapta Mutijarsa, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sistem dan Teknologi Informasi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Teknik Elektro dan Informatika", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "machine learning, traffic, random forest, Artificial Neural Network, Multilayer Perceptron", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Jun 2020"}
