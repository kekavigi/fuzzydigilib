{"Nomor": 45774, "Judul": "FORMULATION AND EVALUATION OF MUCOADHESIVE TABLETS OF NAPROXEN SODIUM USING VARIOUS POLYMERS", "Abstrak": "Mucoadhesive tablets were widely used because they release drug for long time, where the\nfrequency of drug administered was reduced providing convenience for patients. Tablets were\nincorporated with polymeric binders in designing such novel drug delivery system. The aim of this\nstudy was to develop tablet formulations which had mucoadhesive properties with active ingredient\nof naproxen sodium using synthetic polymers such as Carbopol 940, PVP K30, and natural\npolymers such as sodium alginate, gelatin, and starch. The powder blend was mixed and evaluated\nfor powder characteristics such as flowability, bulk density and tapped density. Fifteen tablet\nbatches were formulated using direct compression method. Formulations F13, F14 and F15\nundergone tablet evaluation namely hardness test, friability, weight variation, dissolution test, and\nswelling index determination. Dissolution test was carried out for 5 hours using USP Type 2 paddle\nin 900 mL of 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 and the buffer medium was maintained at 37 \u00b1 0.5 \u00baC\nand the speed of the paddle was set at 50 rpm. The mucoadhesive characteristic tests were carried\nout based on mucoadhesive time, mucoadhesive strength and force of mucoadhesion using rabbit\ngastrointestinal mucosal layer and a modified weighing balance method. Formulations F13, F14,\nand F15 showed good powder characteristic and fulfilled the tablet requirements. The formulations\nF13 and F15 exhibited mucoadhesive properties based on mucoadhesive time, mucoadhesive\nstrength and force of mucoadhesion. F13 showed better mucoadhesive characteristic than F15. The\nmucoadhesion time of F13 was 24.03 minutes, the mucoadhesive strength was 474.71 N and the\nforce of adhesion was 4.65 N. The use of mucoadhesive polymers with appropriate excipients\nproduced good tablet characteristic and mucoadhesive properties.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Sharliny A P Kamalakanan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/196750"}, "Penulis": "Sharliny A P Kamalakanan [10710710]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Jessie Sofia Pamudji, MS", "Dr. Diky Mudhakir, S.Si., M.Si."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sains dan Teknologi Farmasi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Farmasi", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Naproxen sodium, carbopol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, mucoadhesive", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Jan 2020"}
