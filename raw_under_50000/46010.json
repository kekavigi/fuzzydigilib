{"Nomor": 46010, "Judul": "SYNCHRONIZATION TO BIG DATA: NUDGING THE NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS FOR DATA ASSIMILATION OF TURBULENT FLOWS", "Abstrak": "Nudging is an important data assimilation technique where partial field measurements are used to control\nthe evolution of a dynamical system and/or to reconstruct the entire phase-space configuration of the\nsupplied flow. Here, we apply it to the canonical problem of fluid dynamics: three-dimensional\nhomogeneous and isotropic turbulence. By doing numerical experiments we perform a systematic\nassessment of how well the technique reconstructs large- and small-scale features of the flow with\nrespect to the quantity and the quality or type of data supplied to it. The types of data used are (i) field\nvalues on a fixed number of spatial locations (Eulerian nudging), (ii) Fourier coefficients of the fields on a\nfixed range of wave numbers (Fourier nudging), or (iii) field values along a set of moving probes inside the flow (Lagrangian nudging). We present state-of-the-art quantitative measurements of the scale-by-scale transition to synchronization and a detailed discussion of the probability distribution function of the\nreconstruction error, by comparing the nudged field and the truth point by point. Furthermore, we show that for more complex flow configurations, like the case of anisotropic rotating turbulence, the presence of cyclonic and anticyclonic structures leads to unexpectedly better performances of the algorithm.We discuss potential further applications of nudging to a series of applied flow configurations, including the problem of field reconstruction in thermal Rayleigh-B\u00b4enard convection and in magnetohydrodynamics, and to the determination of optimal parametrization for small-scale turbulent modeling. Our study fixes the standard requirements for future applications of nudging to complex turbulent flows.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Patricio Clark Di Leoni [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Andrea Mazzino, and Luca Biferale"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Physics", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW X 10, 011023 (2020), APS", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari \u00a0\n                                     Rita Nurainni, S.I.Pus", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Feb 2020"}
