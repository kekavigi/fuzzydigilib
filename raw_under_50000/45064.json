{"Nomor": 45064, "Judul": "Molecular Dynamics Simulation Of Methane Gas Flow In Nanopores", "Abstrak": "The transport properties of fluids in nanopores are a fundamental scientific issue in the development of tight\nreservoirs such as shale gas. The flow of gas in nanosized pores is affected by a size effect, therefore, the conventional fluid mechanics theory cannot be applied. Based on the molecular dynamics theory, the transport\nprocess of methane in carbon nanopores was studied, including simulation of the arrangement of the wall atoms,\nslip and transitional flow of methane in the supercritical state and application of different driving forces. The\nresearch of this paper revealed that the configuration of the wall carbon atoms, at the microscale, has a greater\ninfluence on the density distribution and velocity distribution of methane molecules in the pores, while the\nchange in the driving force has a greater impact on the slippage of methane at the boundary. Particularly, the\ntheoretical model we proposed can predict the transport properties in carbon nanopores, demonstrating the\nsensitivity of driving force, pore configuration and the state of flow for methane gas transport, which can provide\nthe characteristic parameters for the establishment of the seepage mathematical model.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "JING ZHANGA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Guihong Peia", "Liyin Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Industrial oils, fats, waxes, gases", "Kata Kunci": "Molecular dynamics, Shale gas, Transport property, Carbon nanopore, Numerical simulation", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 5, Issue 3, Pages 252-259 (September 2019), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.12.008", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Nov 2019"}
