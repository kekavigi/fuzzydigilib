{"Nomor": 44849, "Judul": "Sweet-Spot Mapping Through Formation Evaluation And Property Modelling Using Data From The Goldwyer Formation Of The Barbwire Terrace, Canning Basin", "Abstrak": "The Goldwyer Formation of the Canning Basin has been regarded as a highly prospective shale play. This\nstudy assesses the potential prospectivity of this source rock as an unconventional hydrocarbon resource.\nConsidering the sparsity of wells penetrating the Middle Ordovician Goldwyer across the vast underexplored\narea of the Canning Basin, a basin-wide study of the source rock is not warranted. Goldwyer\nassessment of the Barbwire Terrace, a subdivision of the Canning Basin, is carried out instead.\nThis assessment includes the estimation of key shale play properties, such as, total organic carbon,\ntotal porosity, water saturation, and brittleness index. Each property was estimated from available well\ndata by testing multiple estimation methods. TOC values were derived from multiple regressions of\ndifferent well data. A simplified Archie's equation was used to estimate water saturation. Density\nporosity method was primarily used for total porosity estimations. Sonic data along with density were\nutilized to estimate brittleness index.\nEach property was then modelled across the Goldwyer Formation within the terrace. This provided\ngeostatistical estimates on the propagation of such properties. In order to generate sweet spot maps for\nthe Barbwire Terrace, averaged maps of different properties were combined in a weighted manner. This\napproach attempts to simplify the complexity of unconventional resource assessment, which therefore\nhas provided a single product evaluating the prospectivity of the Goldwyer as a hydrocarbon resource.\nResults have shown that TOC and porosity are mostly the deciding factors for the prospectivity of this\nsource rock, given that their values can be too small where the Goldwyer is deemed non-prospective.\nNonetheless, sweet-spot maps show that most prospective zone is the Upper Goldwyer (Goldwyer I),\nfollowed by the upper parts of the Lower Goldwyer (Goldwyer III). More specifically, southern flanks of\nnorth-western and middle regions of the Barbwire Terrace tend to be more prospective. A stricter\napproach where cut-off values were applied for each property showed that sweet-spot maps are only\nprospective in the southern flanks of the middle Barbwire Terrace of Goldwyer I.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MUNTHER ALSHAKHS [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Reza Rezaee"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "Sweet-spot maps, Formation evaluation, Petrophysical modelling", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 5, Issue 1, Pages 13-29 (March  2019), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.06.003", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Nov 2019"}
