{"Nomor": 44831, "Judul": "On The Formation Of Limit Cycle Of The Friction-Induced Stick-Slip Vibration In Oilwell Drillstring", "Abstrak": "In this paper, the stick-slip vibration in oilwell drillstring is studied. The drilling system is modelled\nas a lumped-parameter torsional pendulum and the interaction between the drill bit and the rock is\ntreated as Coulomb friction. Equation of motion of the drill bit is established and the dynamic\nresponses of the drill bit are obtained. A drilling system with the drillstring length 3000 m is\nanalysed, in which the system parameters are selected by reference to the actual drilling situation.\nAfter the slip vibrations in the initial stage, final state of the drill bit is a stable stick-slip vibration of\nwhich the limit cycle is a closed loop. In order to find the stability of the limit cycle corresponds to\nthe periodically stick-slip vibration, different initial conditions for the drill bit are studied. Results\nshow that the drill bit will lead to a periodic motion and the phase trajectories ultimately converge\nto the same limit cycle corresponds to stable stick-slip vibration", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "XIAOHUA ZHU [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Liping Tang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Stick-slip vibration, Friction, Drillstring, Drill bit, Limit cycle", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 1, Pages 63-67 (March  2015),     http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.03.005", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Nov 2019"}
