The temperature sensitivity\nis determined and compared with that of coarse grained material. The results indicate that the flow\nstress of ultrafine grained aluminum displays enhanced sensitivity to temperature. The reduction\nin activation volume is suggested to be the major reason for the enhanced temperature sensitivity\nas grain size is refined into the sub-micrometer regime. Finally, a phenomenological constitutive\nmodel is proposed to describe the post-yield response of ultrafine grained aluminum.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Quanwei Zhan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Tao Suo, Cunxian Wang, Kui Xie,  Zhongbin Tang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "ultrafine grained aluminum, compressive behavior, temperature sensitivity, strain hardening behavior, constitutive relation", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 27, No. 4, August, 2014", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan \u00a0\n                                     Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "16 Jul 2019"}
