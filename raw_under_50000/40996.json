{"Nomor": 40996, "Judul": "Numerical Simulations Of Seepage Flow In Rough Single Rock Fractures", "Abstrak": "To investigate the relationship between the structural characteristics and seepage flow behavior of\nrough single rock fractures, a set of single fracture physical models were produced using the\nWeierstrasseMandelbrot functions to test the seepage flow performance. Six single fractures, with\nvarious surface roughnesses characterized by fractal dimensions, were built using COMSOL multiphysics software. The fluid flow behavior through the rough fractures and the influences of the\nrough surfaces on the fluid flow behavior was then monitored. The numerical simulation indicates\nthat there is a linear relationship between the average flow velocity over the entire flow path and\nthe fractal dimension of the rough surface. It is shown that there is good agreement between the\nnumerical results and the experimental data in terms of the properties a of the fluid flowing\nthrough the rough single rock fractures", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "QINGANG ZHANG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yang Ju", "Wenbo Gong", "Liang Zhang", "Huafei Sun"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Seepage flow, Single fracture, Rough surface, Fractal dimension, Fractured rock", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 3, Pages 200-205 (September  2015), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.09.003", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Jul 2019"}
