{"Nomor": 41563, "Judul": "Design of a generic management system for wireless sensor networks", "Abstrak": "This paper proposes the DISON framework, a generic management system for Wireless\nSensor Networks (WSNs). The first objective of the DISON framework is to allow sensor\nnodes to adapt autonomously to changes in application requirements and network\nresources. The second objective is to provide a framework that enables both the developer\nand the administrator of WSNs to choose what management functions to perform, what\nconditions should trigger sensor nodes\u2019 adaption, and how to adapt in both the development\nand run-time stages. To achieve these objectives, firstly we propose a multilevel\nmanagement mechanism where every sensor node is empowered to participate in the\nmanagement process at different levels according to its resources. Then, we explain how\nsensor nodes can be self adaptive by defining two data models, a context model and a policy\nmodel. We also discuss how context is validated and how it is used to trigger policies.\nWe then present two management functions that can be applied to most applications, the\nmonitoring function and the resource allocating function. We implement DISON in TinyOS\noperating system as an independent component which can interact with user applications\nand other network components through public interfaces. The feasibility of the resource\nallocating function is evaluated on a 26-node indoor testbed. The results of the experiments\nshow that DISON can not only resolve the management problems but also improve\nnetwork performance such as packet delivery rate or energy consumption. Finally, through\nexperiments in another testbed with different number of nodes, we demonstrate the\nscalability of DISON.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Trang Minh Cao  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Boris Bellata, Miquel Oliver"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Network management, Sensor networks, Context aware, Multiservice WSNs, Resource allocation", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect, Ad Hoc Networks 20 (2014) 16\u201335", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Agu 2019"}
