{"Nomor": 45850, "Judul": "Thrust reverser modulationFa tool to command landing ground run", "Abstrak": "Due to inefficiencies and associated cost incurred by taxi-in related delays in a busy airport, a new idea\nhas been proposed to efficiently command and control the landing ground run of medium to heavy\ntransport aircraft equipped with thrust reversers. The idea is based on the modulation of thrust reversers\ninstalled on the aircraft. To demonstrate the efficiency of such a system, the complete equations of motion\nas soon as the main gears touch the ground, up until the aircraft comes to a complete stop have been\ndeveloped. In addition to the thrust reversers, all effective control mechanisms during the landing process,\nsuch as brakes and spoilers have been included in the mathematical model. By proposing a suitable\ndefinition for an optimum landing ground run and its associated cost function different contour plots for\nlanding ground run vs. optimal control commands have been developed for a typical heavy transport. It is\nfurther shown that a modulated thrust reverser could be an effective tool to command and control the\nlanding ground run of an aircraft. The results of simulation program for a typical heavy transport, such as\na B-747-100, show a possibility of 12% decrease in the time associated with taxi-in.r2001 Elsevier Science\nLtd.
