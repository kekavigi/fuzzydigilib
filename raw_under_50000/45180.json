{"Nomor": 45180, "Judul": "Higher-Order Topological Insulator in Twisted Bilayer Graphene", "Abstrak": "Higher-order topological insulators are newly proposed topological phases of matter, whose bulk\ntopology manifests as localized modes at two- or higher-dimensional lower boundaries. In this Letter, we\npropose the twisted bilayer graphenes with large angles as higher-order topological insulators, hosting\ntopological corner charges. At large commensurate angles, the intervalley scattering opens up the bulk gap\nand the corner states occur at half filling. Based on both first-principles calculations and analytic analysis,\nwe show the striking results that the emergence of the corner states do not depend on the choice of the\nspecific angles as long as the underlying symmetries are intact. Our results show that the twisted bilayer\ngraphene can serve as a robust candidate material of a two-dimensional higher-order topological insulator.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Moon Jip Park [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Youngkuk Kim , Gil Young Cho, and SungBin Lee"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 123, 216803 (2019), APS", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Nov 2019"}
