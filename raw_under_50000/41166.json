{"Nomor": 41166, "Judul": "A SIMULATION BASEDON THE COSSERAT CONTINUUM MODEL OF THEVORTEX STRUCTURE IN GRANULARMATERIALS", "Abstrak": "Displacement fluctuation is the difference between the real displacement and the\naffine displacement in deforming granular materials. The discrete elementmethod (DEM) is widely\nused along with experimental approaches to investigate whether the displacement fluctuation\nrepresents the vortex structure. Current research suggests that the vortex structure is caused by\nthe cooperative motion of particle groups on meso-scales, which results in strain localization in\ngranular materials. In this brief article, we investigate the vortex structure using the finite element\nmethod (FEM) based on the Cosserat continuum model. The numerical example focuses on the\nrelationship between the vortex structure and the shear bands under two conditions: (a) uniform\ngranular materials; (b) granular materials with inclusions. When compared with distributions of\nthe effective strain and the vortex structure, we find that the vortex structure coexists with the\nstrain localization and originates from the stiffness cooperation of different locations in granular\nmaterials at the macro level.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Cun Yu  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xihua Chu, Yuanjie Xu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "granular materials, vortex structure, strain localization, Cosserat continuum model", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 2, April, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Jul 2019"}
