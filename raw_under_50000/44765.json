{"Nomor": 44765, "Judul": "A New Design Of Automatic Vertical Drilling Tool", "Abstrak": "In order to effectively improve penetration rates and enhance wellbore quality for vertical wells, a\nnew Automatic Vertical Drilling Tool (AVDT) based on Eccentric Braced Structure (EBS) is designed.\nApplying operating principle of rotary steering drilling, AVDT adds offset gravity block automatic\ninduction inclination mechanism. When hole straightening happens, tools take essentric moment\nto be produced by gravity of offset gravity lock to control the bearing of guide force, so that well\nstraightening is achieved. The normal tool's size of the AVDT is designed as 215.9 mm?other major\ncomponents' sizes are worked out by the result of theoretical analysis, including the offset angle of\nEBS. This paper aims to introduce the structure, operating principle, theoretical analysis and\ndescribe the key components' parameters setting of the AVDT", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "YANFENG MA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hongquan Xia", "Junxiong Fu", "Peng Yang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Automatic vertical drilling tool, Eccentric braced structure, Well deviation control, Well straightening", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 3, Pages 264-268 (September  2015),  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.09.002", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "05 Nov 2019"}
