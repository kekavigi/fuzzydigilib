This approach demonstrates the impact of\nvariable Sand face flow rate on reservoir performance. A new model for P/R deconvolution is used to convert\npressure pulse from variable flow rate to single and constant rate response. The target of this study is fractal\nreservoirs with and without stimulated and unstimulated reservoir volume.\nMulti-linear flow regimes approach is used to describe pressure behavior in the reservoirs while decline flow\nrate behavior is described by newly proposed model in this study. This model depicts, instead of van Everdingen\nmodel, indirectly the declining rate with time by using pressure responses with production time. Decline flow\nrate behavior simulated by linear and bi-linear flow models are also studied and compared with the one obtained\nby the new model. Several analytical models are used in this study by applying P/R convolution and deconvolution technique and solved for constant and variable flow rate considering different reservoir configurations\nand operating conditions. The results are interpreted and analyzed for better understanding pressure behaviors,\nflow regime types, and productivity index trends for continuously changing flow rate especially at early production time. Estimating stimulated reservoir volume\n( ) Vsrv is considered one of the applications of convolved\npressure since it is calculated from pseudo-steady state flow when late time boundary dominated flow regime is\nreached.\nThe outcomes of this study can be summarized as: 1) Introducing new approach for pressure-rate convolution\nand deconvolution technique for multi-stages hydraulically fractured reservoirs by applying new decline flow\nrate model that indirectly simulates variable flow rate with time. 2) Generating analytical models for dimensionless pressure and flow rate for constant and variable flow rate using the concept of P/R convolution and\ndeconvolution. 3) Comparing the result of newly proposed models with the results obtained by applying van\nEverdingen model for decline rate behavior. 4) Studying the applicability of linear and bi-linear flow models in\nconverting variable flow rate pressure response to single and constant flow rate pressure response. 5) Applying\nthe deconvolution technique to simulate pressure response at late production time to estimate stimulated reservoir volume.\nThe most interesting points are: 1) The main difference in wellbore pressure behavior between variable and\nconstant flow rate can be seen at early production time, however intermediate production time could also show\nvery limited changes for the case of variable rate wellbore pressure. 2) A unit slope line flow regime could be\ndeveloped for varied flow rate pressure response at very early production time similar to the wellbore storage\ndominated flow regime. 3) Productivity index calculated by the proposed models for variable flow rate is greater\nthan the index for constant flow rate. 4) The impact of petrophysical properties of porous media and hydraulic\nfracture characteristics on pressure response are similar in the two cases of variable and constant flow rate. 5)\nThe decline rate models for linear and bi-linear flow are not applicable in pressure deconvolution technique.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SALAM AL-RBEAWIA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jalal Farhan Owayed"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Hydraulic engineering", "Kata Kunci": "Convolution and convolution technique, Rate transient analysis, Pressure transient analysis, Fractured reservoirs, Reservoir performance", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 5, Issue 3, Pages 243-251 (September 2019), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.10.001", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Nov 2019"}
