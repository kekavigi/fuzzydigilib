The increasing demand for data management and interoperable applications of geomodelscan be addressed by developing standard-based exchange formats for the representation of not only a single geological object, but also holistic geomodels.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zhangang Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Honggang Qu, Zixing Wub, Xianghong Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Geo3DML, Geological model, Standard, Data exchange", "Sumber": "www.elsevier.com/locate/cageo", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Jan 2020"}
