{"Nomor": 40760, "Judul": "Effect of horizontal curves on urban arterial crashes", "Abstrak": "tThe crash prediction models of the Highway Safety Manual (HSM), 2010 estimate the expected number ofcrashes for different facility types. Models in Part C Chapter 12 of the first edition of the HSM include crashprediction models for divided and undivided urban arterials. Each of the HSM crash prediction modelsfor highway segments is comprised of a \u201cSafety Performance Function,\u201d a function of AADT and segmentlength, plus, a series of \u201cCrash Modification Factors\u201d (CMFs). The SPF estimates the expected number ofcrashes for the site if the site features are of base condition. The effects of the other features of the site, iftheir values are different from base condition, are carried out through use of CMFs. The existing modelsfor urban arterials do not have any CMF for horizontal curvature. The goal of this research is to investigateif the horizontal alignment has any significant effect on crashes on any of these types of facilities and ifso, to develop a CMF for this feature.Washington State cross sectional data from the Highway Safety Information System (HSIS), 2014 wasused in this research. Data from 2007 to 2009 was used to conduct the investigation. The 2010 datawas used to validate the results. As the results showed, the horizontal curvature has significant safetyeffect on two-lane undivided urban arterials with speed limits of 35 mph and higher and using a CMFfor horizontal curvature in the crash prediction model of this type of facility improves the prediction ofcrashes significantly, for both tangent and curve segments.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mohamadreza Banihashemi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Crash modification factors, Horizontal curve, Urban arterial, Crash prediction", "Sumber": "www.elsevier.com/locate/aap", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Jul 2019"}
