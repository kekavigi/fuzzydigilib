{"Nomor": 44430, "Judul": "STELLAR MERGERS AS THE ORIGIN OF MAGNETIC MASSIVE STARS", "Abstrak": "About ten per cent of \u2018massive\u2019 stars (those of more than 1.5 solar masses) have strong, large-scale surface magnetic fields1\u20133. It has been suggested that merging of main-sequence and pre-mainsequence stars could produce such strong fields4,5, and the predicted fraction of merged massive stars is also about ten per cent6,7. The merger hypothesis is further supported by a lack of magnetic stars in\nclose binaries8,9, which is as expected if mergers produce magnetic stars. Here we report three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the coalescence of two massive stars and follow\nthe evolution of the merged product. Strong magnetic fields are produced in the simulations, and the merged star rejuvenates such that it appears younger and bluer than other coeval stars. This can\nexplain the properties of the magnetic \u2018blue straggler\u2019 star ? Sco in the Upper Scorpius association that has an observationally inferred, apparent age of less than five million years, which is less than half the\nage of its birth association10. Such massive blue straggler stars seem likely to be progenitors of magnetars, perhaps giving rise to some of the enigmatic fast radio bursts observed11, and their supernovae may be affected by their strong magnetic fields12.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "FABIAN R.N.
