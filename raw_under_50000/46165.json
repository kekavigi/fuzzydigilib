{"Nomor": 46165, "Judul": "RAPID VISUAL DETECTION OF AMINES BY PYRYLIUM SALTS FOR FOOD SPOILAGE TAGGANT", "Abstrak": "Amines are ubiquitous in biological world, but are toxic and\nharmful in nature. Detection of biogenic amines that are released from spoiled\nseafood, meat, or dairy products is an important task to maintain the quality\nand safety of these packaged foods. To this endeavor, herein we report\npyrylium salts that are capable of sensing various amines by rapid change of\nfluorescence color or intensity. In molecular level, this change of fluorescence\nis rooted to the formation of pyridine or analogous product that have distinct\noptical property. The pyrylium salts are capable of efficiently sensing amine\nvapors or amine solutions both in solid state and in solution state and thus\ndemonstrating a multiphase sensing platform. Utilizing the excellent sensing\nproperty, we have employed our pyrylium compounds as spoilage indicator\nfor food products such as fish, meat or cheese which relies on sensing biogenic\namines released from these spoiled foods and provide optical response.\nProminent change in visible and luminescence color was observed within 4?\n18 h of packaging at room temperature (?33 \u00b0C). Considering the rapid response for biogenic amines, these molecular sensors have great potential to be utilized for food packaging industry, medical diagnostics, or other sensory devices.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Basavaraja D [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dibyendu Dey, Varsha T.
