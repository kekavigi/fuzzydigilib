{"Nomor": 41422, "Judul": "DYNAMIC PULL-IN INSTABILITY OF DOUBLE-SIDEDACTUATEDNANO-TORSIONAL SWITCHES", "Abstrak": "A nonlinear frequency-amplitude relation is developed to investigate the vibrational\namplitude effect on the dynamic pull-in instability of double-sided-actuated nano-torsional\nswitches. The governing equation of a nano-electro-mechanical system pre-deformed by an electric\nfield contains the quintic nonlinear term. The influences of basic parameters on the pull-in\ninstability and natural frequency are investigated using a powerful analytical approach called\nthe homotopy perturbation method. It is demonstrated that two terms in series expansion are\nsufficient to produce an acceptable solution. The numerical results obtained have verified the\nsoundness of the asymptotic procedure. The phase portraits of the double-sided nano-torsionalactuator\nexhibit periodic, homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hamid M .
