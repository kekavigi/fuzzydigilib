{"Nomor": 45183, "Judul": "Analysis and Optimization Of Control Algorithms For Rsstsp For Horizontal Well Drilling", "Abstrak": "Steering control algorithm plays an important role in a rotary steerable system for horizontal well drilling, including the\ndetermination of the well trajectory, vibrations, stability, durability among other variables. This work develops a control algorithm for three static push-the-bit rotary steerable systems (RSSTSP) (TSP is the abbreviation of \u201cthree static push-the-bit\u201d).\nBased on the structure, mechanism, and working process of the RSSTSP, mechanical and mathematical models are proposed\nto determine the required steering force (amplitude and direction) to move the drill bit from a point to another. Additional\nequations are constructed to overcome the non-uniqueness and then compute the optimal forces for the three pads to achieve\nthe required steering force. Moreover, a new control algorithm of RSSTSP is developed, considering the steerability, stability,\ndurability, favorable area, unfavorable area, maximum usable magnitude of steering force. The proposed control algorithm\nis also applied to a new RSSTSP and tested on a GU-693-P102 well for validation. It is found that each pad force changes\nsmoothly, the drilling tool is stable, and the well trajectory is consistent with the design, demonstrating that our proposed\ncontrol algorithm is robust and efective for RSSTSP for horizontal well drilling", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "LI GANG ZHANG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["G.
