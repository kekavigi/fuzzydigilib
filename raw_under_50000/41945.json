{"Nomor": 41945, "Judul": "ENERGY CAPTURE POTENTIAL OF EXISTING WAVE ENERGY CONVERTERS FOR THE INDONESIAN SEAS", "Abstrak": "One of the promising sources with a high energy density is ocean wave energy (OWE). As an archipelago country, Indonesia needs to consider this resource as an alternative energy that is free and renewable. The propagation of the wind from the Indian and Pacific Oceans influence the amplitude and period of the waves in the southwest and northeast of the Indonesian Seas. However, the development of ocean wave technology in this area is yet to be undertaken due to the limitations of the data and high cost.\nThe present study aims to assess the wave energy resources by analyzing the hindcast wave data performed by the Wavewatch III model for over 21 years. Using MATLAB simulations, some areas were discovered to have a great potential for the wave energy generation. It was also used to evaluate selected Wave Energy Converters (WEC) and determine their capability to do the energy capture in the potential site of Indonesian waters.\nThe results of selected sites indicate that the wave energy resources in the Indonesian Seas reached 74.65 kW/m. Five varieties of WEC were analyzed and the result shows the highest power that could be extracted from the Overtopping device was approximately 157 MW in the best potential site selected.\nCidaun was selected as the area for the WEC utilization with energy flux reached to 42.41 kW/m. One of the Heaving Device type was used to assess the extracted energy and to analyze its development in Indonesia with certain limitations; a single float and has two meters diameter. The energy extracted from the designated WEC was approximately reached 119 GWh annually and cost about 25.13 $cent/kWh. The feed in tariff of the OWE is four times lower than the assessed cost, made it hard to be developed in Indonesia.", "Daftar File": {"BAB 2 Beyrra Triasdian": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180585", "COVER Beyrra Triasdian": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180582", "BAB 1 Beyrra Triasdian": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180584", "BAB 3 Beyrra Triasdian": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180586", "BAB 4 Beyrra Triasdian": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180587", "BAB 5 Beyrra Triasdian": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180588", "PUSTAKA Beyrra Triasdian": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180589"}, "Penulis": "Beyrra Triasdian [23115015]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
