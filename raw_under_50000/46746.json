The objective is the development and validation of a\ncomputational model for the low speed booming noise prediction (noise in the area of low\nspeed and high load of the internal combustion engine). For this purpose, the conditions of\ndriving tests were defined and tests were performed by a test vehicle. The same conditions\nwere imposed to the computational model and the results from the simulation were\ncompared to the measured data. For the model accuracy improvement, the root causes were\nidentified and possible solutions were proposed. Some of them were implemented into the\nmodel. \n\nKey words: Toyota Hybrid System, noise and vibration, MBD methodology,\ntoolchain model, validation", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ivo Vodicka [23117705]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Satrio Wicaksono, S.T., M.Eng., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Mesin", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Toyota Hybrid System, noise and vibration, MBD methodology, toolchain model, validation", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "D.
