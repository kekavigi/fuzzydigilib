{"Nomor": 45897, "Judul": "Spin-Momentum-Locking Inhomogeneities as a Source of Bilinear Magnetoresistance in Topological Insulators", "Abstrak": "A new mechanism of bilinear magnetoresistance (BMR) is proposed and studied theoretically within the\nminimal model describing surface electronic states in topological insulators. The BMR appears as a\nconsequence of the second-order response to electric field, and depends linearly on both magnetic field andcurrent (electric field). The mechanism is based on the interplay of current-induced spin polarization and\nscattering processes due to inhomogeneities of spin-momentum locking, that unavoidably appear as a result of structural defects in topological insulators. The proposed mechanism leads to the BMR even if the\nelectronic band structure is isotropic (e.g., absence of hexagonal warping), and is shown to be dominant at\nlower Fermi energies.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "A.
