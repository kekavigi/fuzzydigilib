{"Nomor": 44705, "Judul": "The efect of pressure and composition on Cu?bearing hydroxide perovskite", "Abstrak": "Hydroxide perovskite solid solutions along the CuxZn1?xSn(OH)6 join have been investigated at ambient conditions. Two\ncompositions, Cu0.4Zn0.6Sn(OH)6 (cubic) and CuSn(OH)6 (tetragonal), have also been studied at pressures up to 17 GPa. In\nboth ambient and high-pressure experiments, samples were characterised using powder X-ray difraction. Bulk compositions\nbetween 0?XCu?0.4 are metrically cubic (space group Pn3?), whereas those with XCu=0.9 and 1 produced single-phase\ntetragonal Cu0.9Zn0.1Sn(OH)6 and CuSn(OH)6 (space group P42/n). The products of syntheses with 0.5?XCu?0.8 contain\ncoexisting cubic and tetragonal phases. The cubic ? tetragonal transformation is rationalised in terms of being driven by\nlocal strain associated with the accumulation of Cu-rich domains in the cubic phase. The high-pressure studies of cubic\nCu0.4Zn0.6Sn(OH)6 and tetragonal CuSn(OH)6 phases showed contrasting behaviour. The compression curve of the cubic\nphase is smooth without infexion or discontinuity to 17 GPa. The derived bulk modulus of Cu0.4Zn0.6Sn(OH)6 is K0=75.8(4)\nGPa (K?=4). For CuSn(OH)6, compression data cannot be ftted by a single equation-of-state over the entire pressure range\nto 17 GPa, as there is a clear discontinuity between 7 and 10 GPa that corresponds to an increase in compressibility at higher\npressures. Compression data for CuSn(OH)6 to 7 GPa are: K0=59.7(9) GPa, Ka0=79(2) GPa, and Kc0=38.0(3) GPa (K?=4\nfor all). It is shown that the strong Jahn\u2013Teller distortion associated with the Cu(OH)6 octahedron is primarily responsible\nfor the discontinuous and highly anisotropic compressional behaviour of the unit cell of CuSn(OH)6 hydroxide perovskite.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jens Najorka1  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Annette K.
