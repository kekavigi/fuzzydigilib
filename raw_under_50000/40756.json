{"Nomor": 40756, "Judul": "Traffic crash liability determination: Danger and Dodge model", "Abstrak": "By proposing a systematic set of rules for traffic crash liability determination, this paper attempts to prove\nthe feasibility and practicability of legal liability in handling traffic crashes. Two sequential elements are\nidentified for crash occurrence, i.e., the occurrence of a dangerous situation and failure in dodging the\ndangerous situation. A Danger and Dodge model is subsequently established for liability determination\nin a traffic crash. By investigating the basic mechanism of a crash occurrence, the specific contents of\ncausalties and the effect of the parties\u2019 acts in traffic crashes are specified. Based on the theories of social\nadequancy, the principle of reliance and the duty of care, the study further proposes to use the \u201cperil\u201d\nof a dangerous situation and the \u201cpossibility\u201d of dodging the dangerous situation to appraise the effect\nof the parties\u2019 acts upon a crash occurrence, with the rule of the \u201cpattern deciding effect\u201d. The proposed\napproach would be very helpful to the concreteness of the determination of liability in a traffic crash.\nTwo case studies are presented for demonstration.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Sikui Xu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Helai Huang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Traffic crash, Determination of liability, Danger and dodge, Pattern deciding effect, Rule of determination", "Sumber": "www.elsevier.com/locate/aap", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Jul 2019"}
