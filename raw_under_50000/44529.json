{"Nomor": 44529, "Judul": "A METHODOLOGY TO EVALUATE THE TRANSFORMATION OF TRADITIONAL BALINESE HOUSES AS A CONSEQUENCE OF TOURISM", "Abstrak": "Some traditional houses in Bali have been transformed to tourist facilities. As a cultural\nphenomenon, the transformation involves an interrelated complexity of aspects in the\nhouses. There is a need for a holistic approach to contextualize the complexity of the impact\nof tourism on the transformation. Unfortunately, an instrument to identify the textures of the\ntransformation, as a fundamental phase to explore the complexity, is not yet available. The\nobjective of this study is to develop an inclusive methodology based on criteria as the\nfundamental stage in the multiple holistic methods developed. Using visual documentations\nof 749 traditional houses from four villages, the findings show that the transformation has\nbeen considered in various ways, both as the additive sum of the specific changes, and as a\nhierarchy of cultural traditions and activities. It was a process generally found to begin at the\nfront part of the houses, followed by the backyard and pavilions, and in the final phase at the\nfamily temple. This method was able to systematically assess the physical configuration of\nthe transformed house.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "I D.G.A.
