{"Nomor": 44963, "Judul": "Energy and rf cavity phase symmetry enforcement in multiturn energy recovery linac models", "Abstrak": "In a multipass energy recovery linac (ERL), each cavity must regain all energy expended from beam\nacceleration during beam deceleration, and the beam should achieve specific energy targets during each\nloop that returns it to the linac. For full energy recovery, and for every returning beam to meet loop energy\nrequirements, we must specify and maintain the phase and voltage of cavity fields in addition to selecting\nadequate flight times. These parameters are found with a full scale numerical optimization program. If we\nimpose symmetry in time and energy during acceleration and deceleration, fewer parameters are needed,\nsimplifying the optimization. As an example, we present symmetric models of the Cornell BNL ERL Test\nAccelerator (CBETA) with solutions that satisfy the optimization targets of loop energy and zero cavity\nloading. An identical cavity design and nearly uniform linac layout make CBETA a potential candidate for\nsymmetric operation.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "R.
