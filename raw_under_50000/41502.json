We analyze the characteristics of postseismic deformation of the 2004 earthquake based on GPS networks operated by BIG, and the others named AGNeSS, and SuGAr networks located in northern Sumatra. We use a simple analytical logarithmic and exponential function to evaluate the postseismic deformation parameters of the 2004 earthquake. We find that GPS data in northern Sumatra during time periods of 2005\u20132012 are fit better using the logarithmic function with ?log of 104.2 \u00b1 0.1 than using the exponential function. Our result clearly indicates that other physical mechanisms of postseismic deformation should be taken into account rather than a single physical mechanism of afterslip only.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Bimar Anugrah [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Irwan Meilano, Endra Gunawan, Joni Efendi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Earth sciences", "Kata Kunci": "The 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake,  Continuous GPS data,  Logarithmic and exponential functions", "Sumber": "Earthquake Science  December 2015, Volume 28, Issue 5\u20136, pp 347\u2013352", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Agu 2019"}
