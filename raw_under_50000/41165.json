{"Nomor": 41165, "Judul": "IMPROVED NORMALIZATIONMETHOD FOR DUCTILE FRACTURE TOUGHNESS DETERMINATION BASEDON DIMENSIONLESS LOAD SEPARATION PRINCIPLE", "Abstrak": "This study successfully deals with the inhomogeneous dimension problem of load\nseparation assumption, which is the theoretical basis of the normalization method. According to\nthe dimensionless load separation principle, the normalization method has been improved by introducing\na forcible blunting correction. With the improved normalization method, the J-resistance\ncurves of five different metallic materials of CT and SEB specimens are estimated. The forcible\nblunting correction of initial crack size plays an important role in the J-resistance curve estimation,\nwhich is closely related to the strain hardening level of material. The higher level of strain\nhardening leads to a greater difference in JQ determined by different slopes of the blunting line.\nIf the blunting line coefficient recommended by ASTM E1820-11 is used in the improved normalization\nmethod, it will lead to greater fracture resistance than that processed by the blunting\nline coefficient recommended by ISO 12135-2002. Therefore, the influence of the blunting line on\nthe determination of JQ must be taken into full account in the fracture toughness assessment of\nmetallic materials.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Chen Bao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Lixun Cai, Kaikai Shi, Chen Dan, Yao Yao"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "dimensionless load separation, improved normalization method, dimension inhomogeneous, J-resistance curve, forcible blunting correction", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 2, April, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Jul 2019"}
