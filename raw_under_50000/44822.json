{"Nomor": 44822, "Judul": "Investigation Of Alkalineecrude Oil Reaction", "Abstrak": "One of the mechanisms of alkaline flooding relies on alkaline reaction with organic acids (saponifiable components) in the crude oil to produce an in situ surfactant called soap that lowers\ninterfacial tensions. However, this mechanism is not quantified in the literature. For example, what\nis the fraction of acid components which react with alkaline solution to generate soap? How much\nsoap can be generated?\nIn this paper, this mechanism and related issues are discussed, analyzed or quantified. In\nparticular, the numerical simulation approach is used. The results show that only a fraction of acid\ncomponents can be converted into soap; the amount of generated soap could be low. A minimum\npH (e.g. 9) is needed for the acids to be converted to soap. The literature information on the effect of\namount of acid components (total acid number) on oil recovery is also discussed", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "JAMES J.
