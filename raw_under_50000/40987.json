{"Nomor": 40987, "Judul": "Polymorphism in some birds of Galliformes", "Abstrak": "The phylogenetic and taxonomic status of galliformbirds is difficult to ascertain. This study reviews previous research on molecular techniques and morphological characteristics (e.g., plumage color) of Tragopan, Ithaginis,\nand Perdix to elucidate the polymorphism and taxonomic criteria of some galliform genera. Taxonomic criteria\ninclude genetic andmorphologic characteristics (e.g., body color). Plumage color is associated with sexual selection and environmental factors and, therefore, is an important criterion in bird taxonomy. The results of this study reveal the polymorphism of some galliform birds and the difficulty in ascertaining the taxonomic status of these birds.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Longying Wen  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yiqiang Fu, Bo Dai, Janine Antalffy"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Morphology, Taxonomic criteria, Color", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Jul 2019"}
