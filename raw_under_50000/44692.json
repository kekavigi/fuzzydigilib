{"Nomor": 44692, "Judul": "Human Error Risk Management Methodology for Rail Crack Incidents", "Abstrak": "The paper presents an innovative approach to\nmodelling the causal relationships of human errors in rail\ncrack incidents (RCI) from a managerial perspective.\nA Bayesian belief network is developed to model RCI by\nconsidering the human errors of designers, manufactures,\noperators and maintainers (DMOM) and the causal relationships involved. A set of dependent variables whose\ncombinations express the relevant functions performed by\neach DMOM participant is used to model the causal relationships. A total of 14 RCI on Hong Kong\u2019s mass transit\nrailway (MTR) from 2008 to 2011 are used to illustrate the\napplication of the model. Bayesian inference is used to\nconduct an importance analysis to assess the impact of the\nparticipants\u2019 errors. Sensitivity analysis is then employed\nto gauge the effect the increased probability of occurrence\nof human errors on RCI. Finally, strategies for human error\nidentification and mitigation of RCI are proposed. The\nidentification of ability of maintainer in the case study as\nthe most important factor influencing the probability of\nRCI implies the priority need to strengthen the maintenance management of the MTR system and that improving\nthe inspection ability of the maintainer is likely to be an\neffective strategy for RCI risk mitigation.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zhiru Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Guofeng Su  \u2022 Martin Skitmore  \u2022 Jianguo Chen  \u2022 Albert P.
