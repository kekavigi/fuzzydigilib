{"Nomor": 44885, "Judul": "Application of Lauryl Betaine in Enhanced Oil Recovery: A Comparative Study In Micromodel", "Abstrak": "Micromodel flooding is a cost-effective method to investigate enhanced oil recovery. In this study, we\napply Lauryl Betaine as an amphoteric surfactant to the injected fluids into the micromodel and compare\nthe results with conventional EOR techniques such as water flooding, solvent flooding, and microemulsion flooding. First, we determined the optimal flow rate of injected fluid into the micromodel to\nrepresent fluid flow in the formation. Next, we did water flooding with varying salinities. Next, we did\nsolvent flooding with two different ratios of solvents. Condensate and hexane are the solvents we\napplied. Next, we did surfactant flooding using Lauryl Betaine. Surfactant flooding tests are conducted\nusing different salinity and surfactant concentration (Cs). Finally, we did microemulsion flooding. The\nresults show that surfactant flooding at high salinity using Lauryl Betaine leads to highest oil recovery\namong all tested EOR methods. Besides, the results indicate that addition of Lauryl Betaine to the injected\nbrine leads to higher breakthrough time (BT).", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "HAMIDREZA YARVEICY  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ali Javaheri"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Enhanced oil recovery, Enhanced Oil Recovery", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 5, Issue 2, Pages 123-127 (June  2019), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2017.09.004", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Nov 2019"}
