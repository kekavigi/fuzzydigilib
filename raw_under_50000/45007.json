{"Nomor": 45007, "Judul": "Active control of dispersion within a channel with flow and pulsating walls", "Abstrak": "Channels are fundamental building blocks from biophysics to soft robotics, often used to\ntransport or separate solutes. As solute particles inevitably transverse between streamlines\nalong the channel by molecular diffusion, the effective diffusion of the solute along the\nchannel is enhanced, an effect known as Taylor dispersion. Here we investigate how the\nTaylor dispersion effect can be suppressed or enhanced in different settings. Specifically,\nwe study the impact of flow profile and active or pulsating channel walls on Taylor\ndispersion. We derive closed analytic expressions for the effective dispersion equation in\nall considered scenarios providing hands-on effective dispersion parameters for a multitude\nof applications. In particular, we find that active channel walls may lead to three regimes\nof dispersion: either dispersion decrease by entropic slow down at small P\u00e9clet number, or\nby dispersion increase at large P\u00e9clet number dominated either by shuttle dispersion, or by\nTaylor dispersion. This improves our understanding of solute transport, e.g., in biological\nactive systems such as blood flow, and opens a number of possibilities to control solute\ntransport in artificial systems such as soft robotics.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Sophie Marbach [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Karen Alim"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS 4, 114202 (2019), APS", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Nov 2019"}
