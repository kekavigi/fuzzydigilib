{"Nomor": 45226, "Judul": "Quality improvement of semi-wet terasi by monitoring the microorganism composition during controlled fermentation", "Abstrak": "Terasi is a traditional fermented shrimp paste used in Indonesian dish as condiments. Due to\nits affordability, the paste is widely consumed among the general population, and thus has a\ngreat impact in Indonesia. Currently, small-scale or home industry is common for terasi\nproduction, and natural fermentation process is the traditional method. Fermentation process\nis considered finish when desired aromatic odors are obtained. But this makes the\nfermentation process subjective, because the decision is solely dependent on the producer.\nAdditionally, natural fermentation poses a higher risk for contamination of microbial\npathogens. As a result, the food safety and food taste quality of the final product varies greatly\nfrom region to region. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the quality of terasi by means of\ncontrolled fermentation. Quality improvement can yield safer products, and can change the\nterasi production process from small-scale to large-scale. Hence, the objective of the research\nis to improve the quality of terasi by determining the most optimal fermentation starter\nculture. Optimal fermentation conditions were determined by analyzing the effect of the\nvarious starter inoculum on the inner microbial community, and results indicated that mixed\nculture of Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Bacillus subtilis, and Lactobacillus murinus with\nratio of 2:1:2 was the most effective for suppressing the growth of unwanted microorganisms.\nThe difference in the microbial composition also led to a different metabolite profile.\nCompared to naturally fermented terasi, terasi inoculated with the optimized ratio broke\ndown polymers, such as protein, into its monomers during earlier stage of fermentation.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Arisa Sato": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/190098"}, "Penulis": "Arisa Sato [21118701]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Dea Indriani Astuti, S.Si.", "Prof. Eiichiro Fukusaki, Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Bioteknologi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Ilmu dan Teknologi Hayati", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "quality improvement, terasi, Indonesian shrimp paste, controlled fermentation", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti \u00a0\n                                     Alice Diniarti", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Nov 2019"}
