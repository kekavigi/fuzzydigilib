By the introduction of a dimensionless figure, it can be\nused for comparison irrespective of the very dissimilar definitions. The entity e; well known from the physics\nof flight, the glide numberFi.e. the inverse of the L=D-ratio in Anglo-American literatureFproves to be a\nconvenient starting point.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "H.A.
