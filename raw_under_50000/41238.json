{"Nomor": 41238, "Judul": "CRACKTIP PLASTICITY OF A THERMALLY LOADED PENNY-SHAPED CRACK IN AN INFINITE SPACE OF 1DQC", "Abstrak": "The present work is concerned with a penny-shaped Dugdale crack embedded in\nan infinite space of one-dimensional (1D) hexagonal quasicrystals and subjected to two identical\naxisymmetric temperature loadings on the upper and lower crack surfaces. Applying Dugdale\nhypothesis to thermo-elastic results, the extent of the plastic zone at the crack tip is determined.\nThe normal stress outside the plastic zone and crack surface displacement are derived in terms of\nspecial functions. For a uniform loading case, the corresponding results are presented by simpli-\nfying the preceding results. Numerical calculations are carried out to show the influence of some\nparameters.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xiangyu Li [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Peidng Li, Guozheng Kang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "penny-shaped Dugdale crack, plastic zone, 1D hexagonal quasicrystals, thermal loadings", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 5, October, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan \u00a0\n                                     Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Agu 2019"}
