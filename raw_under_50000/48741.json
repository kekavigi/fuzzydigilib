SEED EXTRACT ON SEVERAL MICROORGANISMS", "Abstrak": "Objective: Purpose of this review is to explore the antimicrobial activity of Moringa oleifera leaves\nextract and Trigonella foenum-graecum L. seed extract against several microorganisms. Methods: A\nnarrative review of all the relevant studies. Results: The presence of diverse phytochemical compound\nin the leaves of Moringa oleifera and in the seeds of T. foenum-graecum has contribute to many\nbiological activities, especially in the infectious disease. The phenolic compounds presence in the\nleaves of M. oleifera worked in a way by protecting muscle against the internal protease and finally\ninhibits protein breakdown and amine production which resulted in the microbial inhibition. Fatty\nacids containing short and long carbon chains exhibited antimicrobial activities against Gram-negative\nand Gram-positive bacteria. Flavonoids contained in the M. oleifera extract have been stated to\npossess anti-biofilm activities. It caused disruption of bacterial attachment on the surface as this step\nis critical for bacteria to initiate a biofilm formation. M. oleifera leaves in ethanol extraction had\nstronger antimicrobial activity mainly on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and\nEscherichia coli microorganisms. The presence of flavonoid in T. foenum graecum seed occur as a C3\u2013\nC6 unit linked to a phenolic ring that is also hydroxylated. The flavonoid compounds are such as\nnaringenin, quercetin and tricin 7-O-b-D-glucopyranoside, vitexin and tricin. These compounds are\nknown to be synthesized in plants as a defense mechanism against microorganisms thus, their\nantimicrobial effect is of no surprise. Their antimicrobial properties are probably because they form\ncomplexes with both extracellular and soluble proteins, as well as bacterial cell wall. Polyphenols\n(kaempferol, quercetin gylcosides and apigenin) had mechanisms included inhibiting enzymes. It was\nsuggested that this inhibition takes place through reactions with sulfhydryl groups on the proteins.\nMethanolic extracts had a broad range of antibacterial effects mainly on Pseudomonas aeruginosa\nand Escherichia coli. Conclusion: The review demonstrated that M. oleifera leaves and T. foenum\ngraceum L. seeds is considered as a promising medicinal plant for the development of an antibacterial\nagent in future drug development.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Indradevi A/P Kanapa": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/208592"}, "Penulis": "Indradevi A/P Kanapa [11617761]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Marlia Singgih, Ph.D.", "Prof Dr. Irda Fidrianny"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Farmasi Klinik dan Komunitas", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Farmasi", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "antimicrobial activity, phytochemical compounds, infectious disease, antibacterial agent", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Jul 2020"}
