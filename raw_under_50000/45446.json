{"Nomor": 45446, "Judul": "COMMUNITY CAPACITY EVALUATION FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CAPABILITY APPROACH Case Study: Rural Infrastructure Project, Pandeglang Regency, Indonesia", "Abstrak": "The shift of development paradigm from top down to bottom up approach since 1950?s, has\ngenerated the approach in development to give more space for citizen participation. Many\ngrants and funding have spread to developing countries either in Asia or in Africa, for financing\nthe project using community-based approach as the mainstream. Indonesia is one of developing\ncountries, which accepts the grants, implements the project using community-based approach to\nimprove infrastructure problem especially in rural area. Unfortunately, the evaluation\nperspective of such project focused only on indicator of performance (such as, physical output,\nquantifiable parameters). Other important indicators, such as community?s quality of life,\nwellbeing, and the impact of development on freedom and social justice are not well\naccommodated. This research is aimed to offer a new perspective on the evaluation of\ncommunity based infrastructure project from the perspective of capability approach. Combining\nit with the concept of Institutional Capacity building is the main idea of the establishment of\nevaluation framework. To test the evaluation framework, two case studies have selected in\nPandeglang regency, especially, in villages that conducted road pavement and irrigation\nimprovement project. Qualitative descriptive analysis has used to explain the phenomenon that\noccurred, as the result from the evaluation framework. The result of evaluation showed that\nthere are important points that were not considered before. Cultural dilutions, elite practice,\nlack of attention in maintenance process, and uneven distribution of benefit are the effect of\ncommunity based infrastructure project that has implemented. General implication resulted from\nthis research might change the approach of evaluation for infrastructure project which has used\nthe community base?s mainstream. In addition, incorporating capability approach with capacity\nwould change the planning paradigm to more concerned with increasing choice that is aimed for\ndecreasing gap rather than focusing on growth area oriented and productivity.", "Daftar File": {"BAB 1 Ryan Hidayat": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/192830"}, "Penulis": "Ryan Hidayat [25410021]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Johan Woltjer", "Tubagus Furqon Sofhani, Ir., MA, Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Perencanaan Wilayah dan Kota", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Arsitektur, Perencanaan dan Pengembangan Kebijakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Community, Capability approach, Community based project", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yoninur Almira", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Des 2019"}
