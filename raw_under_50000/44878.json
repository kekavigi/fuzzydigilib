{"Nomor": 44878, "Judul": "Study On Mechanical Behaviors Of Double Shoulder Drill Pipe Joint Thread", "Abstrak": "Double shoulder drill pipe joint (DSJ) is a novel thread structure which appears in recent years. Its\nstrength reduced efficiently while the structure design is not appropriately, for the DSJ\u2019s mechanical\nbehaviors weren\u2019t well studied. In this paper a 3D whole structure finite element model of DSJ was\nestablished based on the Principle of Virtual Work, and validated the model\u2019s computing results by\nexperimental results. The authors analyzed the stress and strain distribution with the 3D whole structure\nfinite element model\u2019s computing results under torque moment, compression force, tension load, and\nbend moment. And then acquired the DSJ\u2019s mechanical behaviors under each load. The research works of\nthis paper refer accordance to recognize and design the DSJ", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "LIANGLIANG DONG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiaohua Zhu", "Desheng Yang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Double shoulder, Drill pipe joint, Thread, Mechanical behavior", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 5, Issue 1, Pages 102-112 (March  2019), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.01.004", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Nov 2019"}
