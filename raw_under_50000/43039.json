{"Nomor": 43039, "Judul": "Experimental Control of Dielectric Loss Behavior of Polyvinyl Chloride Nanocomposites under Thermal Conditions", "Abstrak": "Dielectric loss quantifies the dielectric materials\ninherent dissipation of electric energy in electric power systems.\nThis paper focuses on controlling in the dielectric loss behavior of\nthe Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC); it has been widely used as\ninsulators in electrical power systems and power devices.\nNanocomposites specimens of polyvinyl chloride have been\nfabricated with variant concentrations of nanoparticles\n(Clay, SiO2, ZnO, and TiO2). The dielectric loss and electric\nproperties of pure and nanocomposites specimens for polyvinyl\nchloride has been measured at different frequencies (10-2Hz-\n103Hz) and temperatures (20\u00b0C-80\u00b0C). The dielectric loss of\npolyvinyl chloride nanocomposites has been minimized and\ncontrolled using certain types and concentrations of\nnanoparticles.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ahmed Thabet Mohamed [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Dielectric loss, energy dissipation, polymers, nanocomposites, nanoparticles.", "Sumber": "2017 Nineteenth International Middle East Power Systems Conference (MEPCON), Menoufia University, Egypt, 19-21 December 2017", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Sep 2019"}
