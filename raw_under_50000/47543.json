{"Nomor": 47543, "Judul": "SYNTHESIS AND INVESTIGATION OF MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF SINGLE CRYSTAL NACRO2", "Abstrak": "Magnetically frustrated compounds are promising for the emergence of various\nexotic magnetic states. They can demonstrate spin-glass behavior, generate a variety\nof spin spirals or even host magnetic skyrmions. Geometrically, magnetic frustration\nis a situation where most of the magnetic sites in a lattice are subject to competing or\ncontradictory exchange interactions, which usually arises from the geometry or\ntopology of the lattice. One such compound of interest is NaCrO2. Polycrystalline\nNaCrO2 is reported to be a strongly frustrated two-dimensional triangular lattice\nantiferromagnet. However, this compound has only been studied for its bulk.\nMoreover, the method to grow the single crystal of this compound has not been wellestablished\nyet. Here, we report on several attempts to grow single crystals of\nNaCrO2 using flux method with various fluxes such as NaCl, PbO \u2013 B2O3, and B2O3.\nThe structural properties of the obtained crystals are then characterized using X-Ray\nDiffraction (XRD), single-crystal XRD, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), dan\nEnergy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS). The magnetic properties of the\ncrystals are characterized using Magnetic Properties Measurement System (MPMS)\nand then compared with the magnetic properties of previously investigated\npolycrystalline NaCrO2.\nAfter the solid-state synthesis, dark-green NaCrO2 powder was obtained. The powder\nwas then analyzed using powder XRD and the Rietveld refinement results showed that\nthe composition of NaCrO2 and Na2CrO4 in the sample is 46:4. This is possibly\ncaused by oxidation of NaCrO2 into Na2CrO4 during sample preparation since it can\nbe easily oxidized when exposed to open air. Na2CrO4 is not really interesting to be\ninvestigated since it is a non-magnetic compound. The obtained NaCrO2 powder was\nthen recrystallized using the NaCl flux. The obtained crystals have a dark green color\nsurrounded by transparent crystals of NaCl flux. The crystals grow preferentially on\nthe wall of the quartz tube and it is difficult to separate the crystals from the quartz\ntube. After the washing process, the crystals are still dark green in color, but they are\nclosely attached to each other and cannot be further investigated as a single crystal.\nThen, two different results were observed from single crystal synthesis using B2O3\nflux, black part at the top and dark-green part at the bottom. Powder and single\ncrystal XRD results of the black part confirms that it is mostly consisted of Cr2O3 and\na small amount of NaCrO2. After washed with distilled water, the obtained crystals\nhad a flat structure and dark-green color when observed under an optical\nmicroscope. Meanwhile, the bottom part consists of Cr2O3 and Na2CrO4 as confirmed\nby powder and single crystal XRD results. Some of the NaCrO2 compounds may be\noxidized during sample preparation. The dark-green part became yellow when ground in open air due to changes in oxidation state from Cr3+ into Cr6+.\nSeveral methods have been done in order to grow a single crystal of NaCrO2 and the\nmost suitable method to grow crystal with nice shape is using PbO \u2013 B2O3 flux with\nthe actual crystal composition of Na0.86CrO2. The issue faced during the washing\nprocess with HNO3 or/and distilled water is the deintercalation of Na+ ions on the\nsurface of the crystal which is affected by the thickness of the crystal. In order to\nprevent the deintercalation process, a thicker crystal is needed that can be grown\nusing a bigger amount of flux. A bigger amount of flux makes it easier to attain\nsupersaturation and to form the nuclei of the crystalline phase. However, the\nmagnetic properties of the Na0.86CrO2 crystal is different from bulk NaCrO2 and\ncannot be fitted using Curie-Weiss fit but still have transition around 46 K that can be\nattributed to the N\u00e9el temperature of NaCrO2. The magnetic susceptibility\nmeasurement for both of samples grown using PbO \u2013 B2O3 flux shows that the spin\nordering is maintained above the room temperature different from that of bulk\nNaCrO2 that the antiferromagnetic ordering vanishes after 46 K. On the other hand,\nthe magnetic field dependence of magnetization curve shows increasing\nmagnetization with increasing applied magnetic field for both samples similar to that\nof bulk NaCrO2.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Rahma Dhani Prasetiyawati": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/207032"}, "Penulis": "Rahma Dhani Prasetiyawati [20218009]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Yudi Darma, S.Si., M.Si."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Physics", "Kata Kunci": "NaCrO2.
