{"Nomor": 47865, "Judul": "RESEARCH ON STRESS RELIEF CONE DEPOSIT BASED ON DIELECTROPHORESIS PHENOMENON IN PREFABRICATED XLPE CABLE TERMINATION", "Abstrak": "Stress relief cone is used in prefabricated XLPE cable termination. Some cases\nhave been reported that white deposit has generated inside due to long-term\noperation and lead to a dielectric breakdown, but the process has not been\nelucidated yet. This research focused on presenting a study of the white deposit\naggregation state based on dielectrophoresis phenomenon. Simulation of the actual\nstress relief cone and permittivity measurement of the white deposit were conducted\nto calculate dielectrophoresis force and velocity. Next, an electrode which imitated\nthe actual condition at the interfaces was made to reproduce the aggregation state\nand observe partial discharges characteristics. As an artificial deposit, the mixing\nmaterial between barium titanate and silicone oil was used. As a result, the white\ndeposit was an insulation material. The dielectrophoresis force and velocity that\nworked at the hundreds nanometer size of the white deposit were at atto.Newton\nand piko.meter/seconds. The poor interface smoothness made the deposit stop\nmoving. The partial discharges repetition rate during the dielectrophoresis\nphenomenon was very low, and positive partial discharge dominantly occurred at\nthe peak of the positive cycle. However, partial discharges activity was decreasing\nover time. The higher the viscosity, the slower the deposit movement and the fewer\nthe partial discharges activities", "Daftar File": {"Abstract": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/207409", "Tesis": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/209701"}, "Penulis": "Primadika Wiweko Banyuaji [23218008]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
