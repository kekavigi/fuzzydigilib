{"Nomor": 41013, "Judul": "Resistance characteristics of Cedrus deodara and Sabina chinensis to heavy metal accumulation under different atmospheric conditions", "Abstrak": "Cedrus deodara and Sabina chinensis are widely planted in North China. The needles of C. deodara and S. chinensis were sampled in the urban, suburban, and rural districts of Tianjin where the atmospheric conditions are significantly different according to the environmental monitoring results. The Cu,Mn, Zn, and Pb concentrations in the samples were examined via ICP. The resistance indexes, and the malonic aldehyde (MDA), soluble sugar, and free proline levels were also determined....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ruirui Zhao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Cong Shi, Meili Zhou, Guoping Chen, Zhangying Gao, Fuchen Shi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Cedrus deodara, Sabina chinensis, Heavy metals, Accumulation, Resistance", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Jul 2019"}
