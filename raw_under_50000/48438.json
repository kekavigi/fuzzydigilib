{"Nomor": 48438, "Judul": "CATALYTIC GASIFICATION OF COAL FOR HYDROGEN PRODUCTION", "Abstrak": "Gasification is considered as an alternative method coal utilization to produce hydrogen\nas an energy carrier. However, it also produces greenhouse gases that harm the\nenvironment. Thus, biomass is added to coal in a co-gasification process in order to\nachieve high content of hydrogen but low greenhouse gases due to their alkali and alkaline\nearth metals (AAEM) content. However, with the use of biomass, tar production is high\ndue to the high volatile matter contained in biomass. Catalytic gasification with CaO\noptimizes hydrogen in syngas production with a low concentration of tar by absorbing\nCO2 and cracking tar.\nThis research uses lignite coal as gasification feedstock, clamshell as the catalyst, and\nseaweed as co-feedstock which has self-catalytic activity due to its high content of\nAAEM. The coals were prepared by removing minerals that inhibit gasification\nperformance with demineralization using HF. While the clamshell was calcined in a\nfurnace at 900oC. The gasification process lasted for 50 minutes. Syngas produced was\nanalyzed using gas chromatography (GC) for its composition and char produced was\nanalyzed by comparing the yield. The effect of seaweed addition to demineralized and\nraw coal gasification were observed respectively, and the effect of CaO catalyst to\ndemineralized coal gasification was also discerned.\nAAEM presence in seaweed is proved to be promoting hydrogen production in\ndemineralized coal-seaweed variations by 2.2 times than raw coal-seaweed gasification\nresults and 10.7 times more hydrogen than demineralized coal gasification, but it showed\na negative synergy effect in raw coal-seaweed variations. Silica content in coal had a great\nimpact towards raw coal-seaweed gasification performance with hydrogen production of\n0.62 of the coal gasification results. While CaO presence in calcined clamshells gave\nbetter gasification performance in producing hydrogen by 3.8 times compared to AAEM\nin demineralized coal-seaweed variations.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Reyhan Fitri Ananda [13016215]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
