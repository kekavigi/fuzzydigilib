{"Nomor": 40758, "Judul": "Program design for incentivizing ignition interlock installation foralcohol-impaired drivers: The Ontario approach", "Abstrak": "Drinking and driving is a major risk factor for traffic injuries. Although ignition interlocksreduce drinking and driving while installed, several issues undermine their implementation includingdelayed eligibility for installation, low installation once eligible, and a return to previous risk lev-els after de-installation. The Canadian province of Ontario introduced a \u201cReduced Suspension withIgnition Interlock Conduct Review\u201d Program, significantly changing pre-existing interlock policy. TheProgram incentivizes interlock installation and an \u201cearly\u201d guilty plea. It also attempts to reduce long-term recidivism through behavioural feedback and compliance-based removal. This evaluation is thefirst in assessing Program impact.Methods: Ontario drivers with a first time alcohol-impaired driving conviction between July 1, 2005 andNovember 25, 2014 comprised the study cohort. Longitudinal analyses, using interrupted time seriesand Cox regression, were conducted in which exposure was the Program and the outcomes were igni-tion interlock installation (N = 30,200), pre-trial elapsed time (N = 30,200), and post-interlock recidivism(N = 9326).Results: After Program implementation, installation rates increased by 54% and pre-trial elapsed timedecreased by 146 days. Results suggest no effect on post-interlock recidivism.Conclusions: Through an incentive-based design, this Program was effective at addressing two commonlycited barriers to interlock implementation- delayed eligibility for installation and low installation onceeligible. Results reveal that installation rates are responsive not only to incentivization but also to otherexternal factors, thus presenting an opportunity for policy makers to find unique ways to influenceinterlock uptake, and thereby, to extend their deterrent effects to a larger subset of the population.This study is one of the few that do not rely on proxy measures of installation rate.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Tracey Ma [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Patrick A.
