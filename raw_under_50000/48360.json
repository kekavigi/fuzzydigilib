{"Nomor": 48360, "Judul": "APPLICATION OF HIGH VISCOSITY FRICTION REDUCERS IN SHALE GAS RESERVOIRS", "Abstrak": "Well stimulations methods through the conjunction of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal wells have enhanced hydrocarbon production in unconventional reservoirs making shale gas production technically and economically possible. The primary function of a fracturing treatment is to increase reservoir contact area by inducing long fracture half-length and higher fractured propped area with of greater fluid volume injection and better transportation of proppant. The success of a fracture treatment depends greatly on selecting a suitable fracturing fluid that has capability to create long fracture half-length and carry the proppant particles deep enough into the fractures. In oil and gas industry High viscosity friction reducers (HVFRs) have recently been successfully applied across all leading shale plays in North America including Bakken, Permian, and Eagle Ford. This study is aimed at examining the influence of application of HVFRs on effective fracture half-length compared to a traditional linear gel. The results of the study were examined to how HVFRs can be a fracture fluid system in shale reservoirs. The results show that using produced water with HVFRs can lead to improved proppant transport and thus higher effective fracture-half-length compared to conventional Linear gel fluids. Compared to the traditional hydraulic fracturing fluids, the study shows the many potential advantages that HVFR fluids offers including greater proppant transport ability, larger fractured propped area, chemical cost reduction and the ability to reduce operation equipment on site. Reusing produced water can be an intelligent decision to lessen environmental footprint and decrease operational expenses. The conclusions from this research can be applied to other unconventional shale plays, such as Eagle Ford and Permian Basin for optimization ideas.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Waseem Chaudhry": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/208099", "DAFTAR Waseem Chaudhry": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/238593"}, "Penulis": "Waseem Chaudhry [22218702]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
