{"Nomor": 44776, "Judul": "The Residual Oil Distribution Regularity Of Low Permeability Oilfield", "Abstrak": "Study on the residual oil distribution regularity is the important thing during the middle and later\nstage of the oilfield. With understanding and development of oilfield, the research methods of\nremaining oil are varied. Well block A is a low permeability oilfield and complex relationship between injection wells and production wells. The well pattern has low control of sand body. Based on\nthe characteristics and the geological and dynamic data, technology of integrated 3-D geological\nmodeling with reservoir numerical simulation is ensured to study the residual oil. Finally, deposition facies and flowing units are studied to analyze the residual oil distribution regularity. As a\nresult, the types of residual oil were confirmed and the basis for the following development\nadjustment of the well block is provided", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "HUAN ZHAO [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hongjun Yin"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Residual oil, Low permeability oilfield, 3-D geological modeling, Reservoir numerical simulation", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 2, Pages 112-117 (September  2015),  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.06.006", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "05 Nov 2019"}
