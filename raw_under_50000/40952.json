{"Nomor": 40952, "Judul": "The effects of erosion on the microbial populations and enzyme activity in black soil of northeastern China", "Abstrak": "Soil erosion may deteriorate soil microbial ecosystems, and assessing the impacts of soil erosion on soil\nmicro-biological properties is important for eroded-soil restoration. Based on the simulated erosion plots\nwith treatments of eight erosion depths (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 cm) and two sub-treatments of\nno fertilizer and chemical fertilizer situated in black soil region, northeast China, soil samples of the 0\u201320\ncm layer in each plots were collected and several key soil biological parameters were determined. The\nresults indicated that the values of all the variables of soil micro-biological properties had a linearly decreasing\ntrend with increasing erosion depths.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Shuai Hou [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mingxiu Xin, LeiWang, Han Jiang, Nan Li, ZhiqiangWang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Soil erosion, Microbial biomass C, Microbial biomass N, Microbial population, Soil enzyme activity", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Jul 2019"}
