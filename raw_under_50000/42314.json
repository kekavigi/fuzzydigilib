{"Nomor": 42314, "Judul": "Sub-threshold level converter with internal supply feedback for multi-voltage applications", "Abstrak": "A new sub-threshold level shifter for ultra-low voltage digital systems is presented in this study. The selfcontrolled supply feedback loop is quintessential for this circuit. Measured results from a test chip show that it is capable of realising a voltage conversion from a voltage as low as 0.1\u20131.2 V reliably, while maintaining an operational frequency of 25.2 kHz, when implemented in a 65-nm process technology. In addition, it also has ample process variation tolerance and low static power consumption. To support multi-voltage digital systems, the proposed level converter can up-convert an input at any voltage with this range to normal voltage domains.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Liang Wen  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Haibo Wen, Xiaoyang Zeng"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "IET Circuits, Devices & Systems", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Sep 2019"}
