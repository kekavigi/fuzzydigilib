{"Nomor": 41099, "Judul": "Technical And Economic Feasibility Study Of Flue Gas Injection In An Iranian Oil Field", "Abstrak": "Nowadays, the non-hydrocarbon gases are the main sources for gas injection projects in different\ncountries. The main advantages of the flue gas injection are low cost, readily available sources\n(which consists mainly of N2 and CO2) and low compressibility in comparison with other gases like\nCO2 or CH4 (for a given volume at the same conditions). In addition, it occupies more space in the\nreservoir and it is an appropriate way for CO2 sequestering and consequently reducing greenhouse\ngases. In the aforementioned method, N2 and/or CO2 is injected into the oil reservoir for miscible\nand/or immiscible displacement of remaining oil.\nMoreover, a key parameter in the designing of a gas injection project is the minimum miscibility\npressure (MMP) which is commonly calculated by running simulation case or implementing conventional correlations. From technical viewpoints, the lower MMP values are more flavor for\nmiscible gas injection process due to lower injection pressure and consequently lower maintenance\nand lower injection costs.\nThe main aim of this research is to investigate various gas injection methods (N2, CO2, produced\nreservoir gas, and flue gas) in one of the northern Persian gulf oil fields by a numerical simulation\nmethod. Moreover, for each scenario of gas injection technical and economical considerations are\ntook into account. Finally, an economic analysis is implemented to compare the net present value\n(NPV) of the different gas injection scenarios in the aforementioned oil field", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MOHAMMAD ALI AHMADI  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mahdi zeinali Hasanvand", "Sara Shokrolahzadeh"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Enhanced oil recovery, Flue gas injection, CO2 sequestration, Economic evaluation, Reservoir simulation", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 3, Pages 217-222 (September  2015), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.07.010", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Jul 2019"}
