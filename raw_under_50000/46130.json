{"Nomor": 46130, "Judul": "19F MAGNETIC RESONANCE ACTIVITY-BASED SENSING USING PARAMAGNETIC METALS", "Abstrak": "Fluorine magnetic resonance imaging (19F\nMRI) is a promising bioimaging technique due to the\nfavorable magnetic resonance properties of the 19F nucleus\nand the lack of detectable biological background signal. A\nrange of imaging agents have been developed for this imaging\nmodality including small molecule perfluorocarbons, fluorinerich\nmacromolecules and nanoparticles, and paramagnetic\nmetal-containing agents. Incorporation of paramagnetic metals\ninto fluorinated agents provides a unique opportunity to\nmanipulate relaxation and chemical shift properties of 19F\nnuclei. Paramagnetic centers will enhance relaxation rates of\nnearby 19F nuclei through paramagnetic relaxation enhancement\n(PRE). Further, metals with anisotropic unpaired electrons can induce changes in 19F chemical shift through pseudocontact shift (PCS) effects. PRE and PCS are dependent on the nature of the metal center itself, the molecular scaffold surrounding it, and the position of the 19F nucleus relative to the metal center.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Da Xie [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Meng Yu, Rahul T.
