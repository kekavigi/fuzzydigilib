{"Nomor": 45266, "Judul": "Integrated Reservoir Characterization of the Paleocene Farewell Formation, Taranaki Basin, New Zealand, Using Petrophysical And Petrographical Analyses", "Abstrak": "A reservoir characterization study, using petrophysical and petrographic analyses, has been made on the Paleocene Farewell\nFormation in the Taranaki Basin, New Zealand, based on fve selected wells. Farewell Formation is largely a sandstone formation belonging to the Kapuni Group. The integrated study has shown that Farewell Formation is a good promising reservoir\nwith average efective porosity of 17.7% and permeability of 415 mD. The petrographic study indicates the occurrence of\nabundant intergranular and secondary pores. It also proved that the Farewell Formation has been afected by several diagenetic\nfeatures. Compaction, cementation and clay mineral authigenesis are the most common. Quartz and feldspar overgrowths\nhave been recorded in many samples, and secondary porosity due to dissolution is also observed. In general, good reservoir\nquality features are dominant in the Farewell Formation and diagenesis has little efect on the reservoir quality. These fndings are supported by well log interpretation results, which confrm good sand and net pay zones are available with very\nlow average water saturation (24.9%).", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "NURHAZWANA JUMAT  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mohamed Ragab Shalaby", "Md.
