{"Nomor": 48112, "Judul": "EFFECT OF ADJACENT WELLS ON THE PRESSURE TRANSIENT ANALYSIS OF A WELL TESTED", "Abstrak": "Pressure transient analysis plays an important role in determining reservoir data properties. Frequently, pressure transient analysis is done by ignoring adjacent wells around the test well. This study will focus on determining the effect of adjacent wells on the pressure transient analysis of the wells tested.\nModel simulations were carried out by doing a drawdown test to obtain the well bottom hole pressure data using CMG IMEX software. The well bottom hole pressure data will be used for pressure transient analysis using Saphir 3.20 software. The analysis uses a homogeneous and naturally fractured reservoir model. The minimum number of wells needed is two units with one well as the adjacent well and the other one as a test well. The adjacent wells can be either production wells or injection wells. Various parameters such as flow rates and well operating times are used to create scenarios to be compared.\nFour case studies are presented with 3 cases have a homogeneous reservoir model and 1 case have a naturally fractured reservoir model. Three homogeneous reservoir cases are distinguished by adjacent wells that operate which are divided into 1 adjacent production well, 1 adjacent injection well, and 1 adjacent production and injection well. An important discovery shows that the presence of adjacent wells can generate different forms of pressure derivative curves depends on the parameters. For a homogeneous reservoir with 1 adjacent production well, a dual-porosity system pressure derivative model is generated and for a naturally fractured reservoir a triple porosity system model is generated. This is important because it can cause errors in determining the model of a reservoir.\nThe novelty of this method can prevent the misinterpretation of a reservoir model due to the adjacent well activity which can influence the reservoir performance forecasting.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Richard Suryaputra [12216023]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Dedy Irawan, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Adjacent well, Pressure derivative, Reservoir model, Simulation", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Jun 2020"}
