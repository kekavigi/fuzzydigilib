{"Nomor": 41024, "Judul": "Feasibility Study On Application Of Volume Acid Fracturing Technology To Tight Gas Carbonate Reservoir Development", "Abstrak": "How to effectively develop tight-gas carbonate reservoir and achieve high recovery is always a\nproblem for the oil and gas industry. To solve this problem, domestic petroleum engineers use the\ncombination of the successful experiences of North American shale gas pools development by\nstimulated reservoir volume (SRV) fracturing with the research achievements of Chinese tight gas\ndevelopment by acid fracturing to propose volume acid fracturing technology for fractured tightgas carbonate reservoir, which has achieved a good stimulation effect in the pilot tests. To determine what reservoir conditions are suitable to carry out volume acid fracturing, this paper firstly\nintroduces volume acid fracturing technology by giving the stimulation mechanism and technical\nideas, and initially analyzes the feasibility by the comparison of reservoir characteristics of shale gas\nwith tight-gas carbonate. Then, this paper analyzes the validity and limitation of the volume acid\nfracturing technology via the analyses of control conditions for volume acid fracturing in reservoir\nfracturing performance, natural fracture, horizontal principal stress difference, orientation of insitu stress and natural fracture, and gives the solution for the limitation. The study results show\nthat the volume acid fracturing process can be used to greatly improve the flow environment of\ntight-gas carbonate reservoir and increase production; the incremental or stimulation response is\nclosely related with reservoir fracturing performance, the degree of development of natural fracture, the small intersection angle between hydraulic fracture and natural fracture, the large horizontal principal stress difference is easy to form a narrow fracture zone, and it is disadvantageous to\ncreate fracture network, but the degradable fiber diversion technology may largely weaken the\ndisadvantage. The practices indicate that the application of volume acid fracturing process to the\ntight-gas carbonate reservoir development is feasible in the Ordovician Majiagou Formation of\nlower Paleozoic, which is of great significance and practical value for domestic tight-gas carbonate\nreservoir development and studies in the future.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "NIANYIN LI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jinxin Dai", "Chao Liu", "Pingli Liu", "Yanming Zhang", "Zhifeng Luo", "Liqiang Zhao"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Tight oil and gas reservoir; Tight carbonate rock; Volume acid fracturing; Fracture network; Ordos basin; SRV", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 3, Pages 206-216 (September  2015), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.06.002", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Jul 2019"}
