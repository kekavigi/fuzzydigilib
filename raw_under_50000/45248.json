{"Nomor": 45248, "Judul": "Eavesdropping attack on a trusted continuous-variable quantum random-number generator", "Abstrak": "Harnessing quantum processes is an efficient method to generate truly indeterministic random numbers, which are of fundamental importance for cryptographic protocols, security applications, or Monte Carlo simulations. Recently, quantum random-number generators based on continuous variables have gathered a lot of attention due to the potentially high bit rates they can deliver. Especially quadrature measurements on shot-noise-limited states have been studied in detail as they do not offer any side information to potential adversaries under ideal experimental conditions. However, they may be subject to additional classical noise beyond the quantum limit, which may become a source of side information for eavesdroppers.While such eavesdropping attacks have been investigated in theory in some detail, experimental studies are still rare. We experimentally realize a continuousvariable eavesdropping attack, based on heterodyne detection, on a trusted quantum random-number generator and discuss the limitations for secure random-number generation that arise.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Johannes Thewes [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Carolin L\u00fcders, and Marc A\u00dfmann"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW A 100, 052318 (2019), APS", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Des 2019"}
