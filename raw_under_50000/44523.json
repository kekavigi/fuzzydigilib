{"Nomor": 44523, "Judul": "Bosscha Observatory: Challenges as a scientific heritage of astronomy in Indonesia", "Abstrak": "With over 80 years of existence, Bosscha Observatory in Lembang, West Java, Indonesia, still stands as one of the largest observatories that is registered by International Astronomical Union in the South East Asia region. Since first commissioned by the NISV (Netherlands\nIndische Sterrenkundige Vereeniging), Bosscha Observatory had played a major role in astronomy, particularly in research and observational activities in the southern hemisphere. But the\ncurrent development has produced a serious impact on Bosscha Observatory, both tangible and\nintangible. With the challenges Bosscha Observatory faced the past decades, what can be done\nin the future to conserve not only the tangible value but most importantly the intangible value\nit embraces for the scientific development? This paper emphasizes its values, and opens some\nperspectives and ideas for conserving a (candidate to) Astronomy and World Heritage site. This\nimportant issue of how to best preserve the scientific value of this scientific heritage it embodied\nis discussed in some detail", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Priscilla Epifania [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Emanuel Sungging Mumpuni"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Astronomy", "Kata Kunci": "Bosscha Observatory, astronomy, scientific heritage, tangible aspect, intangible value, conservation", "Sumber": "International Astronomical Union.
