{"Nomor": 44688, "Judul": "Concurrent Optimization of Rail Transit Alignments and Station Locations", "Abstrak": "Designing urban rail transit systems is a complex problem, which involves the determination of station\nlocations, track geometry, and various other system characteristics. Most of the previous rail transit route optimization studies have focused on the alignment design\nbetween predetermined stations, whereas a practical design\nprocess has to account for the complex interactions among\nrailway alignments and station locations. This paper proposes a methodology for concurrently optimizing station\nlocations and the rail transit alignment connecting those\nstations, by accommodating multiple system objectives,\nsatisfying various design constraints, and integrating the\nanalysis models with a geographical information system\ndatabase. The methodology incorporates demand and station costs in the evaluation framework and employs a\ngenetic algorithm for optimizing the decision variables for\nstation locations, station types, and track alignments. It is\nexpected that transit planners may greatly benefit from the\nproposed methodology, with which they can conveniently\nand efficiently optimize candidate alternatives. The Baltimore Red Line is used as a case study to demonstrate how\nthe model can find very good solutions in regions with\ncomplex geography", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xiaorong Lai1 [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["\u2022 Paul Schonfeld"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering of railroads & roads", "Kata Kunci": "Rail transit  Concurrent optimization Station location  Track alignment", "Sumber": "Urban Rail Transit (2017) 3(3):142\u2013148", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos \u00a0\n                                     Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Okt 2019"}
