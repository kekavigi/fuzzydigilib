{"Nomor": 46131, "Judul": "MOLECULAR DESIGN OF BIOORTHOGONAL PROBES AND IMAGING REAGENTS DERIVED FROM PHOTOFUNCTIONAL TRANSITION METAL COMPLEXES", "Abstrak": "For more than 15 years, bioorthogonal chemistry\nhas received increasing attention due to its successful applications in\nthe detection and imaging of biomolecules in their native biological\nenvironments. The method typically proceeds with the incorporation\nof a biological substrate appended with a bioorthogonal\nfunctional group (chemical reporter), followed by the introduction\nof the substrate to biological systems. Biomolecules containing the\nsubstrate are then recognized by an exogenously delivered\nbioorthogonal probe. Despite the fact that many useful chemical\nreporters and bioorthogonal reactions have been developed, most of\nthe bioorthogonal probes reported thus far are fluorescent dyes. A\nlimitation is that stringent washing is required due to the interference caused by the background fluorescence of unreacted probes. Thus, fluorogenic probes with turn-on emission properties upon bioorthogonal labeling have been designed as an alternative strategy. These probes are highly appealing because excellent images can be obtained without the need for washing steps.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Kenneth Kam [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wing Lo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Molecular Design, Bioorthogonal Probes, Imaging Reagents Derived, Photofunctional Transition Metal Complexes", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Feb 2020"}
