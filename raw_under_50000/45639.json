WRIGHT EX SAUVALLE (MIMOSACEAE) LEAVES ON ALLOXAN-INDUCED DIABETIC MICE", "Abstrak": "Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder that characterized by high blood glucose level. Mimosa\ndiplotricha C. Wright ex Sauvalle synonym with Mimosa invisa Martius was traditionally used to\ntreat diabetes mellitus. Therefore, the research was done to investigate the anti-diabetic activity\nof ethanol extract of Mimosa invisa leaves on alloxan-induced diabetic mice to provide the\nrationale for the use of Mimosa invisa leaves as traditional anti-diabetic agent. Diabetes was\ninduced on Swiss Webster female mice with 45 mg/kg bw alloxan monohydrate intravenously.\nFour doses of extract were tested i.e., 10, 20, 50 and 100 mg/kg bw. The parameters that been\ndetermined were blood glucose level and the antioxidant activity through DPPH test. After 14\ndays of orally administration of the extract, the low dose i.e., 10 and 20 mg/kg bw, the extract\nshowed no anti-diabetic effect while at high dose i.e., 50 and 100 mg/kg bw showed anti-diabetic\nactivity by decrease blood glucose level very significantly (p<0.01) started from day of\nadministration. The percentage reduction of blood glucose level for extract at high dose 50 and\n100 mg/kg bw were 54.7 and 56.2 % respectively. Based on DPPH test, the extract showed\nantioxidant activity with IC50 31.3 ppm. The ethanol extract of Mimosa invisa leaves at dose 50\nand 100 mg/kg bw were equivalent with dried leaves powder 1.8 and 3.6 g for human calculated\nbased on water content, had anti-diabetic effect on alloxan-induced diabetic mice.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Kong San Chee": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/195172"}, "Penulis": "Kong San Chee [10712707]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Maria Immaculata Iwo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sains dan Teknologi Farmasi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Farmasi", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Mimosa diplotricha, anti-diabetic, alloxan monohydrate, DPPH, blood glucose level", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Jan 2020"}
