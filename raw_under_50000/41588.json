{"Nomor": 41588, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT OF MANUAL FOR SAIL-FLIGHT TEST PROGRAM OF WING-IN-SURFACE EFFECT CRAFT (Case Study: WiSE-8 W1)", "Abstrak": "Flight test of an aircraft is a process fundamental to the development and advancement of\naeronautical knowledge in order to validate the operation and the systems on an aircraft,\nalso to provide data for the Operation Flight Manual. Sea trial of a ship is full scale trials to\ndetermine ship maneuvering characteristics and maneuverability as a reaction to water\nrudder and engine actions.\nThe requirements are implemented for Wing-in-Surface Effect (WiSE) craft, a surface effect\nvehicle, for which undergo flight phase on its operation and also experience on-water\nmaneuver then clustered in Sail-Flight Test Program. The various activities and aspects of\nSail-Flight Test Engineering must be considered when planning, conducting, and reporting\nthe test program. In conducting such activities, test manual is an absolute necessity to\nguide the program and provide adequate database template to record the data.\nThis thesis describes various subjects of sail-flight tests that are conducted during the\ndevelopment of a newly developed wing-in-surface effect craft. Pre-Sail-Flight Tests are\nactivities done simultaneously with design and engineering of the craft, followed by\nGround Test as preparation phase to ensure that the craft fulfill the condition required for\nSea Trial and Flight Test. Sea Trial consists of on-water maneuvering test, while Flight Test\ninvolving flight maneuvers of a wing-in-surface effect craft. Each Section offers a brief\nintroduction to the topic under consideration, the nature and the objectives of the tests to\nbe conducted. It also discusses the test instrumentation required, describes the test\nmaneuvers and techniques to be executed, and indicates the way in which the test\nparameters is selected, analyzed, and presented. Items to be discussed involving:\nevaluation of test data to be compared with predicted data and the activities that must\ntake place upon completion of the test program.\nAt present, there is no known particular manual developed yet for Wing in Surface Effect\ncraft, especially in Indonesia, which accommodate its specific characteristic. This research\nwill focus on developing a comprehensive sail-flight test manual to be used as a general\nguideline to carry out the sail-flight test program. This thesis will provide complete\ninformation for the engineer to get them familiarize with sea trial as well as flight test\ntechniques, a perspective or framework which assess the wing in surface effect test\nprogram and put together an executable plan to achieve those goals.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Dyah Jatiningrum": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/179428", "BAB 1 Dyah Jatiningrum": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/179429", "BAB 3 Dyah Jatiningrum": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/179430", "BAB 2 Dyah Jatiningrum": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/179431", "BAB 4 Dyah Jatiningrum": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/179432", "BAB 5 Dyah Jatiningrum": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/179433", "BAB 6 Dyah Jatiningrum": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/179434", "BAB 7 Dyah Jatiningrum": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/179436", "BAB 8 Dyah Jatiningrum": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/179437", "PUSTAKA Dyah Jatiningrum": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/179439"}, "Penulis": "Dyah Jatiningrum [23606002]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Hari Muhammad"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "sail-flight test manual, wing in surface effect craft, sail-flight test technique", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "10 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Agu 2019"}
