{"Nomor": 45263, "Judul": "Hydrocarbon Inventory Of The Eastern Part Of The Rio Del Rey Basin Using Seismic Attributes", "Abstrak": "The use of seismic attributes for understanding reservoir complexity has been proven to work in several felds. Thus, we\ndemonstrate applications of seismic attributes for evaluating the oil and gas reservoirs in the eastern portion of the Rio del\nRey (RDR) Basin. The presence of these fuids in twenty-six (26) reservoirs of the study area was confrmed with the help\nof Larson VizEx Pro software using well and seismic data. The 3D merged seismic data reprocessed in 2011 were used to\nextract the root-mean-square (RMS) and maximum amplitude attributes for each of the reservoirs. Forty-seven (47) RMS\nand maximum surface attributes were generated using Petrel E&P 2014 software. Seven (7) of these attributes have been\npresented. Quality control using Interactive Petrophysics (IP) software was applied on the reservoir fuid type found in each\nwell. These fuid types were later superposed on each of the amplitude maps to match the corresponding amplitude responses.\nA good match could be observed between some well tops and their corresponding amplitude values. The results obtained\nindicate that GH and WX concessions could be the best concessions in the eastern part of the RDR Basin since most of their\nreservoirs, especially WX S6.3 maximum amplitude map, matched with their well fuid contents. The results obtained have\nbeen used to propose potential areas for further drilling.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "K. F. FOZAO [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["L. Fotso", "A.
