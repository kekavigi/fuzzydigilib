{"Nomor": 44763, "Judul": "The Fluidesolid Coupling Analysis Of Screw Conveyor In Drilling Fluid Centrifuge Based On ANSYS", "Abstrak": "In the centrifugal separations of drilling fluid, screw conveyor is a critical component to push and\nseparate the sediment. The work performance and structural parameters of conveyor are immediately related to the production capability, the working life and the separating effect of the\ncentrifuge. The existing researches always use the theoretical calculation of the approximate loads\nto analyze the strength of conveyor, and it cannot reflect the stress situations accurately. In order to\nensure the precise mastery of the working performance, this article obtained pressure distribution\nunder working conditions from CFX evaluation and gained equivalent stress and deformation under\nseveral load conditions by using the ANSYS Workbench platform to check the strength of conveyor.\nThe results showed that the influence of centrifugal hydraulic pressure was less than that of centrifugal force on the strength and deformation of conveyor. Besides, the maximum equivalent stress\noccurred at the inside of the feed opening, while the maximum deformation occurred at the\nconveyor blade edge of taper extremity. Furthermore, whether considered the feed opening or not,\nthe computing model had a great influence on the analysis results, and the simplified loads had a\ngreat influence on the deformation analysis results. The methods and results from this article can\nprovide reference for the design and the improvement of screw conveyor", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "HONGBIN LIU [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pingying Li", "Huina Xiao", "Weitao Mu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Drilling fluid centrifuge, Screw conveyor, Fluidesolid coupling, Equivalent stress", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 3, Pages 251-256 (September  2015),  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.07.009", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "05 Nov 2019"}
