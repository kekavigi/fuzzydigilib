{"Nomor": 45011, "Judul": "Resolution-induced anisotropy in large-eddy simulations", "Abstrak": "Large-eddy simulation (LES) of turbulence in complex geometries and domains is often\nconducted with high-aspect-ratio resolution cells of varying shapes and orientations. The\neffects of such anisotropic resolution are often simplified or neglected in subgrid model\nformulations. Here, we examine resolution-induced anisotropy and demonstrate that even\nfor isotropic turbulence, anisotropic resolution induces mild resolved Reynolds stress\nanisotropy and significant anisotropy in second-order resolved velocity gradient statistics.\nIn large-eddy simulations of homogeneous isotropic turbulence with anisotropic resolution,\nit is shown that commonly used subgrid models, including those that consider resolution\nanisotropy in their formulation, perform poorly. The one exception is the anisotropic\nminimum dissipation model proposed by Rozema et al. [Phys. Fluids 27, 085107 (2015)].\nA simple model is presented here that is an anisotropic eddy diffusivity extension of the\n\u201cKolmogorov expression\u201d eddy viscosity of Carati et al. [A family of dynamic models\nfor large-eddy simulation, in Annual Research Briefs, Center for Turbulence Research\n(Stanford University and NASA AMES, 1995), pp. 35\u201340] that depends explicitly on the\nanisotropy of the resolution. It also performs well and is remarkable because, unlike other\nLES subgrid models, the eddy diffusivity only depends on statistical characteristics of\nthe turbulence (in this case, the dissipation rate), not on fluctuating quantities. In other\nsubgrid modeling formulations, such as the dynamic procedure, limiting flow dependence\nto statistical quantities in this way could have advantages.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Sigfried W.
