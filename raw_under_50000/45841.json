{"Nomor": 45841, "Judul": "Quantitative evaluation of relative contribution of high-valent iron species and sulfate radical in Fe(VI) enhanced oxidation processes via sulfur reducing agents activation", "Abstrak": "Recently, it has been reported that sulfur reducing agents (e.g., sulfite and thiosulfate) can effectively activate Fe(VI), leading to a fast degradation of various contaminants. However, the reactive intermediates (i.e., high-valent iron species versus free radicals) involved in the Fe(VI)/sulfite and Fe(VI)/thiosulfate systems remain far from clear....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yuan Gao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Su-Yan Pang, Zhen Wang, Yong-Ming Shena, Jin Jiang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Fe(VI), Sulfite, Thiosulfate, High-valent iron intermediate, Sulfate radical", "Sumber": "Chemical Engineering Journal journal, www.elsevier.com/locate/cej", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Jan 2020"}
