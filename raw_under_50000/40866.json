{"Nomor": 40866, "Judul": "Excited States in Bilayer Graphene Quantum Dots", "Abstrak": "We report ground- and excited-state transport through an electrostatically defined few-hole quantum dot\nin bilayer graphene in both parallel and perpendicular applied magnetic fields. A remarkably clear level\nscheme for the two-particle spectra is found by analyzing finite bias spectroscopy data within a two-particle\nmodel including spin and valley degrees of freedom. We identify the two-hole ground state to be a spintriplet and valley-singlet state. This spin alignment can be seen as Hund\u2019s rule for a valley-degenerate\nsystem, which is fundamentally different from quantum dots in carbon nanotubes, where the two-particle\nground state is a spin-singlet state. The spin-singlet excited states are found to be valley-triplet states by\ntilting the magnetic field with respect to the sample plane.We quantify the exchange energy to be 0.35 meV\nand measure a valley and spin g factor of 36 and 2, respectively.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "A.
