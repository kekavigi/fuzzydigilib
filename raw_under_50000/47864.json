The growing use of volatile,\nrenewable energy sources culminates in the need for storage as well as\ntransportation capabilities in the grids of tomorrow. Transmission and distribution\ngrids worldwide are based on alternating current (AC), a well-established\ntechnology. This concept works reliable and stable but comes along with some\nrestrictions. The transmittable power is limited by factors like the need for reactive\npower, which affects the maximum transmission length. Furthermore, dielectric\nlosses as well as the skin effect limit the efficiency of AC power transmission. Due\nto these restrictions, the use of Direct Current (DC) can be beneficial. The Medium\nVoltage Direct Current (MVDC) power transmission is a promising approach to\nenhance the transport capacity of transmission links, such as cables or overhead\nlines. As several publications point out, the possibility of converting existing\nMedium Voltage Alternating Current (MVAC) overhead lines (OHL) to DC\noperation, the aspect of using overhead lines in such systems has to be investigated.\nTherefore, locally used MVAC insulators (Austria, Indonesia) as well as conductors\nare tested in terms of flashover strength and audible noise behaviour under DC\nvoltages. Environmental parameters like moisture, temperature and surface\npollution are to be considered. In terms of audible noise, overhead line conductors\noperated with DC voltage do not significantly affect the increase in audible noise\nand the value obtained is around 23-30 dB. It is the same as rustling leaves and\nwill not have a significant impact on the surrounding environment. Meanwhile, in\nterms of flashover voltage, taking into account light pollution, the possibility of DC\nvoltage that can be applied to Austrian overhead lines up to \u00b1 60 kV DC and the\ntransmitted power increases by 408%. Meanwhile, for Indonesian overhead lines\nup to \u00b1 40 kV DC can be considered and the power transferred can increase by\n272%. From a technical point of view, MVAC overhead lines can be converted with\nDC voltage without replacing existing equipment. Only the addition of converter\nequipment is needed to convert voltage from AC to DC and vice versa. However,\nfor determining the DC voltage used, knowledge about the geographical location\nand the resulting pollution as well as further line-specific calculations regarding\ninsulation coordination are required.", "Daftar File": {"Abstract": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/207408", "Cover": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/207580", "Lembar Pengesahan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/207581"}, "Penulis": "Sinanuri Surawijaya [23218007]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
