{"Nomor": 41319, "Judul": "Potency to Recycle Hydrapulper Reject Waste of Paper Mill into Composite Particleboard", "Abstrak": "Solid waste of paper mill hydrapulper rejects (HR) has a relatively high plastic content, with\naround 45-49% composition of the total HR. About 99% of the plastic has the category of\nHigh-Density Polyethylene (HDPE). HDPE is a type of Polyethylene (PE) plastic which has\nhigh recyclability and may be reformed at high temperature. This study tries to describe the\npotential of producing particleboards derived from HR using a hot-press method. Molded\nHR was being hot-pressed at a pressure of 25 kgf/cm2 for 5 \u2013 15 minutes of residence time,\nwith a variation of the amount of HR from 150-500 g, and variations in hot-press\ntemperature of 150-180\u00b0C. Products were then analyzed for parameters such as moisture\ncontent, density, water absorption, thickness swelling, and internal bond and compared to\nSNI 03-2105-2006 and JIS A 5908-2003 standard. The results showed that most of the\nsamples were relatively accepted to the SNI, with only a few data could meet JIS. The best\nresults are obtained at HR weight of 250 g with 165 and 180\u00b0C pressing temperature and\npressing time more than 10 minutes. The addition of HDPE pellets showed an increment of\ndensity and decrement of moisture content of particleboard, while the addition of Maleic\nAnhydride (MA) showed some decrements of moisture content and water absorption of\nparticleboard.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Andri Taufick Rizaluddin [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yusup Setiawan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "Hydrapulper reject,  HDPE,  Particleboard,  Fiber", "Sumber": "Jurnal Riset Teknologi Pencegahan Pencemaran Industri   Vol. 10 No. 1 (2019) 1-11", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Agu 2019"}
