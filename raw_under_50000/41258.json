{"Nomor": 41258, "Judul": "INTERFACIAL BEHAVIOR OF PIPE JOINTSUNDER TORSIONLOADS", "Abstrak": "The interfacial behavior of pipe joints is studied in this paper. Firstly, through\nnonlinear fracture mechanics, the analytical expressions of interfacial shear stress and the load-\ndisplacement relationship at loaded end of pipe joints under torsion loads are obtained. Thus\nthe shear stress propagation and the debonding process of the whole interface for different bond\nlengths can be predicted. Secondly, through the analytical solutions, the influences of different\nbond lengths on the load-displacement curve and the ultimate load are studied. The stress trans-\nfer mechanism, the interface crack propagation and the ductility behavior of the joints can be\nexplained.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jun Han [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hong Yuan,  Jiayu Wu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "interface, failure mechanism, softening, debonding, torsion, pipe joints", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 5, October, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Agu 2019"}
