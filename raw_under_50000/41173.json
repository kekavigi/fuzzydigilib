CNT functionalizations will improve dispersion and strengthen interfacial\nbonding of CNTs in matrices. To understand the effects of different functionalization schemes\non the interfacial strength of CNT-polymer composites, pullout of the covalent, noncovalent, and\nmixed functionalized single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) from polyethylene (PE) matrix\nwas simulated by using molecular dynamics, respectively. The results show that the SWCNT-PE\ninterfacial shear strength is significantly improved by SWCNT functionalizations, particularly by\nmixed functionalization.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Tan Xiao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Juqing Liu, Huifang Xiong"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "interfacial shear strength, carbon nanotubes, nano composites, molecular dynamics", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 3, June, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Jul 2019"}
