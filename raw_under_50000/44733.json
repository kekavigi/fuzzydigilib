{"Nomor": 44733, "Judul": "Quantum Rydberg Central Spin Model", "Abstrak": "We consider dynamics of a Rydberg impurity in a cloud of ultracold bosonic atoms in which the Rydberg\nelectron undergoes spin-changing collisions with surrounding atoms. This system realizes a new type of\nquantum impurity problems that compounds essential features of the Kondo model, the Bose polaron, and the central spin model. To capture the interplay of the Rydberg-electron spin dynamics and the orbital motion of atoms, we employ a new variational method that combines an impurity-decoupling transformation with a Gaussian ansatz for the bath particles. We find several unexpected features of this model that are not present in traditional impurity problems, including interaction-induced renormalization of the absorption spectrum that eludes simple explanations from molecular bound states, and long-lasting\noscillations of the Rydberg-electron spin. We discuss generalizations of our analysis to other systems in\natomic physics and quantum chemistry, where an electron excitation of high orbital quantum number\ninteracts with a spinful quantum bath.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "YUTO ASHIDA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Richard Schmidt,", "H.
