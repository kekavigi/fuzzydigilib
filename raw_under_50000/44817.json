{"Nomor": 44817, "Judul": "A Review On Hydraulic Fracturing Of Unconventional Reservoir", "Abstrak": "Hydraulic fracturing is widely accepted and applied to improve the gas recovery in unconventional\nreservoirs. Unconventional reservoirs to be addressed here are with very low permeability,\ncomplicated geological settings and in-situ stress field etc. All of these make the hydraulic fracturing process a challenging task. In order to effectively and economically recover gas from such\nreservoirs, the initiation and propagation of hydraulic fracturing in the heterogeneous fractured/\nporous media under such complicated conditions should be mastered. In this paper, some issues\nrelated to hydraulic fracturing have been reviewed, including the experimental study, field study\nand numerical simulation. Finally the existing problems that need to be solved on the subject of\nhydraulic fracturing have been proposed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "QUANSHU LI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Huilin Xing", "Jianjun Liu", "Xiangchon Liu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Hydraulic fracturing, Unconventional reservoirs, Heterogeneity, Numerical method", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 1, Pages 8-15 (March  2015),    http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.03.008", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Nov 2019"}
