{"Nomor": 41010, "Judul": "Spatial variability of inorganic nutrients and physical parameters in the waters of Bahia Magdalena lagoon, Pacific Coast, Mexico", "Abstrak": "Seventy-seven water samples were collected at the surface (S) and bottom (B) water profiles along eight transects (T1\u2013T8) fromBahiaMagdalena lagoon, Baja California Sur,Mexico during October 2014 to evaluate the spatial distribution patterns of dissolved inorganic nutrients (nitrates, nitrites and phosphates). Seawater properties (pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, density and conductivity) were measured using a CTD instrument to assess their vertical profiling....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "S.B.
