{"Nomor": 45098, "Judul": "Comparison Of Machine Learning Methods For Estimating Permeability And Porosity Of Oil Reservoirs Via Petro-Physical Logs", "Abstrak": "This paper deals with the comparison of models for predicting porosity and permeability of oil reservoirs\nby coupling a machine learning concept and petrophysical logs. Different machine learning methods\nincluding conventional artificial neural network, genetic algorithm, fuzzy decision tree, the imperialist\ncompetitive algorithm (ICA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and a hybrid of those ones are employed\nto have a comprehensive comparison. The machine learning approach was constructed and tested via\ndata samples recorded from northern Persian Gulf oil reservoirs. The results gained from the machine\nlearning models used in this paper are compared to the relevant real petrophysical data and the outputs\nachieved by other methods employed in our previous studies. The average relative absolute deviation\nbetween the approach estimations and the relevant actual data is found to be less than 1% for the hybridized approaches. The results reported in this paper indicate that implication of hybridized machine\nlearning methods in porosity and permeability estimations can lead to the construction of more reliable\nstatic reservoir models in simulation plans.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MOHAMMAD ALI AHMADI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zhangxing Chen"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Machine learning, Neural network, Support vector machine, Porosity, Permeability, Well logs, Petro-physic", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 5, Issue 3, Pages 271-284 (September 2019), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.06.002", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Nov 2019"}
