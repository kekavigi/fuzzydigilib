{"Nomor": 41164, "Judul": "NUMERICAL SIMULATIONOF LOADING EDGE CRACKS BY EDGE IMPACT USING THE EXTENDED FINITE ELEMENT METHOD", "Abstrak": "The extended finite element method is used to analyze a plate with two parallel\nedge cracks impacted by a cylindrical projectile. The influence of the impact speed, crack length,\nplate thickness and notch tip radius on the crack initiation and propagation is studied. Dynamics\nequations are solved by an implicit time integration scheme which is unconditionally stable. Very\ngood agreement is achieved between numerical predictions and experimental results. The critical\nvelocity of the crack initiation under different conditions is examined. The influence of the crack\nlength is greater than that of the impact speed, plate thickness and notch tip radius.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Qinghua Meng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zhenqing Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "extended finite element method, crack propagation, dynamic impact, implicit dynamics", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 2, April, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Jul 2019"}
