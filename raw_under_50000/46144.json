{"Nomor": 46144, "Judul": "OCULAR HALF-LIFE OF INTRAVITREAL BIOLOGICS IN HUMANS AND OTHER SPECIES: META-ANALYSIS AND MODEL-BASED PREDICTION", "Abstrak": "Therapeutic antibodies administered intravitreally are the current standard of\ncare to treat retinal diseases. The ocular half-life (t1/2) is a key determinant of the duration of\ntarget suppression. To support the development of novel, longer-acting drugs, a reliable\ndetermination of t1/2 is needed together with an improved understanding of the factors that\ninfluence it. A model-based meta-analysis was conducted in humans and nonclinical species\n(rat, rabbit, monkey, and pig) to determine consensus values for the ocular t1/2 of IgG\nantibodies and Fab fragments. Results from multiple literature and in-house pharmacokinetic\nstudies are presented within a mechanistic framework that assumes diffusion-controlled drug\nelimination from the vitreous. Our analysis shows, both theoretically and experimentally, that\nthe ocular t1/2 increases in direct proportion to the product of the hydrodynamic radius of the\nmacromolecule (3.0 nm for Fab and 5.0 nm for IgG) and the square of the radius of the\nvitreous globe, which varies approximately 24-fold from the rat to the human. Interspecies\ndifferences in the proportionality factors are observed and discussed in mechanistic terms. In\naddition, mathematical formulae are presented that allow prediction of the ocular t1/2 for\nmolecules of interest. The utility of these formulae is successfully demonstrated in case studies of aflibercept, brolucizumab, and\nPEGylated Fabs, where the predicted ocular t1/2 values are found to be in reasonable agreement with the experimental data available\nfor these molecules.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Antonello Caruso [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Matthias Fu?th, Ruben Alvarez-Sa?nchez"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "macromolecule, intravitreal, pharmacokinetics, ocular half-life, hydrodynamic radius, diffusion, meta-analysis", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Feb 2020"}
