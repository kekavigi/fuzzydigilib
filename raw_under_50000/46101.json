{"Nomor": 46101, "Judul": "IMPROVED BIOACTIVITY OF THE NATURAL PRODUCT 5?LIPOXYGENASE INHIBITOR HYPERFORIN BY ENCAPSULATION INTO POLYMERIC NANOPARTICLES", "Abstrak": "Hyperforin, a highly hydrophobic prenylated acylphloroglucinol\nfrom the medical plant St. John\u2019s Wort, possesses anti-inflammatory properties and\nsuppresses the formation of proinflammatory leukotrienes by inhibiting the key\nenzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). Despite its strong effectiveness and the unique\nmolecular mode of interference with 5-LO, the high lipophilicity of hyperforin\nhampers its efficacy in vivo and, thus, impairs its therapeutic value, especially\nbecause of poor water solubility and strong plasma (albumin) protein binding. To\novercome these hurdles that actually apply to many other hydrophobic 5-LO\ninhibitors, we have encapsulated hyperforin into nanoparticles (NPs) consisting of acetalated dextran (AcDex) to avoid plasmam protein binding and thus improve its cellular supply under physiologically relevant conditions. Encapsulated hyperforin potently suppressed 5-LO activity in human neutrophils, but it failed to interfere with 5-LO activity in a cell-free assay, as expected. In the presence of human serum albumin (HSA), hyperforin was unable to inhibit cellular 5-LO activity, seemingly because of strong albumin binding. However, when encapsulated into NPs, hyperforin caused strong inhibition of 5-LO activity in the presence of HSA. Together, encapsulation of the highly hydrophobic hyperforin as a representative of lipophilic 5-LO inhibitors into AcDexbased NPs allows for efficient inhibition of 5-LO activity in neutrophils in the presence of albumin because of effective uptake and circumvention of plasma protein binding.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Anja Traeger [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Susanna Volker"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "hyperforin, 5-lipoxygenase, leukotriene, drug encapsulation, acetalated dextran, nanoparticle", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Feb 2020"}
