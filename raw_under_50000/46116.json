{"Nomor": 46116, "Judul": "FLUORESCENT PROBES FOR THE VISUALIZATION OF CELL VIABILITY", "Abstrak": "Monitoring cell viability is a crucial task essential for the\nfundamental studies in apoptosis, necrosis, and drug discovery. Cell apoptosis\nand necrosis are significant to maintain the cell population, and their\nabnormality can lead to severe diseases including cancer. During cell death,\nsignificant changes occur in the intracellular contents and physical properties,\nsuch as decrease of esterase activity, depolarization of the mitochondrial\nmembrane potential (??m), increase of caspase content, dissipation of\nmembrane asymmetry, and loss of membrane integrity. To detect cell viability,\nthe fluorescent probes have been developed by taking advantage of these\nbiological parameters and using various fluorescence mechanisms. These\nfluorescent probes can serve as powerful tools to facilitate the research in\nbiology and pathology.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Minggang Tian [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": [",\u2020 Yanyan Ma, Weiying Lin"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Visualization of Cell Viability", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Feb 2020"}
