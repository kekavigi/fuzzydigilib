{"Nomor": 48096, "Judul": "OPTIMAL TUNING OF UNIFIED POWER FLOW CONTROLLER USING FIREFLY ALGORITHM TO IMPROVE DAMPING OF INTER-AREA OSCILLATIONS IN MULTI-MACHINE SYSTEM", "Abstrak": "Inter-Area Oscillations is a challenge in the interconnection system that affects the\nstability of the power system. Conventional Power System Stabilizer (PSS) used\nto reduce small signal oscillations has limitations in Inter-Area Oscillations.\nTherefore, in this thesis, a Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) damping\ncontrol scheme is introduced. The control parameters of UPFC-based PI\nControllers are tuned with the Firefly Algorithm to increase the damping of InterArea Oscillations in a multi-machine system. The performance will be compared\nwith PSS-UPFC, which is optimized using CRPSO from the literature. Firefly\nAlgorithm is also used to present coordinated tuning between PSS-UPFC, and the\nresults will be compared with systems that use PSS or UPFC only, in which the\nparameters have also been optimized. Based on load changes and three-phase fault\nsimulation, the proposed UPFC-Based PI Controller is proven to be able to\nincrease the eigenvalues of the system under different conditions and provides\nbetter results in time-domain analysis, by reducing overshoot, acceleration settling\ntime, and minimizing graph area.", "Daftar File": {"Abstract": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/207747", "Lembar Pengesahan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/207748"}, "Penulis": "Rathy Shinta Utami [23218059]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
