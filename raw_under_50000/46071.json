{"Nomor": 46071, "Judul": "ESTABLISHING CATION AND RADICAL DONOR ABILITY SCALES OF ELECTROPHILIC F, CF3, AND SCF3 TRANSFER REAGENTS", "Abstrak": "Because of their unique biological, physical,\nand chemical properties, organofluorine compounds play an\nincreasingly important role in numerous areas of chemistry\nand everyday life. However, although fluorine is the most\nabundant halogen in the earth\u2019s crust and ranks 13th in abundance\namong all elements, naturally occurring organofluorine\ncompounds are rare. Consequently, there is a growing demand\nfor the development of safe and efficient reagents and selective\nsynthetic methodologies for the introduction of fluorine or\nfluorine-containing groups into organic compounds. A wide\nvariety of shelf-stable electrophilic fluorinating and fluoroalkylating\nreagents have been developed in the past decades. Some of them have also been shown to act as radical sources. These versatile reagents have promoted revolutionary advances in synthetic fluorine chemistry.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Man Li [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiao-Song Xue and Jin-Pei Cheng"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Establishing Cation, Radical Donor Ability Scales, Electrophilic F, CF3, and SCF3 Transfer Reagents", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Feb 2020"}
