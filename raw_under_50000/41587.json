{"Nomor": 41587, "Judul": "TWO DIMENSIONAL PARTICLE IMAGE VELOCIMETRY (PIV) MEASUREMENTS ON THE DOWN-STROKE FLAPPING WING", "Abstrak": "Flapping wing flight stands out as one of the most complex yet widespread\nmodes of transportation found in nature. Over a million different species of insects\nfly with flapping wings, and 10,000 types of birds and bats flap their wings for\nlocomotion. This proliferation of flying species has also attracted scientific\nattention. Biologists and naturalists have produced kinematic descriptions of\nflapping wing motion and empirical correlations between flapping frequency,\nweight, wingspan, and power requirements based on studies of many different\nfamilies of birds and insects. Bio-fluiddynamicists have attempted to explain the\nunderlying physical phenomena both in the quasi-steady limit and in the fully\nunsteady regime, and it has long been realized that steady-state aerodynamics\ndoes not accurately account for the forces produced by natural fliers, and this has\nprompted several studies on the unsteady flow produced. Mechanisms such as\nrotational circulation, wake capture, and the unsteady leading edge vortex do seem\nto properly account for the aerodynamics forces.\nThe study about unsteady flow mechanism recently is developing faster\nand more accurate. Several great experiments of flapping wing robotics arm have\na good result in quantifying this phenomenon. This experiment has a widely\ntechniques to visualization the flow phenomenon of unsteady flapping wing. For\nexample : Dickinson et al using DPIV system to quantifying the flow field, Liu et\nal using a smoke generator to visualize a Leading Edge Vortex (LEV), Ho et al\nusing smoke wire visualization, etc. The other important key to understanding the\nflow phenomenon is to understand the wing kinematics it self, thus modeling a\nwing kinematics of flapping wing via a robotics arm is also must be considered\nwell.\nIn this research area, the unsteady flapping wing flow is choose to\nvisualized by DPIV system, several experiment is done to follow the wing\nkinematics of insect flight in the towing tank. The flapping kinematics is analyze\non the down-stroke with stroke angle is 90o, and furthermore, the aerodynamics\nforces is measure by using a momentum, flux, and impulse methods.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Vicky Wuwung": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/179421", "BAB 1 Vicky Wuwung": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/179422", "BAB 2 Vicky Wuwung": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/179423", "BAB 3 Vicky Wuwung": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/179424", "BAB 4 Vicky Wuwung": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/179425", "BAB 5 Vicky Wuwung": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/179426", "PUSTAKA Vicky Wuwung": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/179427"}, "Penulis": "Vicky Wuwung [23605302]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Lavi Rizki Zuhal"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "velocimetry (PIV); flaping wing.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Agu 2019"}
