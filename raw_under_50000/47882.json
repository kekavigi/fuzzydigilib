The degree of polymerization (DP) of paper insulation is\nconsidered a good indicator of a determined deterioration level of insulation paper\nthat indicates the remnant life of the transformer. In these years, researchers have\nbeen able to implement classification analysis methods on a power transformer\nthrough a database of measurement data. Further studies related to the\ndevelopment of machine learning for the assessment of power transformers must be\naccomplished in order to formulate a comprehensive model.\nIn this master thesis, the objective is to develop a reliable algorithm to determine\nthe current state of the oil-paper insulation based on the monitoring characteristics.\nWith nominal classification base and numerically base using Fuzzy Inference\nSystem (FIS) and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), and study its\nbehavior. Both methods evaluate dielectric characteristic parameters, i.e., Acidity\nand Interfacial Tensile (IFT), of the insulating oil, and Dissolved Gas Analysis\n(DGA) measurement results; the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) and\ncarbon dioxide (CO2), and four possible combinations variable input.\nThe results state that the estimation method by using the classification data input\nvariable gives a better estimation outcome compared to the numerical data input.\nIt can be seen in the performance of the FIS method is better in the evaluation based\non the deviation/error value and the accuracy in the class estimation. In contrast,\nthe BPNN tends to have a wider deviation value.\nThe comparison shows that, in addition to Furan content-based DP estimations,\nboth models can be used to predict the value of DP accurately and to improve the\nreliability of the result.", "Daftar File": {"Abstract": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/207437"}, "Penulis": "Martua Mario Gultom [23218049]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
