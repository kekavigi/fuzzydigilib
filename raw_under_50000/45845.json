{"Nomor": 45845, "Judul": "STRESS ANALYSIS OF KOMATSU HD785-7 DUMP TRUCK\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdS CHASSIS WITH SEVERAL LOAD CASES", "Abstrak": "A dump truck is a vehicle that is usually used to transport loose materials, typically\nin mining or construction industries. As one of the main components of a dump truck, chassis\nplays a pivotal role in the overall performance of the dump truck. Chassis acts as a structural\nbackbone of a vehicle, it integrates and supports the dump truck\u2019s main components such as\nengine, tires, axles, body, cabin, trailers, etc. It is also subjected to various loads during all\noperation conditions. Due to the importance of a chassis, it should be reassured that the\nchassis is safe and strong enough to withstand loads in every operating condition. For this\nreason, it is necessary to do stress analysis on the structure by using finite element method.\nIn this undergraduate final project, stress analysis were performed under several\nconditions. Load cases that were modeled include: (1) bending, (2) torsion, (3) combined\nbetween bending and torsion, (4) acceleration, (5) braking, and (6) cornering. The geometry\nwas modeled using SolidWorks and the finite element analysis was carried out using ANSYS.\nThrough this analysis, the maximum stress and critical locations where the highest stress may\noccur were obtained.\nThe results of the analysis show that critical areas are located at the welding region\nbetween two parts of the rear axle mounting and at the welding region between front members\nand the mid vertical members. However, the front critical area is chosen to be the most critical\nas it occurs during normal operating condition. Hence detailed modeling of the welding area\nis performed in this area. The maximum stress at this area is 185.34 MPa.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Ahmad Naufal Winanda": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/198192", "COVER Ahmad Naufal Winanda": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/254189", "PUSTAKA Ahmad Naufal Winanda": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/254195"}, "Penulis": "Ahmad Naufal Winanda [13115038]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Satrio Wicaksono, S.T., M.Eng., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Mesin", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Dump truck, chassis, finite element analysis, critical areas, maximum stress", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "8 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Jan 2020"}
