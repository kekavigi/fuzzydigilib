{"Nomor": 45174, "Judul": "Underlying Structure of Collective Bands and Self-Organization in Quantum Systems", "Abstrak": "The underlying structure of low-lying collective bands of atomic nuclei is discussed from a novel\nperspective on the interplay between single-particle and collective degrees of freedom, by utilizing state-of-the-art configuration interaction calculations on heavy nuclei. Besides the multipole components of the\nnucleon-nucleon interaction that drive collective modes forming those bands, the monopole component is\nshown to control the resistance against such modes. The calculated structure of 154Sm corresponds to the\ncoexistence between prolate and triaxial shapes, while that of 166Er exhibits a deformed shape with a strong triaxial instability. Both findings differ from traditional views based on ?=? vibrations. The formation of\ncollective bands is shown to be facilitated from a self-organization mechanism.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "T. Otsuka [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Y. Tsunoda, T.
