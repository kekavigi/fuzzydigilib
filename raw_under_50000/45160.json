{"Nomor": 45160, "Judul": "Mechanical Performance Analysis Of Hollow Cylindrical Roller Bearing Of Cone Bit by FEM", "Abstrak": "Bearings are key components of cone bit, thus its rapid failure is a major cause of leading to lower\nlife of the bit. To improve the bearing performance and prolong working life, contact mechanics of\nhollow cylindrical roller bearing of cone bit was simulated. Effects of hollow size, drilling pressure,\nfriction coefficient and fitting clearance on mechanics performance of the bearing were studied.\nThe results show that the maximum equivalent stress of the hollow cylindrical roller bearing\nappears on the claw journal, and the maximum contact stress appears on the contact pair of the\nhollow roller. Besides, hollow sizes have a greater impact on the equivalent stress and contact stress\nof the cylindrical roller, while the influence on the stress of the cone and claw journal is relatively\nsmall. With the increasing of the drilling pressure and fitting clearance, equivalent stress and\ncontact stress of bearing parts increase. The friction coefficient has little impact on mechanical\nperformance of the bearing. As the 121/4SWPI517 type hollow cylindrical roller bearing of cone bit\nan example, the optimal hollow size is 55%, the drilling pressure is 140 kN and the fitting clearance\nis 0e0.02 mm.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "CHUANJUN HAN [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Cheng Yu", "Ying Li", "Jiawei Yan", "Jie Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Cone bit, Hollow cylindrical roller bearing, Finite element method, Contact stresss, Mechanical property", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 4, Pages 388-396 (December  2015), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.10.012", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Nov 2019"}
