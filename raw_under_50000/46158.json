{"Nomor": 46158, "Judul": "CO2 REDUCTION: FROM HOMOGENEOUS TO HETEROGENEOUS ELECTROCATALYSIS", "Abstrak": "Due to increasing worldwide fossil fuel consumption, carbon dioxide levels\nhave increased in the atmosphere with increasingly important impacts on the environment.\nRenewable and clean sources of energy have been proposed, including wind and solar, but they\nare intermittent and require efficient and scalable energy storage technologies. Electrochemical\nCO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides a valuable approach in this area. It combines solaror\nwind-generated electrical production with energy storage in the chemical bonds of carbonbased\nfuels. It can provide ways to integrate carbon capture, utilization, and storage in energy\ncycles while maintaining controlled levels of atmospheric CO2...", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Sheng Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Qun Fan, Rong Xia,Thomas J.
