{"Nomor": 46687, "Judul": "MULTIFIDELITY AND MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMISATION OF CLOSED-WING DESIGN FOR HALE-ITB UAV", "Abstrak": "This thesis discuss about the development of an optimisation framework for preliminary\ndesign of HALE-ITB UAV closed-wing design. Simplification of the\ndesign is applied by isolating the wing from its body and represent it as two individual\nwings with gaps and laps. The main objectives of this optimisation are\ndevided into 2 categories. The first one is 2D aerodynamic aspect which uses\nhigh fidelity method, and the second one is 3D aerodynamic and structural aspect\nwhich uses a low fidelity one. In 2D perspective, the objective is to maximise\nthe aerodynamic efficiency of the wing\u2019s airfoil with respect to its shape and configuration\n(12 total design variables). While in 3D aspect, the objectives are to\ndevelop the wing planform so that it maximise the aircraft flight endurance and\nstructurally efficient (10 total design variables). The optimisation is conducted for\nseveral cases within a given aerodynamic, performance, stability, and structural\nconstraints which are addressed to the HALE-ITB UAV requirements. RANSbased\nCFD is used as high fidelity solver for airfoil analysis, while combination\nof Datcom, Vortex-Lattice (VLM), and analytical structural method are used for\nlow fidelity analysis in 3D aspects. Ordinary Kriging (OK) is used to assist the\noptimisation algorithm as the surrogate model of the high fidelity data. NSGA-II\nis chosen as the optimisation algorithm to find the pareto-front of each case. In\nresult, the optimisation goals are achieved with no conflict of interest found.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Muhammad Faqih Afthon": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/204128"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Faqih Afthon [23618004]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr.-Ing.
