{"Nomor": 48135, "Judul": "WATERFLOOD OPTIMIZATION UNDER UNCERTAINTY FOR EARLY INJECTION SCHEME", "Abstrak": "Waterflood is an essential and critical part of an oilfield production lifetime. Conventional approach normally regards the injection phase as secondary recovery whose implementation occurs after the primary depletion stage. Therefore, the effect of waterflood is typically overlooked in the well placement design since it is considered as a future implementation.\nIn this study, a new paradigm is proposed in which the combination of primary recovery drainage area and early waterflood scheduling is utilized in the well placement design. Although highly eccentric and less implemented, conducting early waterflood is hypothesized to increase the drainage area of each well and consequently, reduces the number of required producer wells. A stochastic-based approach is also developed by utilizing Monte Carlo simulation to cope with possible data uncertainties and to minimize the output\u2019s uncertainty margin.\nThrough this study, early waterflood is proven to be more profitable as it yields higher recovery factor yet at fewer number of producer wells. Furthermore, reduced uncertainty margin in both the recovery factor and net present value are observed for earlier waterflood implementation.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Patrick Ivan [12216045]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Silvya Dewi Rahmawati, S.Si., M.Si., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Waterflood, data uncertainty, optimization, drainage area, recovery factor", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Jun 2020"}
