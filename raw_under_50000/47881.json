{"Nomor": 47881, "Judul": "INFLUENCES OF FULLERENE ADDITION IN EPOXY RESIN FOR HIGH VOLTAGE INSULATION ON ELECTRIC BREAKDOWN STRENGTH AND ITS DIELECTRIC PROPERTIES", "Abstrak": "The use of compact high voltage equipment has become a necessity, along with the high value\nof land for substations and the need for environmentally friendly insulation materials makes a\nsolid insulation one of the best alternatives used as insulation for high voltage equipment.\nSolid insulation materials basically have a very high electric strength, and this strength is\ndistinctly higher than the strength of liquids and gases. Solid insulation also has specific\nadvantages: High breakdown strengths (e.g. for thin films), reduced stresses due to field\ndisplacement and their applicability as mechanical construction materials. It is well known\nthat Epoxy Resin is the best insulation material in Solid Insulated Switchgear (SIS) due to its\nexcellent mechanical, electrical properties and chemical stability. In this research, the\nauthors compared four types of Epoxy resins, namely EP/C60, epoxy added with 100% C60\nfullerene as filler (EP Type A); EP/NMST, epoxy added with 60% C60 fullerene, 20% C70\nfullerene and 20% others high fullerene (EP Type B); EP/NPH, epoxy added with 40% C60\nfullerene, 40% C70 fullerene and 20% others high fullerene (EP Type C) and Neat EP, epoxy\nwithout adding fullerene as a filler (EP Type D). EP/C60, EP/NMST and EP/NPH has same\ncontent of filler, that is 0.22 %wt. The dielectric strength and the dielectric spectroscopy\nmeasurement were performed to analyzed the influences of epoxy resin impurities with\nfulerene addition in its dielectric strength and dielectric properties of epoxy resin. The results\nof AC breakdown measurement show that dielectric strength electrical breakdown of EP/C60,\nEP/NMST, and EP/NPH increased by 33 %, 32 % and 30 %. The dielectric spectroscopy\nmeasurement show that the impurities of epoxy resin with fullerene increased the dielectric\nconstant and decreased the dielectric loss factor of epoxy composites. Quantum Chemical\nCalculation (QCC) was also performed using GausView 5.9 software to analyze the electron\nenergy state for explaining the improvement of electrical breakdown by adding different kinds\nof fullerene to epoxy resin. The QCC results show that the addition of fullerene to epoxy resin\ncan increase the electronegativity of epoxy resin from 1.44 to 3.66 eV. The increase in\nelectronegativity of epoxy resin is more likely to allow epoxy resins to capture free electrons,\nresulting in the increase in the dielectric strength. compared to that of Neat EP,\nrespectively.", "Daftar File": {"Abstract": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/207436", "ABSTRAK Kristiawan Agung Satria": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/207548"}, "Penulis": "Kristiawan Agung Satria [23218052]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
