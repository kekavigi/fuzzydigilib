{"Nomor": 48109, "Judul": "COMPARISON BETWEEN HYDRAULIC FRACTURING AND HORIZONTAL WELL IN THINLY BEDDED TIGHT RESERVOIR", "Abstrak": "This study was conducted by compare two methods which used to optimizing oil production from thinly bedded reservoir with tight permeability, which would give the largest net present value (NPV). Hydraulic fracturing and horizontal well are designed by considering reservoir characteristic and the size of well spacing. This analysis is also complemented with sensitivity of treatment size in hydraulic fracturing and the length of horizontal section in horizontal well. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the reservoir thickness so these two method can be selected based on reservoir thickness which will give the largest NPV. The result of this study show that in reservoir with thin layer, it will be more profitable using horizontal well, and will be discussed later.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hidayat Handarianto [12216022]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Amega Yasutra, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Hydraulic fracturing, horizontal well, thinly bedded reservoir, tight permeability, net present value", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Jun 2020"}
