{"Nomor": 41553, "Judul": "Privacy-preserving and accountable on-the-road prosecution of invalid vehicular mandatory authorizations", "Abstrak": "Nowadays, improving road safety is one of the major challenges in developed countries\nand, to this regard, attaining more effectiveness in the enforcement of road safety policies\nhas become a key target. In particular, enforcing the requirements related to the technical\nand administrative mandatory documentation of on-the-road motor vehicles is one of the\ncritical issues. The use of modern technologies in the context of Intelligent Transportation\nSystems (ITS) could enable the design of a more convenient, frequent and effective enforcement\nsystem compared to the traditional human patrol controls. In this article we propose\na novel system for the on-the-fly verification of mandatory technical and administrative\ndocumentation of motor vehicles. Vehicles not complying with the required regulations\nwill be identified and sanctioned whereas those vehicles, observant of the mandatory regulations,\nwill maintain anonymity and non-traceability of their whereabouts. The proposed\nsystem is based on the use of anonymous credentials which will be loaded onto the vehicle\nto automatically and on-the-fly prove holdership of required credentials without requiring\nthe vehicle to stop beside the road. We also implement a prototype of the credential system\nand analyze the feasibility of our solution in terms of computational cost and time to perform\nsuch telematic controls.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "A.I.
