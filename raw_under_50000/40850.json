{"Nomor": 40850, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT OF EXPERIMENTAL METHODS FOR IMPACT TESTING BY COMBINING HOPKINSON PRESSURE BARWITH OTHER TECHNIQUES", "Abstrak": "The split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) technique and the wave propagation in-\nverse analysis (WPIA) technique are both extensively used to experimentally investigate the im-\npact behavior of materials, although neither of them alone provides a fully satisfactory analysis. In\nthe present paper, attention is given to new experimental techniques by incorporating a damage-\nmodified constitutive model into the SHPB technique and combining the Hopkinson pressure bar\n(HPB) technique with WPIA. First, to distinguish the response due to dynamic constitutive be-\nhavior and the response due to dynamic damage evolution, the SHPB method incorporating a\ndamage-modified constitutive model is developed, including an explicit damage-modified Zhu\u2013\nWang\u2013Tang model and an implicit damage-modified constitutive model. Second, when the SHPB\nresults become invalid, a method of combining new Lagrange inverse analyses with the HPB tech-\nnique is developed, including cases of the HPB arranged in front of a long specimen and behind\nthe specimen. As examples of these new methods, typical results are given for nonlinear viscoelas-\ntic polymers and concretes considering damage evolution, a super-elastic Ti\u2013Ni alloy with phase\ntransformation and an aluminum foam with shock waves propagating within it.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lili Wang  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Shisheng Hu, Liming Yang Zijian Sun, Jue Zhu, Huawei Lai, Yuanyuan Ding"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Hopkinson pressure bar, SHPB, Lagrangian analysis, high strain rate, rate-dependent constitutive relation, damage evolution", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 27, No. 4, August, 2014", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "16 Jul 2019"}
