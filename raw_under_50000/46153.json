{"Nomor": 46153, "Judul": "ORGANOCATALYTIC ASYMMETRIC SYNTHESIS OF INDOLE-BASED CHIRAL HETEROCYCLES: STRATEGIES, REACTIONS, AND OUTREACH", "Abstrak": "Indole-based chiral heterocycles constitute a class of important heterocyclic compounds that are found in\nnumerous pharmaceuticals, functional materials, and chiral catalysts or ligands. Catalytic asymmetric synthesis, for which the 2001 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded, has been demonstrated to be the most efficient method for accessing chiral compounds. Therefore, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of indole-based chiral heterocycles has attracted great interest from the scientific community. However, the strategies toward this goal are rather limited, and great challenges remain in this field, such as metal contamination in the products, the limited number of platform molecules with versatile reactivity, and the limited number of catalytic asymmetric reactions that offer high step economy, atom economy, and excellent enantiocontrol. Therefore, novel strategies for the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of indole-based chiral heterocycles are urgently needed....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yu-Chen Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Fei Jiang, Feng Shi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Organocatalytic Asymmetric Synthesis, Indole-Based Chiral Heterocycles", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Feb 2020"}
