{"Nomor": 46182, "Judul": "FACILE STRATEGY TO SYNTHESIZE MAGNETIC UPCONVERSION NANOSCALE METAL?ORGANIC FRAMEWORK COMPOSITES FOR THERANOSTICS APPLICATION", "Abstrak": "Recently, the design of a theranostics system has involved\nincreasing attention in the area of biomedical applications. In many cases,\nthe intricate synthesis process of upconversion nanoparticle-based\ncomposite materials limits the use of theranostics applications. To address\nthis challenge, a nanocomposite has been successfully fabricated by the\nconjugation of magnetic NaGdF4:Yb/Er nanoparticles as an imaging agent\nand MIL-53(Fe) as a drug carrier through a single step. Simultaneously,\nfolic acid is encapsulated on the surface of the nanocomposite by\nconjugation chemistry to achieve the targeted drug delivery applications.\nThe synthesized nanocomposite exhibits a sufficient amount of loading\nability toward the model anticancer doxorubicin and possesses pHresponsive\ndrug release. The functionalized nanocomposite not only\npossesses excellent colloidal stability and good magnetic and fluorescence property but also shows superior biocompatibility, strong tumor cell growth inhibitory effect, and cancer-enhanced cellular uptake. It is expected that the synthesized nanocomposite can also serve as a platform for both T1 and T2 MRI contrast agents.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Poulami Mukherjee [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Amit Kumar, Keerti Bhamidipati, Nagaprasad Puvvada, and Sumanta Kumar Sahu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "drug delivery, folic acid, nanocomposite, NMOFs, upconversion nanoparticle", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Feb 2020"}
