{"Nomor": 42079, "Judul": "THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION IN DEVELOPING ENTREPRENEURIAL GRADUATES WITHIN A UNIVERSITY CONTEXT", "Abstrak": "The importance of entrepreneurship education that positively impacts on the\ncreation of new ventures has been widely recognized. Despite numerous studies\nconducted to evaluate the effectiveness of entrepreneurship education within a\nuniversity setting, the results are mostly fragmented. Most studies are focused on\nthe unsystematic approach to entrepreneurship education that partially\nincorporates curriculum, certain pedagogy, institutional support, and assessment.\nThis research thus proposes a systematic approach to evaluate the\nentrepreneurship education. The evaluation uses a systematic framework as\nguidelines for attaining effective learning and understanding priorities of key\nstakeholders within a university to develop entrepreneurial graduates. A\nsystematic framework is a well-organized basic structure of concepts and\npractices that constitutes a way of viewing reality, showing a comprehensive\nassemblage of principles in entrepreneurship education regarding student, staff,\nand institution aspect. This research explores the existing learning practices within\nseveral universities, namely: School of Business and Management (SBM)-\nBandung Institute of Technology (ITB), Telkom Institute of Management (IM\nTelkom), Prasetiya Mulya Business School (PMBS), and Ciputra University\n(UC).\nThis research uses case study method and has been carried out in two stages. The\nfirst stage is descriptive phase. Here the research will focus on mapping of\nexisting learning and institutional supports within a university context. Data\nexploration regarding learning process within a university such as curriculum,\ninstitutional supports, pedagogy, assessment, and Assurance of Learning (AoL)\nwill be evaluated from internal perspective such as faculty members and external\nperspectives such as alumni in order to get better understanding of learning\nexperiences that support to become entrepreneurial graduates. The second stage is\nevaluative phase, this stage lead to develop theory which effective to supports\nstudents in becoming entrepreneurial graduates.\nii\nThe four cases of SBM-ITB, IM Telkom, PMBS, and UC are divided into two\ncategories of cases, namely positive case and negative case. The positive case in\nthis research is the three cases of SBM-ITB, PMBS, and UC. They are well\nmanaged the aspects that support the effectiveness of entrepreneurship education.\nThe best learning practices from these three cases are as practical guidelines for\nother business schools to create the effective learning. The opportunities areas to\nbe improved (below the average level) are workload (only SBM-ITB that has high\nscore in this aspect), rewards for lecturer, and AoL aspect (only PMBS that has\nhigh score in this aspect). The negative case of IM Telkom has the effectiveness\nlevel below the average. There are several opportunities to make a better\nimprovement in the field entrepreneurship education. The opportunities area to be\nimproved (below average level) are recruitment and selection of student,\ncurriculum, institutional support, teaching method, participation, rewards for\nstudent, pay and safety needs, performance appraisal, workload, knowledge\nsharing, rewards for lecturer, and AoL aspect.\nBeside a systematic framework development of entrepreneurship education, this\nresearch is contributed to the development of criteria for learning effectiveness.\nThese criteria are used to determine the extent of learning effectiveness from the\nfour cases. The synthesis from cross-case analysis formulates the effective\nlearning theory that covering aspects of student, staff, institution, and AoL to\nsupport students in becoming entrepreneurial graduates.", "Daftar File": {"COVER ASTRI GHINA.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180983", "CHAPTER I ASTRI GHINA.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180984", "CHAPTER II ASTRI GHINA.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180985", "CHAPTER III ASTRI GHINA.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180986", "CHAPTER IV ASTRI GHINA.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180987", "CHAPTER V ASTRI GHINA.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180988", "CHAPTER VI ASTRI GHINA.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180989", "CHAPTER VII ASTRI GHINA.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180990", "CHAPTER VIII ASTRI GHINA.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180991", "CHAPTER IX ASTRI GHINA.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180992", "CHAPTER X ASTRI GHINA.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180993", "CHAPTER XI ASTRI GHINA.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180994", "REFERENCES  ASTRI GHINA.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180996"}, "Penulis": "Astri Ghina [39011005]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
