Many alternative and more responsible\ntourism have been created for this problem, as in the case of this research, which\nfocuses on ecotourism, which is one of the many types of responsible tourism that is\nmore concerned with the environment and the surrounding community. Different\ndefinitions associated with ecotourism are evoked during this research which are both\nmore relevant. Besides, ecotourism is the association of tourism to the environment\nand cultural exchange in accordance with the policies in the areas concerned which\nmakes it a form of sustainable tourism. This research then requires an understanding\nof the characteristics, ecotourism principles and policies that go with the conservation\nof nature. In order to establish and achieve the expected results, two National Parks of\ntwo different countries, Mount Ciremai National Park for Indonesia and Andasibe\nMantadia Park for Madagascar, will be highlighted using a comparative method.\nTo collect the necessary data, surveys on national park sites would be made for\nobservations, interviews and documentation, and data from previous works on all\naspects of this research are collected. These data will therefore be used during the\nqualitative approach and the comparative analysis of the two parks in this research.\nThe data collection will focus on the ecotourism characteristics and the present\nprinciples in the parks, and the environmental policies applied in their field of\nexploitation. This research could lead to applicable theories for the development of\necotourism in Mount Ciremai and Andasibe Mantadia National Parks, and could also\nprove that ecotourism is a revolutionary type of tourism for the conservation and\nsustainable prosperity of natural areas exploited so that the next generation can benefit.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Rakotonindrina Onjaharimanana": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/182930", "BAB 1 Rakotonindrina Onjaharimanana": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/182931", "BAB 2 Rakotonindrina Onjaharimanana": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/182932", "BAB 3 Rakotonindrina Onjaharimanana": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/182933", "BAB 4 Rakotonindrina Onjaharimanana": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/182934", "BAB 5 Rakotonindrina Onjaharimanana": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/182935", "BAB 6 Rakotonindrina Onjaharimanana": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/182936", "DAFTAR Rakotonindrina Onjaharimanana": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/182937"}, "Penulis": "Rakotonindrina Onjaharimanana [95716701]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
