{"Nomor": 46084, "Judul": "FUNDAMENT AND APPLICATION OF GRAPHDIYNE IN ELECTROCHEMICAL ENERGY", "Abstrak": "The artificial synthesis of graphdiyne (GDY) in 2010\nsuccessfully fills the blank of low temperature preparation of all-carbon\nallotropes. GDY is an emerging two-dimensional (2D) planar carbon material\ncomposed of benzene rings moieties (sp2 carbon atoms), butadiyne (sp carbon\natoms) linkers, and well dispersed electron-rich cavities, forming a large ?-\nconjunction structure. GDY has attracted increasing attention in many fields.\nGDY is the first carbon material with both 2D fast transfer channels for\nelectrons and 3D channels for ions. The 2D electron-rich all-carbon nature\nendows GDY with considerable conductivity and tunable electronic properties,\nand the in-plane cavities give it intrinsic selectivity and accessibility for\nelectrochemically active metal ions. In addition, its easy preparation under mild\nconditions well complements the disadvantages of the traditional sp2-hybridized\ncarbon materials (carbon nanotubes, graphene, and graphite) in the highly\nefficient synthesis and processing for potential electrochemical applications.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yuncheng Du [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Weidong Zhou, Jian Gao, Xiangyu Pan, and Yuliang Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Application of Graphdiyne, Electrochemical Energy", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Feb 2020"}
