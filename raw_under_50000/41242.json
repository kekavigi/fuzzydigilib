{"Nomor": 41242, "Judul": "ADHESION STRENGTH AND MORPHOLOGIES OF rBMSCs DURING INITIAL ADHESION AND SPREADING", "Abstrak": "Cell adhesion plays an important role in cell physiology. A better understanding\nof this process could facilitate many clinical therapies. In this study, Rat bone marrow-derived\nmesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs) were cultured on glass substrate, and the morphology and\nadhesion strength were characterized. The cell morphology was defined as spherical, adhesive,\nand spreading. The adhesion strengths of the different morphologies exhibited different distribu-\ntion patterns. The spherical cells exhibited low adhesion strength; the adhesive cells exhibited\nrapidly increasing adhesion strength while their diameters remained relatively constant. The ad-\nhesion strength increased with the cell diameter in the spreading cells. These findings suggest\nthat adhesion strength can be quickly assessed by examining the cell morphology.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Haosen Wang  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zhixiu Hao, Shizhu Wen"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "cell adhesion, micropipette aspiration, cell morphology, pseudopodia", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 5, October, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan \u00a0\n                                     Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Agu 2019"}
