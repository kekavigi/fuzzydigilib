{"Nomor": 46137, "Judul": "REACTIVITY-BASED ORGANIC THERANOSTIC BIOPROBES", "Abstrak": "Reactivity-based organic bioprobes have\nbeen increasingly designed and developed in the last couple of\nyears to address important questions in numerous fields,\nparticularly in biology and medicine. Contrary to the\nconventional lock-and-key bioprobes, which rely on molecular\nrecognition to probe biological systems and impart sensing\nspecificity, reactivity-based bioprobes capitalize on molecular\nreactivity for selective target detection. In fact, reactivity-based sensing exploits the intrinsic differences in chemical reactivity to differentiate various chemical species possessing similar size and shape in biological systems.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Kenry [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Kok Chan Chong, Bin Liu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Based Organic Theranostic Bioprobes", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Feb 2020"}
