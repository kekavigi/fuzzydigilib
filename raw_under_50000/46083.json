Inspiration for the project can be traced all the way back to\nthe graduate career of the corresponding author, wherein the analogy between a [C?H?\nC]+ \u201chydrido\u201d bridge and a hypothetical [C?F?C]+ bridge was first noted. The earliest\nattempt to construct a bicyclo[5.3.3]tridecane-based fluoronium ion (based on the\nanalogous hydrido bridged cation) proved to be synthetically difficult. A subsequent\nattempt involving a 1,8-substituted naphthalene ring was theoretically naiv? e in retrospect ....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Maxwell Gargiulo Holl [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Cody Ross Pitts and Thomas Lectka"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Symmetric [C?F?C]+", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan \u00a0\n                                     Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Feb 2020"}
