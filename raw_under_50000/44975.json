{"Nomor": 44975, "Judul": "Reconstruction-Free Quantum Sensing of Arbitrary Waveforms", "Abstrak": "We present a protocol for directly detecting time-dependent magnetic field waveforms with a quantum\ntwo-level system. Our method is based on a differential refocusing of segments of the waveform using spin\nechoes. The sequence can be repeated to increase the sensitivity to small signals. The frequency bandwidth is intrinsically limited by the duration of the refocusing pulses. We demonstrate detection of arbitrary waveforms with approximately 20 ns time resolution and approximately 4 ?T/? Hz field sensitivity using the electronic spin of a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "J. Zopes [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["C.L.
