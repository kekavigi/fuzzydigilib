{"Nomor": 49034, "Judul": "APPLICATION OF ELECTROCHEMICAL IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY TO INVESTIGATE THE CHARACTERIZATION OF MILK WHEN ULTRAVIOLET (UV) RAYS RADIATE ON IT", "Abstrak": "The objective of this study was to investigate the characterization of milk when ultraviolet light is exposed on it, by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a technique that probes energy storage and dissipation properties over a range of frequencies by measuring impedance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) plays an important role in many fields of science and technology, such as electrochemistry, Physics, electrochemical engineering, material science, biology and medicine. In this study the impedance analyzer AD5933 has been used to determine the impedance characterization of milk fills in beaker up to 100ml in frequencies intervals between 5Khz to 90Khz.The impedance of milk before UV exposed on it was measured. After measuring impedance, the UV of wavelength of 254 nm was exposed to the beaker, contains milk up to 100ml in the frequencies intervals between 5Khz to 90Khz and impedance was measured. The real part and imaginary part of impedance before and after UV exposed on milk have been plotted versus frequency, the real part and imaginary part increased according to the frequency increased. The Nyquist plots before and after UV exposed to the milk have been plotted and the plots coincided. The result shows that, there is no effect of UV to the impedance of milk because milk is an opaque food so, the UV light cannot penetrate in milk easily.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Jean Pierre NDAYIRAGIJE": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/209291", "BAB 1 Jean Pierre NDAYIRAGIJE": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/209292", "BAB 2 Jean Pierre NDAYIRAGIJE": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/209293", "BAB 3 Jean Pierre NDAYIRAGIJE": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/209294", "BAB 4 Jean Pierre NDAYIRAGIJE": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/209295", "BAB 5 Jean Pierre NDAYIRAGIJE": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/209296", "PUSTAKA Jean Pierre NDAYIRAGIJE": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/209297"}, "Penulis": "Jean Pierre NDAYIRAGIJE [20218701]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Hendro, MS", "Irfan Dwi Aditya, S.Si., M.Si."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), milk, ultraviolet radiation, AD5933.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Agu 2020"}
