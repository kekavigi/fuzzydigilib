{"Nomor": 40900, "Judul": "The regeneration capacity of an earthworm, Eisenia fetida, in relation to the site of amputation along the body", "Abstrak": "It is well known that parts of earthworms can survive if they are cut off. Our aim was to link the regeneration\ncapacity of an earthworm, Eisenia fetida (Oligochaeta, Annelida) with the site of the amputation,\nso we amputated earthworms at different body segment locations along the length of the body to examine\nthe different survival rates and regeneration lengths of the anterior, posterior, and medial sections.\nThe greatest survival rates occurred for earthworms with the most body segments remaining after\namputation. The anterior regeneration lengths were of two types. The lengths of regeneration of amputated\nfrom body segment 6/7 to further down the body posteriorly increased gradually (Type LI). However,\nthe regeneration lengths of earthworm which were amputated behind the 23rd segment, with\nless than a quarter of the total segments remaining, did not increase until the blastema and tail bud formation\n(Type LII). These treatments were not completely regeneration. There were significant differences\nin both survival rates and lengths of regeneration lengths between immature earthworms and clitellate\nadult earthworms during the early stages of regeneration, but not at later stages of regeneration. The\nimmature earthworms had a greater regeneration potential than clitellate adults amputated at the same\nsegment. The survival rates of earthworms were correlated significantly with the number of body segments\nremaining after amputation, but not with the position of the amputation. The relationships\nbetween the survival rates and the numbers of remaining segments could be described by linear regressions.\nThe anterior regeneration lengths were correlated with the position of the amputation, but not\nwith the number of remaining segments; the posterior regeneration lengths, were not correlated with\nthe number of segments remaining nor the amputation position. The anterior regeneration length was\nnot related to the survival rates for all earthworm amputations after 30 days but was related in this\nway after 60 days.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Nengwen Xiao  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Feng Ge, Clive A.
