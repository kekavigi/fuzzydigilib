The constitutive relation of carbon nanotube on micro-scale is founded using the non-\nlocal elastic theory. The governing equation on micro-scale is obtained. And the first five orders of\nthe natural frequency of the carbon nanotube conveying fluid with various speeds are calculated\nthrough the wave method. Besides, the critical flow velocity when the carbon nanotube loses\nstability is obtained. Meanwhile, a contrast is made between the result obtained through the\nwave method and that in previous researches.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zijun Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yong shou Liu, Baohui Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "wave method, non-local elastic theory, natural frequency, critical flow velocity", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Jul 2019"}
