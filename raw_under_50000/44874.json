{"Nomor": 44874, "Judul": "Preparation Of An Environmentally Friendly Emulsion-Type Lubricant Based On Crude Rice Bran Wax", "Abstrak": "In this study, crude rice bran wax oil - in - water emulsion (named CRBWE) was prepared by agent-in-water\nmethod. The critical factors influencing the sample preparation process were optimized. For instance, the optimum hydrophile-lipophile balance value of compound emulsifier was 12.33\u201313.40, the content of compound\nemulsifier was 10 wt%, the emulsification temperature was 70 \u00b0C\u201380 \u00b0C, the agitation speed was 200 rpm, and\nthe emulsification time was 30\u201345 min. The performances as a lubricant of drilling fluid were also evaluated\nwith respect to lubricity, rheology and filtration loss of CRBWE. The results showed that CRBWE had good\nlubricity and didn't affect the rheological properties of drilling fluid. For example, when it was added into\nbentonite dispersion at room temperature with the fraction of 1 wt%, the coefficient of friction of bentonite\ndispersion dramatically decreased to 0.077, and the coefficient of friction reduced rate was greater than 80%.\nOverall, these findings indicated that CRBWE would have promising applications as environmental friendly\nlubricant of drilling fluids to reduce torque and drag in petroleum and natural gas drilling.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ZHENGQIANG XIONG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Fan Fu", "Xiaodong Li", "Yanning Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Emulsion-type lubricantm Crude rice bran waxm Lubricitym Biodegradablem Water-based drilling fluids", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 5, Issue 1, Pages 67-76 (March  2019), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.09.002", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Nov 2019"}
