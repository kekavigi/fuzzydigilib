{"Nomor": 46109, "Judul": "CHEMICAL TOOLS WITH FLUORESCENCE SWITCHES FOR VERIFYING EPIGENETIC MODIFICATIONS", "Abstrak": "Epigenetic DNA and histone modifications\nalter chromatin conformation and regulate gene expression. A\nmajor DNA modification is methylation, which is catalyzed by\nDNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) and results in gene\nsuppression. Compared to DNA, histones undergo a greater\nvariety of modification types, one of which is the acetylation\nof lysine. While histone acetyltransferase (HAT) catalyzes\nacetylation and activates gene expression, histone deacetylase\n(HDAC) removes the modification and causes gene\nsuppression. As precise regulation of these epigenetic marks\non DNA and histones is critical for cellular functions, their\ndysregulation causes various diseases including cancer,...", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yuichiro Hori [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Kazuya Kikuchi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Chemical Tools, Fluorescence Switches, Verifying Epigenetic Modifications", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Feb 2020"}
