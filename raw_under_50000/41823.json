Improving transmigrants' welfare and the\npeople living surroundings; (2). Improving and balancing regional\ndevelopment; and (3). Strengthening nation's unity and entity.\nSince the colonization period and during the implementation of\ntransmigration program, there are, however, no appropriate systems\nand standard evaluation on transmigration development available\nwhich are capable to measure its outcomes.\nThrough some review upon of input-process- output (I-P-0) of\neach phase of transmigration development these are 4 parameters,\n15 sub-parameters and 24 indicators of successful transmigration\ndevelopment. Those are later on managed in a hierarchy. Structure,\nand their standard norms and values will be stand and for\ndetermined based on research data, so data analysis with the\nAnalytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is available to be applied.\nFrom same cases found is this study shows that out of 8\nTransmigration Settlement Units (TSUs) spread out in 4 provinces,\nthree of them are considered to be very successful, 4 TSUs quite\nsuccessful and the rest one is considered to be fail.\nIf the method mentioned above would be applied, the benchmark\nof the succesful transmigration development is not the achievment\nof quantity of people resettled anymore, but the quantity and\nquality outcome in the whole.", "Daftar File": {"COVER.pdf?_": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180178", "BAB 1.pdf?_": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180179", "BAB 2.pdf?_": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180180", "BAB 3.pdf?_": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180181", "BAB 4.pdf?_": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180182", "BAB 5.pdf?_": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180183", "BAB 6.pdf?_": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180184", "BBA 7.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180185", "Bab 8.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180186", "PUSTAKA Sugiarto Sumas": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180187", "LAMPIRAN.pdf??_": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180188"}, "Penulis": "Sugiarto Sumas [25596023]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Studi Pembangunan", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Arsitektur, Perencanaan dan Pengembangan Kebijakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "sarnya", "File": "11 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Sep 2019"}
