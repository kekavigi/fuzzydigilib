{"Nomor": 47431, "Judul": "AUTOMATED COMPUTER-AIDED STENOSIS DETECTION AT CORONARY CT ANGIOGRAPHY: INITIAL EXPERIENCE", "Abstrak": "To evaluate the performance of a computer-aided algorithm for automated stenosis detection at coronary CT angiography (cCTA). Methods: We investigated 59 patients (38 men, mean age 58\u00b112 years) who underwent cCTA and quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). All cCTA data sets were analyzed using a software algorithm for automated, without human interaction, detection of coronary artery stenosis. The performance of the algorithm for detection of stenosis of 50% or more was compared with QCA. Results: QCA revealed a total of 38 stenoses of 50% or more of which the algorithm correctly", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Elisabeth Arnoldi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mulugeta Gebregziabher, U.
