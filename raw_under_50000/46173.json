{"Nomor": 46173, "Judul": "GALACTOXYLOGLUCAN ENDOWED BIOGENIC NANOIMMUNOBIOTICS ARRESTS MICROBIAL GROWTH AND ELICITS ANTITUMOR IMMUNITY", "Abstrak": "A straightforward investigation with a surfactant-free green\nmethod mediated orchestration of a nanocomposite, where immunotherapy\nwas fused with antimicrobial ability in a biogenic amalgamation,\nresulted in a nanoimmunobiotics (NIB). Consequently, a galactoxyloglucan\n(PST001) isolated from Tamarindus indica seed kernel was utilized in\na sustainable approach to endow copper nanoparticles (CuNP@PST) with\nhigh stability and broad pH tolerance. The biocompatible nature of the\nCuNP@PST was demonstrated by toxicity studies on BALB/c mice. The\nnanoparticles exhibited immunomodulatory features by stimulating both\nhumoral and cell-mediated immunity. As remarkable aftermath, we observed promising wound healing capacity on normal human keratinocytes along with the excellent antibacterial and antifungal activity by the NIB. The unique potential of CuNP@PST as a chemopreventive agent by eliciting antitumor immunity was illustrated on syngeneic murine tumor models. The outstanding capacity to reduce tumor burden with a significant increase in lifespan and a peculiar cytokine activation pattern could materialize these nanoparticles as an adjuvant for cancer management. The intrinsically bioeliminable, well-tolerated, and systemically available NIB promises to enter clinical testing as an antimicrobial-immunotherapy agent. Appreciable biodistribution pattern, along with the cost-effective fabrication strategies for scale-up, presents a futuristic biomedical scenario for fast promoting the translational potential of our NIB to combat antibiotic resistance and neoplasia effectively.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Manu M.
