{"Nomor": 44934, "Judul": "Transition to bound states for bacteria swimming near surfaces", "Abstrak": "It is well known that flagellated bacteria swim in circles near surfaces. However, recent experiments have\nshown that a sulfide-oxidizing bacterium named Thiovulum majus can transition from swimming in circles to a\nsurface bound state where it stops swimming while remaining free to move laterally along the surface. In this\nbound state, the cell rotates perpendicular to the surface with its flagella pointing away from it. Using numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the existence of a fluid-structure interaction instability that causes cells with relatively short flagella to become surface bound.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Debasish Das [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Eric Lauga"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW E 100, 043117 (2019), APS", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Nov 2019"}
