{"Nomor": 41020, "Judul": "BLUNT CRACK-TIP ELASTOPLASTIC ZONE OF MIXEDMODE FRACTURE", "Abstrak": "This article discusses the characterization of fracture process zone at the tip of\na blunt crack in elastoplastic materials under mixed mode loading. The analysis includes the\ndescription of elastoplastic zone geometry around the blunt crack tip for predicting crack growth\ndirection. The deformed zone appearing at the crack front is described by presenting a criterion\nbased on the subloading surface concept falling within the framework of unconventional plasticity.\nThe mixed mode crack propagates along the minimumvalue of the elastoplastic region. The present\nsolutions are reduced to those previously reported in literature, when the elastic perfectly plastic\nmaterial is considered.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mehdi Kho jastehpour [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "crack, fracture, elastic plastic materials, stress concentration", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Jul 2019"}
