The\nmaterial properties are considered to be temperature-dependent. Based on the K\u00b4arm\u00b4an-Donnell\u2019s\nnonlinear shell theory, the kinetic and potential energy of FG cylindrical thin shells are formulated.\nThe primary target is to investigate the two-mode internal resonance, which is triggered\nby geometric and material parameters of shells. Following a secular perturbation procedure, the\nunderlying dynamic characteristics of the two-mode interactions in both exact and near resonance\ncases are fully discussed. It is revealed that the system will undergo a bifurcation in near resonance\ncase, which induces the dynamic response at high energy level being distinct from the motion at\nlow energy level. The effects of temperature and volume fractions of composition on the exact\nresonance condition and bifurcation characteristics of FG cylindrical shells are also investigated.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Changcheng Du [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yinghui Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "functionally graded material, cylindrical shells, nonlinear vibration, internal resonance, Hamiltonian dynamics", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Jul 2019"}
