{"Nomor": 40919, "Judul": "Effect of annual variation in soil pH on available soil nutrients in pear orchards", "Abstrak": "Soil pH is an important factor affecting the availability of soil nutrients that impact plant growth. Given\nthe susceptibility of soil pH to excessive fertilization and the widespread use of manures, it is essential to\nexamine the influence of soil pH on the distribution and availability of soil nutrients. We sampled and\nanalyzed brown soils from pear orchards in thirteen towns in Wendeng county. Samples were obtained\nfrom areas along or between rows of trees at specified distances and depths. The results showed that the\nsoil pH fluctuated from 4.06 to 6.59 in October 2008 and from 4.24 to 7.57 in April 2009.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jing Zhao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yan Dong, Xingbin Xie, Xin Li, Xianxian Zhang, Xiang Shen"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Annual variation, Soil pH, Available soil nutrients", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Jul 2019"}
