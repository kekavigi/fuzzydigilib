{"Nomor": 45293, "Judul": "DEVELOPING A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK OF ISLAND ENTREPRENEURS IN INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "Research on small industries is a very attractive theme for researchers today. However, the\ncontext of the islands is often missing from attention, even though there are thousands of small\nislands in the world, such as Indonesia, which consists of more than 17,500 islands, which to\nsome extent, requires a different development approach with all the faced problems. The\ncompetitiveness index of Asia Competitiveness Institute 2015 indicates that island provinces,\nsuch as Bangka Belitung Island, Riau Islands, Nusa Tenggara Barat, Nusa Tenggara Timur,\nNorth Sulawesi, Maluku, North Maluku, and Southeast Sulawesi, need specific development\nstrategies since they cannot be equated with the mainlands, such as Java and Sumatera, because\ntheir competitiveness rank is averagely low. The island entrepreneurs do not only face day to day\ndeficiencies, but also to some extent, \u201ccomparative disadvantage.\u201d That is why studying island\nentrepreneurs is essential, especially for an emerging country such as Indonesia, where impartial\ndevelopment is still a big issue. On the other hand, Indonesian Legal Law no.3/2014 regarding\nIndustry instructed both Central and Local Government to realize the small and medium\nindustries' competitiveness. Hence, this study revealed what strategies are suitable for developing\nentrepreneurship on the island as well as mapping out the main impediments that are the most\nchallenging faced by island entrepreneurs.\nThis research applies a mixed-methods approach and uses deductive and inductive reasoning\nbecause the mindset and the constructs are developed through literature review from previous\nstudies as well as the in-depth interview results. The strategy for this research is the case study\nand survey. While the case study was conducted in the successful small manufacturing marine\nfood industry in Bangka Belitung Island province, supplemented with small crafter firm and\nsmall agroindustry, specifically to explore knowledge management (KM) for a small firm on the\nisland; meanwhile, the survey involved small-medium industry and government apparatuses in\neight islands provinces in Indonesia.\nThere are nine propositions constructed through literature review, which are then examined in\nthis study through an in-depth interview. Then a factor analysis is carried out on the empirical\nfindings from the interviews to get confirmation from the more significant respondents' of eight\nisland provinces in Indonesia as well as to parsimony the empirical findings. Impediments\nsurveys are carried out in stages, starting with the tabulation of impediments that are often faced\nby small firms, reducing it into 12 top impediments and then being re-surveyed on more\nsignificant respondents from the eight island provinces in Indonesia both from the perspective of\nthe government and the island entrepreneur itself.\nAs the results, there are 18 \u201chave-to-do-lists\u201d for the island entrepreneurs that are expected to\nbecome the incentive for small firms and the government in the effort to develop and strengthen\nthe small firms in the island region. From the top 12 impediments based on the perceptions of\nboth parties, is that there are eight impediments which have similarities with respect to each\nviewpoint even though the priority of scale is quite different and later becomes common ground.\nAlso, there are eight impediments regarding which both parties have different views; this means\nthat each party does not see what the other party perceives as their primary problem, and later\nthis becomes a barrier to and challenge for the survival and thriving of island entrepreneurs.\nThen, the results of the two studies above, plus some normative sources, become the basis in\ndeveloping a logic model regarding Island SMIs impediments and possible incremental\nsolutions. Regarding KM practice for small firms on the island, through an in-depth interview\nwith 12 small firms on the island, this research made effort to compile a theory building and\ncontributed to two things, i.e. how to construct an affordable knowledge management system for\nsmall firms (emphasized on culture development), especially in the small island region, and\nwhen is the veracious time for the island entrepreneurs to innovate as a part of proactive action in\nbusiness. Finally, the results of the factor analysis simplify the empirical findings into six new\nfactors only that can generate competitive advantages for island entrepreneurs.\nThis research aims to build a model of successful small firms on the island in order to provide\ninsight for many stakeholders involved in the development of small industries on the island. The\nresults of this study are expected to pave the way for the development and spread of small\nindustries throughout Indonesia in order to achieve equitable development in this country.\nSimultaneously, through this research, it is expected that the awareness of researchers and related\nstakeholders to the context of the Island will increase. Lastly, the results of this study also might\nbring implications for further research, for example, to find out which factors (prudence,\nobedience, so-island, independent, cash in hand, and practical) are the most influential on the\ncompetitiveness of the island entrepreneurship, provided with related research to the sociology of\nsmall island societies will be a promising and useful future inquiries.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Muslim El Hakim Kurniawan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/190576"}, "Penulis": "Muslim El Hakim Kurniawan [39016009]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
