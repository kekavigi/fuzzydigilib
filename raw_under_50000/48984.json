{"Nomor": 48984, "Judul": "A PROGRAM FOR QUICK SIMULATION OF SURFACTANT FLOODING PERFORMANCE", "Abstrak": "Several tertiary recovery methods are used to maximize production in oil reservoir. Due to the effectiveness of surfactant as an oil recovery agent, surfactant has been used for increasing recovery factor. Surfactant flooding simulation program was developed in this study. The program is based on existing mathematical model describing one-dimensional two-phase surfactant system. Backward equation with constant grid block sizes discretization is used to obtain water saturation and surfactant concentration in each space and time step. Areal sweep efficiency correlation is used to obtain two-dimensional simulation result. Water flooding case was tested in the program and its result was compared to Buckley-Leverett model. Three type of injection cases are presented for simulation and those are: constant injection, surfactant slug at initial injection, alternating slug injection.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Daniardy Hilman Pradana": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/209123"}, "Penulis": "Daniardy Hilman Pradana [12216074]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
