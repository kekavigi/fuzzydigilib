{"Nomor": 45159, "Judul": "Gas Leakage Mechanism In Bedded Salt Rock Storage Cavern Considering Damaged Interface", "Abstrak": "During the long-time operation of salt rock storage cavern, between its formations, damaged interfaces induced by discontinuous creep deformations between adjacent layers will possibly lead to\nserious gas leakage. In this paper, damaged interfaces are considered as main potential leakage\npath: firstly in meso-level, gas flow rule along the interface is analyzed and the calculation of\nequivalent permeability is discussed. Then based on porous media seepage theory, gas leakage\nsimulation model including salt rock, cavity interlayers and interface is built. With this strategy, it is\npossible to overcome the disadvantage of simulation burden with porous-fractured double medium. It also can provide the details of gas flowing along the damaged zones. Finally this proposal is\napplied to the salt cavern in Qianjian mines (East China). Under different operation pressures, gas\ndistributions around two adjacent cavities are simulated; the evolvement of gas in the interlayers\nand salt rock is compared. From the results it is demonstrated that the domain of creep damage\narea has great influence on leakage range. And also the leakage in the interface will accelerate the\ndevelopment of leakage in salt rock. It is concluded that compared with observations, this new\nstrategy provides closer answers. The simulation result proves its validity for the design and\nreasonable control of operating pressure and tightness evaluation of group bedded salt rock storage\ncaverns", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "JUN XIONG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiaolan Huang", "Hongling Ma"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Bedded salt rock, Gas leakage, Equivalent permeability, Numerical simulation", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 4, Pages 366-372 (December  2015), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.10.008", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Nov 2019"}
