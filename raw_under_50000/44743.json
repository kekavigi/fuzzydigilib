{"Nomor": 44743, "Judul": "The Concept of Public Disclosure in Developing Environmental Regulation for Pollution Control", "Abstrak": "Sustainable development refers to the concept of intergenerational equity focusing on the needs of the present without neglecting the future needs. Furthermore, sustainable development is considered in concerning of global environmental changes that should be considered in the process of policy-making and realized in political action. Indeed, sustainable development must be the core of environmental policy, since sound environmental policies should have a capacity in response such global environmental changes. The implementation of such policies is achieved through the selection and application of the appropriate instrument. When implementing a sound environmental policy, it should be considered efficiency issues as a response of sustainability. Efficiency is aimed at preventing waste of the environment and natural resources. Moreover, there is a failure of the existing instruments of environmental policy in developing countries. A new approach that is more efficient in environmental policy is needed, whether it substitute or complement to the existing ones.\nThe public disclosure has become a new instrument that is considered as suitable alternative, since it relates to the integration of the community and market instead of only between regulators and polluters. Moreover, it supports dynamic efficiency in relation with the possibilities to encourage polluters to reduce the production of waste and to promote the cleaner production. The decreasing of waste and a potential increasing in the use of cleaner production give impacts in increasing the efficiency and quality of life.\nThis study presents the implementation of the public disclosure initiative, as a new environmental policy instrument, in developed and developing countries. The case study is undertaken on the success of Toxic Releases Inventory (TRI) in the United States and the Program for Pollution Evaluation and Rating (PROPER) in Indonesia.\nThe similarities of the public disclosure implementation in both two countries are the focus on the aspect of acting the information and the role of stakeholder involvement. In this context, those aspects are the core of the successful implementation of public disclosure. Indeed, the concern can be undertaken on providing the facilities to support the application of those aspects. Meanwhile, the differences exist mainly on the methods, the general context, and the support of the government in providing means for stakeholder participation.\nSome lessons are also analyzed from the experiences of TRI in the United States for improving the efficiency of the PROPER execution in Indonesia. Firstly, encouraging means used by stakeholders to access information. This is increasing the level of transparency in obtaining the information of the environmental management. Secondly, there is the possibility to adopt \u2018stakeholder dialogue\u2019 in TRI to encourage community participation in PROPER. Thirdly, there is the possibility to establish independence\ninstitution to monitor the implementation of PROPER. This is aimed to increase the transparency of such public disclosure initiative.\nSome recommendations were adopted in the latter section of this study. The recommendations include the improvement of legal foundation, stimulating the function of the new channels, encouraging technical support, encouraging means for access to information, and promoting socialization with a view to raising education community.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Dyah Ajuni Lukitosari": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/187711", "BAB 1 Dyah Ajuni Lukitosari": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/187712", "BAB 2 Dyah Ajuni Lukitosari": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/187713", "BAB 3 Dyah Ajuni Lukitosari": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/187714", "BAB 4 Dyah Ajuni Lukitosari": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/187715", "BAB 5 Dyah Ajuni Lukitosari": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/187716", "2008 TS PP DYAH AJUNI LUKITOSARI REFERENCES .": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/187717"}, "Penulis": "Dyah Ajuni Lukitosari [25406040]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Femke Miekerk", "Ir.
