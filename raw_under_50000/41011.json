The Paper also further discusses the driving factors of the population pattern intensity. In spring, the population primarily consisted of small patches, population aggregation was low, and individualmean crowding was the lowest of the year. In summer, population aggregation and individual mean was highest. In fall, the population\nprimarily consisted of a small number of large patches. In winter, population aggregation was the lowest. The\nzooplankton biomass (feed) and water temperature were the major factors affecting population aggregation.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jiandi Cai  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sunzhong Ye, Zhidong Zhuang, Chunyan Xu, Chao Ma, Yong Liu, Changchun Shen"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Pattern intensity, Mean crowding, Poly block index", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Jul 2019"}
