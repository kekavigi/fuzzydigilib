{"Nomor": 46140, "Judul": "CHEMICAL BIOLOGY APPROACHES TO INTERROGATE THE SELENOPROTEOME", "Abstrak": "Selenoproteins are the family of proteins\nthat contain the amino acid selenocysteine. Many selenoproteins,\nincluding glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin\nreductases, play a role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis.\nThere are a number of examples of homologues of\nselenoproteins that utilize cysteine residues, raising the\nquestion of why selenocysteines are utilized. One hypothesis\nis that incorporation of selenocysteine protects against\nirreversible overoxidation, typical of cysteine-containing\nhomologues under high oxidative stress. Studies of selenocysteine\nfunction are hampered by challenges both in detection\nand in recombinant expression of selenoproteins. In fact,\nabout half of the 25 known human selenoproteins remain\nuncharacterized.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jennifer C.
