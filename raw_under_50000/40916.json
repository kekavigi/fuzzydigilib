Annual habitat selection of\nreleased P\u00e8re David\u2019s deer was studied from November 2008 to November 2009. The results of our\nresearch showed that: in autumn and winter released P\u00e8re David\u2019s deer preferred to choose the locations\nat Spartina alterniflora community with higher plant density, higher plant height and larger aboveground\nbiomass; in spring and summer released P\u00e8re David\u2019s deer preferred to choose the locations at S. alterniflora\ncommunity with lower plant height, smaller aboveground biomass. Released P\u00e8re David\u2019s deer preferred\nto choose the locations at S. alterniflora community which are close to water sources and shallow\nbogs but have a moderate distance from the sea. Principal components analysis was performed on 8 ecological factors. The cumulative contribution of the first 3 principal components reached to 75% and these\nfactors could represent the annual habitat features of released P\u00e8re David\u2019s deer. According to the results\nof principal component analysis, the influential factors for annual habitat selection of released P\u00e8re David\u2019s\ndeer were classified separately as food factor (aboveground biomass, plant height), water factor (distance\nto water, distance from the shallow bogs), disturbance factor (distance from human disturbance).", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Wu Baolei [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ji Yifan, Wang Jinli, Qin Pei"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "P\u00e8re David\u2019s deer, Habitat selection, Spartina alterniflora", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Jul 2019"}
