{"Nomor": 41394, "Judul": "On Numerical and Experimental Study of Pipe under Low-speed Impact Loads", "Abstrak": "Pipelines risk being damaged by impacts and other types of high-speed loading\nduring operations and installations, for example, onshore pipelines are indented\naccidentally by an excavator tooth. In addition, it is very frequent that subsea pipelines\nare impacted by anchors, trawl gears and hard objects dropped from the ships. These\ndemonstrate that accidental loads caused by third party activities have posed a serious\nthreat to the pipeline integrity, which has been known as main causes of pipeline\naccidents. However, this kind of threat is predictable and preventable. The present\nstudy deals with the theoretical, numerical and experimental analyses on the impact\ncharacteristics on the structure of non-pressurized and pressurized line pipe.\nThe investigations discuss two cases of deformation in which the height of\ndropping, dent depth, impact force, internal pressure and geometry of pipe are main\nvariables. In drop-test simulations, the pipes (Mild Steel and Aluminum) were clamped\nand indented by conical and prismatic nose shape indenters alternatively from certain\nheights. Occurrence of plastic hinges on the pipe structure was observed during the\nprocess of indentation, which allowed the creation of an important relationship\nbetween the dent depth and external impact force.\nObviously, the analyses have revealed that internal pressure has a significant\ninfluence on the pipe resistance to the deformation subjected to impact loading.\nNumerical analysis of these impact studies were carried out by using finite element\ncode LS-DYNA. The numerical models are able to capture the main trends in an\nadequate manner, and excellent agreement between theoretical, experimental and\nnumerical results has been obtained.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Kollika Nguon": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/178717", "BAB 1 Kollika Nguon": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/178718", "BAB 2 Kollika Nguon": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/178719", "BAB 3 Kollika Nguon": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/178720", "BAB 4 Kollika Nguon": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/178721", "BAB 5 Kollika Nguon": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/178722", "PUSTAKA Kollika Nguon": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/178723"}, "Penulis": "Kollika Nguon [23105024]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
