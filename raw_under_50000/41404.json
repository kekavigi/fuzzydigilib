{"Nomor": 41404, "Judul": "Symbiotic mutualism with a community of opportunistic ants: protection, competition, and ant occupancy of the myrmecophyte Barteria nigritana (Passifloraceae)", "Abstrak": "Barteria nigritana is a myrmecophyte tree of Lower Guinea coastal vegetation. Unlike the more specialised B. fistulosa, which harbours a single host-specific mutualistic ant, B. nigritana is associated with several opportunistic ants. Such symbiotic, yet opportunistic, ant\u2013plant associations have been little studied. On 113 clumps of B. nigritana, we censused ant associates and herbivores and compared herbivory on plants occupied by different ants. In addition to these correlative data, protection conferred by different ant species was compared by herbivore-placement experiments...", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Champlain Djieto [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Alain Dejean, Marc Gibernau"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Barteria nigritana; Crematogaster sp.; Oecophylla longinoda; Pheidole megacephala; Acraea zetes; Ant\u2013plant interactions; Protection mutualism", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect, Acta Oecologica 26 (2004) 109\u2013116", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Agu 2019"}
