{"Nomor": 44695, "Judul": "Passenger Stability Within Moving Railway Vehicles: Limits on Maximum Longitudinal Acceleration", "Abstrak": "Increasing the acceleration and deceleration of\ntrains within a railway network can improve the performance of the system. However, the risk of passengers\nlosing their balance and falling is also increased. The\npurpose of this paper is therefore to examine the effect of\nlongitudinal vehicle accelerations on passenger safety and\ncomfort. The literature review brings together two separate\ndisciplinary areas, considering the effects of acceleration\non balance from a physiological/kinesiological perspective,\nas well as looking at the results of previous empirical\nstudies on the levels of acceleration that railway passengers\nwill tolerate. The paper also describes an experiment carried out on the Tyne and Wear Metro, which gathered data\non typical acceleration levels to compare against the findings of the literature review. It was found that both the\nmagnitude of the accelerations and their rate of change\n(jerk) are important. The results also suggest that there may\nbe scope to improve the trade-off between journey times,\nenergy consumption and passenger comfort by fine control\nof the acceleration/jerk profile. This is particularly relevant\nto urban rail systems, as they typically feature relatively\nhigh acceleration and deceleration. However, the findings\nfor passenger comfort are equally applicable to conventional regional and intercity services.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "J. P.
