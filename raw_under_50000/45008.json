{"Nomor": 45008, "Judul": "Role of gravity and capillary waves in the origin of circular hydraulic jumps", "Abstrak": "In almost all of the studies on the circular hydraulic jump (CHJ), gravity had been\nconsidered as a significant variable that affects the formation of the jump. Most recently,\ngravity was deprived of being important in the origin of the CHJ, which challenged\nresearchers in this field of fluid mechanics. This study addresses in detail the physical\nconcepts behind this intriguing phenomenon occurring in the radial outspreading of a\nvertically downward free-surface liquid impinging jet upon a horizontal plate. The aim is\nto find out whether gravity plays any role in the origin of the CHJ. Accordingly, the jump\nevolution is investigated in two cases: first, the initial formation of the CHJ in which the\nsubcritical flow downstream from the jump is approaching the outlet boundary (developing\njump). Second, the final evolution of the CHJ in which a steady-state flow is circumventing\nan obstacle at the edge of the impinged plate and falling uniformly down from the\noutlet boundary (developed jump). The results indicate the existence of two different flow\nregimes in the jump formation: gravity- and capillary-dominant flow regimes. In general,\nthe role of gravity in the formation of developing or developed jumps cannot be eliminated;\nhowever, its importance lies in the fact of which regime dominates the flow. Intensification\nof gravitational effects is observed when capillary waves are dampened by increasing\nviscosity, density, or volume flow rate as well as by decreasing surface tension. Finally,\na generalized scaling relation for the jump radius is obtained considering both capillary\nand gravitational effects in the critical flow condition. In contrast to the previous results,\nthis generalized scaling relation predicts more accurately the radius of both a developing\nand a developed jump.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hossein Askarizadeh [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hossein Ahmadikia, Claas Ehrenpreis, Reinhold Kneer  Ahmadreza Pishevar, and Wilko Rohlfs"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS 4, 114002 (2019), APS", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Nov 2019"}
