{"Nomor": 45798, "Judul": "Oxygen vacancy induced performance enhancement of toluene catalytic oxidation using LaFeO3 perovskite oxides", "Abstrak": "Surface oxygen vacancies have been demonstrated to be an important factor for volatile organic compounds\n(VOCs) catalytic oxidation. In this work, the oxygen vacancy over LaFeO3 perovskite oxides was tuned by the\nway of controlling A-site cation deficiency. The catalysts were synthesized through the Pechini method and\ninvestigated for the complete oxidation of toluene.....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mudi Wu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Shiyi Chen?, Wenguo Xiang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Perovskite, Catalytic oxidation, DFT, LaFeO3, Oxygen vacancy, Toluene", "Sumber": "Chemical Engineering Journal journal, www.elsevier.com/locate/cej", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Jan 2020"}
