{"Nomor": 45175, "Judul": "Emergent Quasicrystalline Symmetry in Light-Induced Quantum Phase Transitions", "Abstrak": "The discovery of quasicrystals with crystallographically forbidden rotational symmetries has changed\nthe notion of the ordering in materials, yet little is known about the dynamical emergence of such exotic\nforms of order. Here we theoretically study a nonequilibrium cavity-QED setup realizing a zerotemperature quantum phase transition from a homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate to a quasicrystalline phase via collective superradiant light scattering. Across the superradiant phase transition, collective light scattering creates a dynamical, quasicrystalline optical potential for the atoms. Remarkably, the quasicrystalline potential is \u201cemergent\u201d as its eightfold rotational symmetry is not present in the Hamiltonian of the system, rather appears solely in the low-energy states. For sufficiently strong twobody contact interactions between atoms, a quasicrystalline order is stabilized in the system, while for\nweakly interacting atoms the condensate is localized in one or few of the deepest minima of the\nquasicrystalline potential.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Farokh Mivehvar [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Helmut Ritsch, and Francesco Piazza"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 123, 210604 (2019), APS", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Nov 2019"}
