A steady - state friction force versus\nvelocity is called the Stribeck curve has been proposed in Helouvry (1991) and\nHelouvry (1994) has been used widely in many fields to predict or analyze the\ncharacteristics of steady-state friction of the mechanical systems. However, the\nsteady -state friction models are not enough or useless to predict the motion of\na mechanical system especially for the cases that the mechanical system repeats\nstart/stop or inching motion.\nSo far, there are several friction models have been developed such as static model,\nDahl's Model, Bliman - Sarine Model, Generalized Maxwell-slip Model LuGre\nModel. Among these models, Lugre Model is widely used, because it captures\nmany aspects of friction like stiction, stick slip, stribeck, zero slip displacement,\nhowever this model cannot simulate the real hysteretic characteristics of hydraulic\nactuators.\nA method to modify Lugre Model in order to overcome the defect of Lugre Model\nwhich is, taking the dynamic of lubricant film formation into consideration. The\nfriction force of the hydraulic cylinder is measured base on the equation of motion\nusing the measured value of cylinder chambers and the acceleration of the hydraulic\npiston. Measured friction characteristics are compared to simulated ones by the\nModified Lugre Model. This model was proposed in BoTran (2012), there a twelve\nparameters in modified lugre model, those parameters identification was proposed\nin YANADA et al. (2008), however there is still another method to identify those\nparameters, therefore, in this thesis is about to find a method to identify the parameters\nKeywords: Lugre Model, lubricant film thickness.", "Daftar File": {"2019 TS S2 23117703  Nguyen dinh Hoe.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/179945"}, "Penulis": "Hoe Nguyen Dinh [23117703]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
