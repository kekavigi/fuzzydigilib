A perfect periodic structure\nwithout interface cracks is first studied and the transmission displacement coefficient is obtained\nbased on the transfer matrix method in conjunction with the Bloch-Floquet theorem. This is\nthen generalized to a single and periodic distribution of cracks at the center interface and the\nresult is compared with that of perfect periodic cases without interface cracks. The dependence of\nthe transmission displacement coefficient on the frequency of the incident wave, the influences of\nmaterial combination, crack configuration and incident angle are discussed in detail. Compared\nwith the corresponding perfect periodic structure without interface cracks, a new phenomenon is\nfound in the periodic layered system with a single and periodic array of interface cracks.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zhizhong Yan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Chunqiu Wei, Chuanzeng Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "layered composite, transmission coefficient, interface crack, transfer matrix method", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 5, October, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Agu 2019"}
