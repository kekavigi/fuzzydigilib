{"Nomor": 45033, "Judul": "Temperature-dependent magnetocrystalline anisotropy of rare earth/transition metal permanent magnets from first principles: The light RCo5 (R=Y, La-Gd) intermetallics", "Abstrak": "Computational design of more efficient rare earth/transition metal (RE-TM) permanent magnets requires\naccurately calculating the magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA) at finite temperature, since this property places an upper bound on the coercivity. Here, we present a first-principles methodology to calculate the MCA of RE-TM magnets which fully accounts for the effects of temperature on the underlying electrons. The itinerant electron TM magnetism is described within the disordered local moment picture, and the localized RE-4f magnetism is described within crystal field theory. We use our model, which is free of adjustable parameters, to calculate the MCA of the RCo5 (R = Y, La-Gd) magnet family for temperatures 0\u2013600 K. We correctly find a huge uniaxial anisotropy for SmCo5 (21.3MJm?3 at 300 K) and two finite temperature spin reorientation transitions for NdCo5. The calculations also demonstrate dramatic valency effects in CeCo5 and PrCo5. Our calculations provide quantitative, first-principles insight into several decades of RE-TM experimental studies.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Christopher E.
