{"Nomor": 41345, "Judul": "Simulating the rice yield change in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River under SRES B2 scenario", "Abstrak": "As one of the most important crops in China, rice accounts for 18% of the country\u2019s total cultivated area.\nIncreasing atmospheric CO2 concentration and associated climate change may greatly affect the rice productivity. Therefore, understanding the impacts of climate change on rice production is of great significance. This paper aims to examine the potential impacts of future climate change on the rice yield in\nthe middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which is one of the most important food production\nregions in China. Climate data generated by the regional climate Model PRECIS for the baseline (1961\u2013\n1990) and future (2021\u20132050) period under IPCC SRES B2 scenario were employed as the input of the rice\ncrop model ORYZA2000. Four experimental schemes were carried out to evaluate the effects of future\nclimate warming, CO2 fertilization and water managements (i.e., irrigation and rain-fed) on rice production.\nThe results indicated that the average rice growth duration would be shortened by 4 days and the\naverage rice yield would be declined by more than 14% as mean temperature raised by 1.5 C during the\nrice growing season in 2021\u20132050 period under B2 scenario....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Shen Shuang-He [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yang Shen-Bin, Zhao Yan-Xia, Xu Yin-Long, Zhao Xiao-Yan, Wang Zhu-Yu, Liu Juan, Zhang Wei-Wei"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Rice, ORYZA2000, Yangtze River zone, Climate change", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect, Acta Ecologica Sinica 31 (2011) 40\u201348", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Agu 2019"}
