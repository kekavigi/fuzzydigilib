Thermal, electrical,\nambient and mechanical stress on the transformer leads to faster ageing of the\ninsulation system. When there is an evolving fault in a power transformer, it forms\ngases in the insulation oil, which can be recognized with the right kind of\nmeasurement methods. DGA is a method of condition assessment and monitoring, it\ncan be done to detect faults that occur.\nThe accuracy of the dissolved gas analysis is influenced by many factors, including\ndiffusion, gas properties, oil samples, etc. The gas properties, as well as the\nsolubility of the gas is greatly influenced by temperature, pressure, oil conditions,\nand type of insulating oil. Dissolved gases in transformers move in the insulating\nliquids through diffusion, natural temperature-dependent oil circulations and forced\nconvection. In a system, dissolved gases tend to reach an equilibrium state\nthroughout the entire system. When an equilibrium state is reached between the gas\nand the liquid phases, the correlation between the concentration of dissolved gases\nin the liquid and the partial pressure in the gas phase can be described using Henry\u2019s\nlaw. In the first part of this thesis, a measuring method for the solubility of gases in\nmineral oil insulation is developed. The second part deals with key gases, which are\nmeasured at different oil temperatures and the corresponding Henry constants,\nwhich are to be determined. The main focus here is on the two gases: CH4 and C2H6\nmeasured at different temperatures (25 \u00b0C, 50 \u00b0C, 75 \u00b0C and 90 \u00b0C). The objective\nof this study is to determine Henry's constants from the gas solubility in mineral oil\nat specified temperature and at an equilibrium state. The experiment have been\nsuccessfully carried out to determine the Henry's constant using a state-of-the-art\ntest method. The Henry constants of the CH4 are decreasing and of C2H6 are\nincreasing with increasing temperature. C2H6 is more easily dissolved in mineral oil\ncompared to CH4.", "Daftar File": {"Cover, Abstract & Lembar Pengesahan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/207531", "Tesis": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/210165"}, "Penulis": "I Gusti Ngurah Mahendrayana [23218063]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
