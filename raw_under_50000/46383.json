{"Nomor": 46383, "Judul": "FABRICATION OF MULTITARGETING AND PH-REGULATED NANOCOMPOSITES FOR ANTITUMOR PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY BASED ON TRIPHENYLPHOSPHINE AND GRAPHENE OXIDE", "Abstrak": "Targeted delivery of photosensitizer for antitumor photodynamic\ntherapy has received much attention recently. In this research, a multitargeting\ngraphene oxide (GO) nanosystem (GFFP-TPPa) was fabricated based on the\nmagnetically targeted nano-Fe3O4, active targeted folic acid (FA), and\nmitochondria-targeted triphenylphosphine, aiming to provide an effective drug\ndelivery system of photosensitizer for improved photodynamic therapy against\nhuman tumor. The effective photosensitizer release from GFFP-TPPa under\nmild acidic pH condition (such as tumor microenvironment) suggested our\ndesigned nanosystem could reduce cutaneous phototoxicity of nanoparticles\n(NPs) in normal cells environment, which was further verified by the observation\nthat the fluorescence of GFFP-TPPa was significantly quenched compared with\nfree PPa. Research of cellular morphological variation, uptaking test, and\nintracellular single oxygen detection has validated the effectiveness of GFFP-TPPa NPs against tumor cells and potential fluorescence imaging function. Moreover, GFFP-TPPa NPs have excellent superparamagnetic properties and FA-targeted property of NPs, which was verified by the tumor cellular uptake of GFFP-TPPa. Finally, the precise deliver of photosensitizer to mitochondria has been proved by Mito-Tracker Green organelle localization. Our research indicated that the fabricated nanosystem could be applied conveniently for PDT based on multitargetability.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ying Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hongyue Zhang, Xiang Qin, Chen Yang, Zhiqiang Wang, Yingxue Jin*"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "multitargeting, pH-regulated, photodynamic therapy, triphenylphosphine, graphene oxide", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "03 Mar 2020"}
