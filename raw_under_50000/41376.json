{"Nomor": 41376, "Judul": "SPECTROSCOPIC SIGNATURES OF MANY-BODY CORRELATIONS IN MAGIC-ANGLE  GRAPHENETWISTED BILAYER", "Abstrak": "The discovery of superconducting and insulating states in magicangle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG)1,2 has ignited considerable interest in understanding the nature of electronic interactions in this chemically pristine material. The transport properties\nof MATBG as a function of doping are similar to those of hightransition-temperature copper oxides and other unconventional superconductors1\u20133, which suggests that MATBG may be a highly interacting system. However, to our knowledge, there is no direct experimental evidence of strong many-body correlations in MATBG.\nHere we present high-resolution spectroscopic measurements, obtained using a scanning tunnelling microscope, that provide such evidence as a function of carrier density. MATBG displays unusual spectroscopic characteristics that can be attributed to electron\u2013electron interactions over a wide range of doping levels, including\nthose at which superconductivity emerges in this system. We show that our measurements cannot be explained with a mean-field approach for modelling electron\u2013electron interactions in MATBG. The breakdown of a mean-field approach when applied to other correlated superconductors, such as copper oxides, has long inspired\nthe study of the highly correlated Hubbard model3. We show that a\nphenomenological extended-Hubbard-model cluster calculation, which is motivated by the nearly localized nature of the relevant electronic states of MATBG, produces spectroscopic features that are similar to those that we observed experimentally. Our\nfindings demonstrate the critical role of many-body correlations in understanding the properties of MATBG.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "YONGLONG, XIE [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["BIAO, LIAN, etc"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Astronomi", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "SPECTROSCOPY", "Sumber": "NA T U RE | VOL 572 | 1 AUGUS T 2019", "Staf Input/Edit": "pustaka bosscha", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Agu 2019"}
