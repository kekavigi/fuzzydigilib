{"Nomor": 41335, "Judul": "Implications of calcium nutrition on the response of Caesalpinia crista (Fabaceae) to soil salinity", "Abstrak": "Greenhouse experiments were conducted to assess the effects of supplemental calcium in salinised soil\non the response of germination and seedling growth of Caesalpinia crista, L. (Fabaceae). NaCl and\nCaSO42H2O were added to the soil and 0:0, !:0, 1:0.25, 1:0.50, 1:0.75, 1:1, 1:1.25, and 1:1.50 Na/Ca ratios\nwere maintained. Salinity significantly retarded the seed germination and seedling growth, but the injurious\neffects of NaCl on seed germination were ameliorated and seedling growth was restored with calcium\nsupply at the critical level (1:0.50 Na/Ca ratio) to salinised soil. Calcium supply above the critical\nlevel further retarded the seed germination and seedling growth due to the increased soil salinity. Salt\nstress reduced N, P, K and Ca content in plant tissues, but these nutrients were restored by addition of\ncalcium at the critical level to saline soil. The opposite was true for Na+. The results are discussed in terms\nof the beneficial effects of calcium supply on the seedling growth of C. crista grown under saline\nconditions.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Neha Tusharbhai Patel [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pratiksha Mukeshbhai Vaghela, Ashish Dahyabhai Patel, Amar Nath Pandey"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Salt stress, Calcium nutrition, Seedling growth, Recovery, Water status, Salt tolerance, Caesalpinia crista", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect, Acta Ecologica Sinica 31 (2011) 24\u201330", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Agu 2019"}
