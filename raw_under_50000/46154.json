{"Nomor": 46154, "Judul": "METALLA-ELECTROCATALYZED C?H ACTIVATION BY EARTH-ABUNDANT 3D METALS AND BEYOND", "Abstrak": "To improve the efficacy of molecular syntheses, researchers wish to capitalize upon the selective modification of otherwise inert C?H bonds. The past two decades have witnessed considerable advances in coordination chemistry that have set the stage for transformative tools for C?H functionalizations. Particularly, oxidative C?H/C?H and C?H/Het?H transformations have gained major attention because they avoid all elements of substrate prefunctionalization. Despite considerable advances, oxidative C?H activations have been dominated by precious transition metal catalysts based on palladium, ruthenium,\niridium, and rhodium, thus compromising the sustainable nature of the overall C?H activation approach....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lutz Ackermann [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Metalla-electrocatalyzed C?H Activation, Earth-Abundant 3d Metals and Beyond", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Feb 2020"}
