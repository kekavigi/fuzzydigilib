{"Nomor": 42316, "Judul": "Multiple memristor series\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdparallel connections with use in synaptic circuit design", "Abstrak": "With the increase of research interest on memristors, various single or multiple memristor configurations have\nbeen integrated with advanced complementary metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconducor technology, which promises efficient\nimplementations of synaptic connections in neuromorphic computing systems, or computing elements in signal\nprocessing systems. In this study, multiple memristors, both in series and parallel connections, and their characteristics are further studied including the transient behaviours when asynchronous change happens and the composite electric properties in steady state etc. Particularly, the specific conditions to reach steady state and produce composite memristive effects are presented in detail. Furthermore, several synaptic memristor circuits based on series and parallel connections are also discussed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Li Luo [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiaofang Hu, Shukai Duan, Zhekang Dong, Lidan Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "IET Circuits, Devices & Systems", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Sep 2019"}
