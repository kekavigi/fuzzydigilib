{"Nomor": 44907, "Judul": "Conformally soft theorem in gauge theory", "Abstrak": "Asymptotic particle states in four-dimensional celestial scattering amplitudes are labeled by their\nSL\u00f02;C\u00de Lorentz/conformal weights \u00f0h; \u00afh\u00de rather than the usual energy-momentum four-vector. These\nboost eigenstates involve a superposition of all energies. As such, celestial gluon (or photon) scattering\ncannot obey the usual (energetically) soft theorems. In this paper we show that tree-level celestial gluon\nscattering, in theories with sufficiently soft UV behavior, instead obeys conformally soft theorems\ninvolving h ? 0 or \u00afh ? 0. Unlike the energetically soft theorem, the conformally soft theorem cannot be\nderived from low-energy effective field theory.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Monica Pate [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ana-Maria Raclariu,", "and Andrew Strominger"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW D 100, 085017 (2019), APS", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Nov 2019"}
