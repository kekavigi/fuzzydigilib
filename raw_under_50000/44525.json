{"Nomor": 44525, "Judul": "The Implementation of Fuzzy Expert Systems on Concrete Bridge Investigation with Octave", "Abstrak": "ABSTRACT: Bridge is an infrastructure that has an important role in economic activities\nof the community. Throughout its service period, a bridge experiences various problems\ndue to environmental factors and traffic loads. This study is focused on investigating the\nconditions of concrete bridge infrastructure in Surakarta, Indonesia based on fuzzy expert\nsystem method developed with Octave open source software as tool. This study is conducted\nby building a fuzzy expert system application based on bridge members\u2019 conditions to\nobtain overall level performance of the bridge. In general, this research is divided into\nthree parts. Firstly, to conduct surveys of several bridges conditions as sample data for\napplication. Secondly, to build a model of fuzzy membership function and fuzzy inference\nengine for each type of bridge condition. Thirdly, to develop an application of fuzzy expert\nsystem based on the model developed with Octave. The result of the research can be used\nin an expert system application to determine the condition level of the bridges", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Setiono [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wibowo ,  Sofa Marwoto"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Civil engineering", "Kata Kunci": "Bridge investigation, concrete bridge, fuzzy expert systems, Octave, Surakarta", "Sumber": "Journal of Physical Science, Vol. 29(Supp. 2), 147\u2013157, 2018", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Okt 2019"}
