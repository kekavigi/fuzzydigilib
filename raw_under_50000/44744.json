{"Nomor": 44744, "Judul": "Superhigh-Resolution Recognition of Optical Vortex Modes Assisted by a Deep-Learning Method", "Abstrak": "Orbital angular momentum (OAM) has demonstrated great success in the optical communication field,\nwhich theoretically allows an infinite increase of the transmitted capacity. The resolution of a receiver to\nprecisely recognize OAMmodes is crucial to expand the communication capacity. Here, we propose a deep learning (DL) method to precisely recognize OAM modes with fractional topological charges. The\nminimum interval recognized between adjacent modes decreases to 0.01, which as far as we know is the\nfirst time this superhigh resolution has been realized. To exhibit its efficiency in the optical communication\nprocess, we transfer an Einstein portrait by a superhigh-resolution OAM multiplexing system. As the\nconvolutional neuron networks can be trained by data up to an infinitely large volume in theory, this work\nexhibits a huge potential of generalized suitability for next generation DL based ultrafine OAM optical\ncommunication, which might even be applied to microwave, millimeter wave, and terahertz OAM\ncommunication systems.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ZHANWEI LIU [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Shuo Yan,", "Haigang Liu,", "and Xianfeng Chen"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 123, 183902 (2019), APS", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Nov 2019"}
