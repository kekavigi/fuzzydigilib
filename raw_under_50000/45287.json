{"Nomor": 45287, "Judul": "High Efficiency Dark-to-Bright Exciton Conversion in Carbon Nanotubes", "Abstrak": "We report that dark excitons can have a large contribution to the emission intensity in carbon nanotubes\ndue to an efficient exciton conversion from a dark state to a bright state. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements are used to investigate decay dynamics and diffusion properties of excitons, and we obtain intrinsic lifetimes and diffusion lengths of bright excitons as well as diffusion coefficients for both bright and dark excitons. We find that the dark-to-bright transition rates can be considerably high and that more than half of the dark excitons can be converted into the bright excitons. The state-transition rates have a large chirality dependence with a family pattern, and the conversion efficiency is found to be significantly enhanced by adsorbed air molecules on the surface of the nanotubes. By understanding the importance of the dark exciton diffusion and the surface condition on the conversion process, performance improvement of nanotube light emitters is expected. Our findings show the nontrivial significance of the dark excitons on the emission kinetics in low-dimensional materials and demonstrate the potential for engineering the darkto-bright conversion process by using surface interactions.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "A.
