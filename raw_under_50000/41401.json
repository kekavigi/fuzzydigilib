{"Nomor": 41401, "Judul": "The influence of soil moisture on losses of buried seeds to fungi", "Abstrak": "Although soil fungi are likely to be a major cause of mortality for buried seeds, few ecological studies have examined the role these pathogens play in natural systems. In particular, few studies have investigated whether losses of seeds to soil fungi are habitat-dependent.We used fungicide treatments to investigate whether losses of buried seeds of four grasses (Bromus inermis, Danthonia spicata, Glyceria striata,\nand Poa pratensis) to soil fungi differed among meadows differing in soil moisture.We also applied water to some treatments, to determine whether this increased losses of seeds to fungi. For all four grasses, fungicide additions improved one or more measures of seed viability, though this effect was small. For Danthonia and Glyceria, fungicide was less likely to improve viability in dry meadows than in wet and/or\nmesic meadows. Adding water reduced some measures of viability of seeds of Danthonia and Poa in dry meadows, but fungicide partly counteracted these negative effects, suggesting that adding water reduced performance by increasing fungal attack. These results indicate that fungi represent a hazard for buried seeds of these species, particularly in wetter soils, and potentially may contribute to the reduction of\npopulations of vulnerable species in wetter sites. \u00a9 2003 \u00c9ditions scientifiques et m\u00e9dicales Elsevier SAS.
