The forces which govern the motion are mutual gravitational attractions of the primaries, and radiation pressure force emitted from the more massive body. The equations of motion for the four bodies have taken into account the radiation pressure. We have deduced that these equations can be solved by Laplace transformations; the eigenvalues are obtained to study the motion about the libration points which are taken from the classical method, then the stability around the libration points is studied. The results obtained are presented. We remark that this model has special importance in astrodynamics to send spacecraft to stable regions to move in gravitational fields for some planetary system.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "M.N.Ismail [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sahar H.Younis, Fatma M.Elmalky"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Astronomy", "Kata Kunci": "Dynamical systems, Lagrangian points, Radiation pressure, Laplace transforms, Stability of equilibrium points, Restricted four-body problem", "Sumber": "NRIAG Journal of Astronomy and Geophysics Volume 7, Issue 2, December 2018, Pages 208-213", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Agu 2019"}
