{"Nomor": 44858, "Judul": "A Study Of The Performance Of The LSWA CO2 EOR Technique On Improvement Of Oil Recovery In Sandstones", "Abstrak": "Low salinity water is an emerging enhanced oil recovery (EOR) method that causes wettability alteration\ntowards a favorable state to reduce residual oil saturation, while water alternating gas (WAG) is a proven\nEOR process that enhances oil recovery by controlling mobility of both water and gas. Therefore,\ncombining the two EOR processes as low salinity water-alternating CO2 EOR injection (LSWA CO2) can\nfurther improve oil recovery by promoting the synergy of the mechanisms underlying these two\nmethods.\nCore flooding experiments, contact angle, interfacial tension (IFT), and CO2 solubility measurement in\noil and brine were conducted to investigate the viability and performance of LSWA CO2 in sandstone\nreservoirs. A favorable wettability alteration, along with IFT reduction and mobility control, are the\nmechanisms that contribute to residual oil mobilization efficiencies during the LSWA CO2 EOR process. In\naddition, LSWA CO2 core flooding experiments result in a significant incremental oil recovery.\nThree smart waters were tested in our research, to examine the impact of changing cationic composition on oil recovery. The solutions are designed brines as NaCl (SW1), MgCl2 (SW2), and KCl (SW3). Of\nthe three solutions, SW1 yields the highest incremental oil recovery and highest IFT reduction. In\naddition, it results in a favorable wettability alteration towards a more water-wet state.\nIn all cases, introducing CO2 to the brine/oil system shows a great advantage in terms of enhancing\nwettability modification, promoting IFT reduction, and controlling the displacement front of the injected\nfluid through mobility control.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "H.
