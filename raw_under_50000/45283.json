{"Nomor": 45283, "Judul": "Oxygen Quadclusters in SiO2 Glass above Megabar Pressures up to 160 GPa Revealed by X-Ray Raman Scattering", "Abstrak": "As oxygen may occupy a major volume of oxides, a densification of amorphous oxides under extreme\ncompression is dominated by reorganization of oxygen during compression. X-ray Raman scattering\n(XRS) spectra for SiO2 glass up to 1.6 Mbar reveal the evolution of heavily contracted oxygen\nenvironments characterized by a decrease in average O-O distance and the potential emergence of\nquadruply coordinated oxygen (oxygen quadcluster). Our results also reveal that the edge energies at the\ncenters of gravity of the XRS features increase linearly with bulk density, yielding the first predictive\nrelationship between the density and partial density of state of oxides above megabar pressures. The\nextreme densification paths with densified oxygen in amorphous oxides shed light upon the possible\nexistence of stable melts in the planetary interiors.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Sung Keun Lee [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yong-Hyun Kim , Yoo Soo Yi , Paul Chow ,3 Yuming Xiao , Cheng Ji, and Guoyin Shen"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 123, 235701 (2019), APS", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Des 2019"}
