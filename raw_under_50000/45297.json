{"Nomor": 45297, "Judul": "Shortcuts to adiabaticity: Concepts, methods, and applications", "Abstrak": "Shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) are fast routes to the final results of slow, adiabatic changes of the\ncontrolling parameters of a system. The shortcuts are designed by a set of analytical and numerical\nmethods suitable for different systems and conditions. A motivation to apply STA methods to\nquantum systems is to manipulate them on timescales shorter than decoherence times. Thus\nshortcuts to adiabaticity have become instrumental in preparing and driving internal and motional\nstates in atomic, molecular, and solid-state physics. Applications range from information transfer\nand processing based on gates or analog paradigms to interferometry and metrology. The\nmultiplicity of STA paths for the controlling parameters may be used to enhance robustness\nversus noise and perturbations or to optimize relevant variables. Since adiabaticity is a widespread\nphenomenon, STA methods also extended beyond the quantum world to optical devices, classical\nmechanical systems, and statistical physics. Shortcuts to adiabaticity combine well with other\nconcepts and techniques, in particular, with optimal control theory, and pose fundamental scientific\nand engineering questions such as finding speed limits, quantifying the third law, or determining\nprocess energy costs and efficiencies. Concepts, methods, and applications of shortcuts to\nadiabaticity are reviewed and promising prospects are outlined, as well as open questions and\nchallenges ahead.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "D.
