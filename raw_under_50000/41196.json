{"Nomor": 41196, "Judul": "STUDY ON PERFORMANCE AND EMISSION CHARATERISTICS OF BIO-AVTUR FROM COCONUT OIL IN GAS TURBINE ENGINE", "Abstrak": "Performance and emissions characteristics of a gas turbine engine type Rover 1S/60 burning Jet A1, 5% Bio-avtur/95% Jet A1 blend by volume were studied over a range of engine operating conditions. The addition of bio-avtur resulted in a no significant change in engine performance. The CO2 emissions from the turbine when running on Bio-avtur/Jet A1 blend were increased slightly comparing to those of Jet A1 while CO, HC and NOx tend to the same. The results suggest that bio-avtur has high potential to be a good aviation alternative fuel in the future. However, due to the limit in cold properties this bio-avtur should be blended with Jet A1 to increase fuel properties which reach to the requirements of aviation fuel standard (ASTM D1655/ Def. Stan 91-91).", "Daftar File": {"COVER Duong Hoang Long": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/178217", "BAB 1 Duong Hoang Long": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/178218", "BAB 2 Duong Hoang Long": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/178219", "BAB 3 Duong Hoang Long": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/178220", "BAB 4 Duong Hoang Long": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/178221", "BAB 5 Duong Hoang Long": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/178222", "BAB 6 Duong Hoang Long": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/178223", "PUSTAKA Duong Hoang Long": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/178224"}, "Penulis": "Duong Hoang Long [23110302]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Iman Kartolaksono R.", "Prof. Wiranto Arismunandar"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Mesin", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "Gas turbine engine, bio-avtur, bio-jet, aviation alternative fuel, gas turbine emissions.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "8 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Jul 2019"}
