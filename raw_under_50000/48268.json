{"Nomor": 48268, "Judul": "SIMULATION OF WAYPOINT-FOLLOWING FOR HIGH-SPEED MINIBE USING X-PLANE", "Abstrak": "X-Plane is a simulation software which provides simulation environment for aircraft. X-Plane also allows other software to receive data for processing and send it back to X-Plane through UDP port connection to automate its controls. One of the software that is capable of such things is Matlab\u2019s Simulink.\nIn this bachelor thesis, a waypoint guidance system is developed for High-Speed MiniBe using X-Plane and Matlab\u2019s Simulink. The modelling process is done through X-Plane\u2019s Plane Maker using several techniques and assumptions. A model is designed in Simulink to process the data received from X-Plane and then sent back to act as a waypoint guidance and autopilot which provides necessary commands to the aircraft. The focus of this bachelor thesis is on the lateral-directional plane only. Simulation results shows that High-Speed MiniBe can function properly with the designed waypoint following and autopilot control system.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Kresna Haryo Wicahyo": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/207993"}, "Penulis": "Kresna Haryo Wicahyo [13616107]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
