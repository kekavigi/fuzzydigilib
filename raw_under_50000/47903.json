{"Nomor": 47903, "Judul": "OPTIMIZATION OF PARTIAL DISCHARGE DETECTION SENSITIVITY OF TRANSIENT EARTH VOLTAGE SENSORS USING FDTD MODELING", "Abstrak": "Partial discharge (PD) measurement provides early warning information for\nassessing the condition of high voltage (HV) power equipment insulation systems,\nso maintenance can be taken to prevent service interruption due to isolation failures.\nMany methods and sensors have been tried and developed to detect PD. PD\nproduces electromagnetic waves that can be detected using transient earth voltage\n(TEV) sensors. The TEV sensor is small, and it can be easily used by attaching the\nsensor to the metal casing of power equipment in several positions. This paper\npresents the optimization of TEV sensor by electromagnetic wave propagation\nsimulation using three-dimension finite difference time domain (FDTD) modeling.\nThe structure of the newly proposed TEV sensor is optimized for partial discharge\nmeasurement in terms of a more compact physical construction and simpler to\nmanufacture. The TEV sensor structure was developed and optimized using the\nFDTD software domain before the physical sensor was tested. The approach in this\npaper will help to make TEV sensor designs more compact in certain applications\nin the future.", "Daftar File": {"Abstrak": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/207477", "Tesis": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/209691"}, "Penulis": "Satya Hari Wibowo [23218005]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
