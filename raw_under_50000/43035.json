{"Nomor": 43035, "Judul": "Controlling fixed trap charge effect in FinFET using heterodielectric BOX", "Abstrak": "This Letter presents an Si FinFET on heterodielectric BOX, where the\neffect of trap charges can be avoided. The investigation is based on a\n3D simulation study. The BOX height also plays a significant role in\nthe device characteristics. The effect of trap charges using homodielectric\nand heterodielectric BOX is verified by plotting the electron\ndensity across a 2D cross section in the middle of the channel. The\nauthors further investigated the effect of temperatures, ranging from\nroom temperature to higher temperatures. The FinFET, with heterodielectric\nBOX, shows no trap effect even when the temperature is\nvaried. On the other hand, a visible temperature effect is observed in\ncase of homodielectric BOX. Moreover, in case of homodielectric\nBOX, the ON\u2013OFF performance metric, (Q) is affected in presence\nof trap charges; whereas no change is observed when a heterodielectric\nBOX is used. As such, it is found that the FinFET with heterodielectric\nBOX is more reliable and useful for current semiconductor industries.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Rajashree Das  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Srimanta Baishya"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "ELECTRONICS LETTERS 22nd February 2018 Vol. 54 No. 4 pp. 239\u2013241", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Sep 2019"}
