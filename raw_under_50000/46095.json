{"Nomor": 46095, "Judul": "INTERACTIONS OF ORAL MOLECULAR EXCIPIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER RESISTANCE PROTEIN, BCRP", "Abstrak": "Mechanistic-understanding-based selection of excipients may improve formulation\ndevelopment strategies for generic drug products and potentially accelerate their approval. Our\nstudy aimed at investigating the effects of molecular excipients present in orally administered FDAapproved drug products on the intestinal efflux transporter, BCRP (ABCG2), which plays a critical\nrole in drug absorption with potential implications on drug safety and efficacy. We determined the\ninteractions of 136 oral molecular excipients with BCRP in isolated membrane vesicles and\nidentified 26 excipients as BCRP inhibitors with IC50 values less than 5 ?M using 3Hcholecystokinin\noctapeptide (3H-CCK8). These BCRP inhibitors belonged to three functional\ncategories of excipients: dyes, surfactants, and flavoring agents. Compared with noninhibitors,\nBCRP inhibitors had significantly higher molecular weights and SLogP values. The inhibitory\neffects of excipients identified in membrane vesicles were also evaluated in BCRP-overexpressing HEK293 cells at similar concentrations. Only 1 of the 26 inhibitors of BCRP identified in vesicles inhibited BCRP-mediated 3H-oxypurinol uptake by more than 50%, consistent with the notion that BCRP inhibition depends on transmembrane or intracellular availability of the inhibitors. Collectively, the results of this study provide new information on excipient selection during the development of drug products with active pharmaceutical ingredients that are BCRP substrates.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ling Zou [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Joshua Pottel, Natalia Khuri, Huy X.
