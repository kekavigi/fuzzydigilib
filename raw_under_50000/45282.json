{"Nomor": 45282, "Judul": "Integrating Neural Networks with a Quantum Simulator for State Reconstruction", "Abstrak": "We demonstrate quantum many-body state reconstruction from experimental data generated by a\nprogrammable quantum simulator by means of a neural-network model incorporating known experimental\nerrors. Specifically, we extract restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions from data produced by a\nRydberg quantum simulator with eight and nine atoms in a single measurement basis and apply a novel\nregularization technique to mitigate the effects of measurement errors in the training data. Reconstructions\nof modest complexity are able to capture one- and two-body observables not accessible to experimentalists,\nas well as more sophisticated observables such as the R\u00b4enyi mutual information. Our results open the door\nto integration of machine learning architectures with intermediate-scale quantum hardware.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Giacomo Torlai [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Brian Timar, Evert P.
