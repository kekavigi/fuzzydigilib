{"Nomor": 40904, "Judul": "Phytoremediatgion of wastewater containing azo dye by sunflowers and their photosynthetic response", "Abstrak": "Azo dyes, as the largest group of synthetic dyes released from textile and dyestuff industries, have caused\nserious environmental problems. We investigated the removal ability and physiological response of sunflowers\nto simulated wastewater containing azo dyes with concentration similar to real wastewater or\nabove. The percent decolorization of the three azo dyes within 4 days varied greatly. For the same dyes,\nthe percent decolorization was descending with the primary dye concentration increasing. The percent\ndecolorization of Bismark browny, Evans blue and Orange G at same concentration was also descending.\nThe average percent decolorization of the three azo dyes at 100 mg/L within 4 days was 62.64%. The physiological\neffects of the tested azo dyes on sunflowers were also very different. The stress effects of Bismark\nbrowny, Evans blue and Orange G at same concentration were also descending. All tested azo\ndyes reduced significantly normalized relative transpiration (NRT), net photosynthesis rate (Pn), transpiration\nintensity (Tr) and stomatal conductance (Gs) of sunflowers. The percent of decline of all the indicators\nsuch as NRT, Pn, Tr and Gs was less than 50% when concentration of azo dyes was 100 mg/L. The\nresult showed that sunflowers can survive in water containing 100 mg/L all tested azo dyes. We conclude\nthat sunflowers can be used for phytoremediation of wastewater containing azo dyes.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xie Huicheng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Li Chongrong, Li Jihong, Wang Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Azo dyes, Phytoremediation, Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), Decolorization, Phytotoxicity, Net photosynthesis rate (Pn)", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Jul 2019"}
