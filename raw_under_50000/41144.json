The problem is in the context of fractional order heat con-\nduction. The governing equations with variable thermal properties were established by means\nof the fractional order calculus. The problem of a half-space formed of an elastic medium with\nvariable thermal material properties was solved, and asymptotic solutions induced by a sudden\ntemperature rise on the boundary were obtained by applying an asymptotic approach. The prop-\nagations of thermoelastic wave and thermal wave, as well as the distributions of displacement,\ntemperature and stresses were obtained and plotted. Variations in the distributions with differ-\nent values of fractional order parameter were discussed. The results were compared with those\nobtained from the case of constant material properties to evaluate the effects of variable material\nproperties on thermoelastic behaviors.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yingze Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dong Liu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "generalized thermoelasticity, fractional order heat conduction, variable thermal material properties, asymptotic solution, thermal shock", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 6, December, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Jul 2019"}
