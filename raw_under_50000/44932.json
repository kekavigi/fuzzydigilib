{"Nomor": 44932, "Judul": "Leading order corrections to the Bethe-Heitler process in the ?p ? l + l ? p reaction", "Abstrak": "The ratio of dilepton production cross sections on a proton, using the ?p ? l\u00fel?p process, above and\nbelow the dimuon production threshold allows one to extract the effective lepton-proton interaction, which\nis required to be identical for electrons and muons if lepton universality is exact. To test for a scenario of\nbroken universality at the percent level, of the size that could explain the different proton charge\nradii extracted from electron scattering and from muonic hydrogen spectroscopy, we evaluate all\none-loop QED corrections to this process, including the full lepton mass dependencies. We furthermore\nshow that two photon\u2013exchange processes with both photons attached to the proton line vanish after\naveraging over dilepton angles and estimate the relatively small radiation off the proton. We compare the\nfull one-loop calculation with a soft-photon approximation of the same order and present estimates for a\nplanned experiment.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Matthias Heller [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Oleksandr Tomalak,", "Shihao Wu,", "and Marc Vanderhaeghen"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW D 100, 076013 (2019), APS", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Nov 2019"}
