{"Nomor": 44700, "Judul": "Drug Interactions in Space: a Cause for Concern?", "Abstrak": "Purpose Crewmembers aboard the International Space\nStation (ISS) have free access to an increasing number of\nmedications within medical kits. The aim of the current study\nwas to assess the number, severity and reliability of potential\ndrug-drug interactions (DDIs) involving those medications.\nMethods We evaluated the information obtained from clinical decision support systems. Searches for potential DDIs were\napplied to published lists of medications available to US astronauts in medical kits aboard the ISS.\nResults A total of 311 potential DDIs were identified by LexiInteract, of which approximately half were recognized by\nMicromedex as well. Major, moderate and minor interactions\nconsisted 23.5%, 68.5% and 8.0% of entries, respectively.\nThe reliability of 71.1% of alerts was fair. Commonly used\ndrugs, including zolpidem and zaleplon, were involved in multiple potential interactions that were classified as major based\non additive CNS depression.\nConclusions Most potential DDIs likely to be encountered in\nspace are unestablished even in terrestrial medicine and their\nassignment is based on class-effects. Yet, some drug combinations may be associated with clinically-relevant consequences.\nFuture DDI rating should be adjusted to space-related outcomes. Until that happens, it would be advisable to avoid nonestablished drug combinations in space when possible.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Erez Berman [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sara Eya"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Pharmacology & therapeutics", "Kata Kunci": "clinical decision support systems . drug-drug interactions .
