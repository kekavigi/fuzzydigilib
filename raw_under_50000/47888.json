{"Nomor": 47888, "Judul": "OPTIMAL TUNING OF UNIFIED POWER FLOW CONTROLLER USING FIREFLY ALGORITHM TO IMPROVE DAMPING OF INTER-AREA OSCILLATIONS IN MULTIMACHINE SYSTEM", "Abstrak": "Inter-area oscillation is a challenge in the interconnection system that affects\nthe stability of the power system. Conventional Power System Stabilizer (PSS) used\nto reduce small signal oscillations has limitations in inter-area oscillations. Therefore,\nin this thesis, a Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) damping control scheme is\nintroduced. The control parameters of UPFC-based PI Controllers are tuned with the\nFirefly Algorithm to increase the damping of inter-area oscillation in a multi-machine\nsystem. The performance will be compared with PSS-UPFC, which is optimized\nusing CRPSO from the literature. Firefly Algorithm is also used to present\ncoordinated tuning between PSS-UPFC, and the results will be compared with\nsystems that use PSS or UPFC only, in which the parameters have also been\noptimized. Based on load changes and three-phase fault simulation, the proposed\nUPFC-Based PI Controller is proven to be able to increase the eigenvalues of the\nsystem under different conditions and provides better results in time-domain analysis,\nby reducing overshoot, acceleration settling time, and minimizing graph area.", "Daftar File": {"Abstrak": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/207453"}, "Penulis": "Rathy Shinta Utami [23218059]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
