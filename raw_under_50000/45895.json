{"Nomor": 45895, "Judul": "Electronic Griffiths Phase in Disordered Mott-Transition Systems", "Abstrak": "Solid-state physics and soft-matter physics have been developed independently, with little mutual\nexchange of the underlying physical concepts. However, after many studies of correlated electron systems, it has been recognized that correlated electrons (especially in Mott-transition systems) in solid matter sometimes show behavior similar to \u201cstructured fluids\u201d in soft matter; that is, the electrons exhibit longlength self-organization (but without long-range order) and slow dynamics, which is inevitable for the longlength structures. The essential question is this: what condition causes such behavior in solid matter? We focused on an organic Mott-transition system and demonstrated that the electrons of this system fluctuate very slowly only when the following two factors are met simultaneously: (i) the electronic system is on the metal and Mott-insulator boundary and (ii) the system is subject to quenched disorder. This electronic state with slow dynamics under this condition can be explained by the concept of the \u201c(electronic) Griffiths phase.\u201d This concept will potentially be a key in connecting solid-state physics with soft-matter physics.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Riku Yamamot [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Tetsuya Furukawa, Kazuya Miyagawa, Takahiko Sasaki, Kazushi Kanoda, and Tetsuaki Itou"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Physics", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 124, 046404 (2020), APS", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "03 Feb 2020"}
