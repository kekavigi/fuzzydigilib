{"Nomor": 40844, "Judul": "SIMULATIONOF THE INTERFACED STRUCTURAL COMPONENT BASED ONAMULTIPLE-TIME-SCALE ALGORITHM", "Abstrak": "A multiple-time-scale algorithm is developed to numerically simulate certain struc-\ntural components in civil structures where local defects inevitably exist. Spatially, the size of\nlocal defects is relatively small compared to the structural scale. Different length scales should\nbe adopted considering the efficiency and computational cost. In the principle of physics, dif-\nferent length scales are stipulated to correspond to different time scales. This concept lays the\nfoundation of the framework for this multiple-time-scale algorithm. A multiple-time-scale algo-\nrithm, which involves different time steps for different regions, while enforcing the compatibility\nof displacement, force and stress fields across the interface, is proposed. Furthermore, a defected\nbeam component is studied as a numerical sample. The structural component is divided into two\nregions: a coarse one and a fine one; a micro-defect exists in the fine region and the finite element\nsizes of the two regions are diametrically different. Correspondingly, two different time steps are\nadopted. With dynamic load applied to the beam, stress and displacement distribution of the de-\nfected beam is investigated from the global and local perspectives. The numerical sample reflects\nthat the proposed algorithm is physically rational and computationally efficient in the potential\ndamage simulation of civil structures.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Keke Tang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xianqiao Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "multiple-time-scale algorithm, defected beam, interface, structural component, civil structures", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 27, No. 4, August, 2014", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "16 Jul 2019"}
