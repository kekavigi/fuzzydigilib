{"Nomor": 48929, "Judul": "EARLY STUDY OF HYDROGEN COMBUSTION PROCESS MODELING AND SIMULATION OF NONPREMIXED DUAL FUEL COMPRESSION ENGINE WITH HYDROGEN-DIESEL FUEL PERCENTAGE MIXTURE VARIATION", "Abstrak": "The global CO2 emission gas trend has been increasing rapidly for the last decades since the industrial revolution era and could be reduced by using renewable energy as the source of energy. Hydrogen is known because of it's safety, reliability, wide range of resources and non-polluting. Hydrogen is being used for cooling turbine engines while generating power in a power plant. Usually, there is a waste through leakage in the generator.\nThis research try to do early study to use hydrogen as fuel mixture in diesel engine of generator set in the power plant and the potency approximation in one of the power plant operation and maintenance companies in Indonesia. Simulations have been done for several hydrogen mixtures based on energy fraction, which are 0, 5, 10, 20, and 25% of the hydrogen energy fraction mixture.\nThe result shows that the addition of hydrogen mixture contributes to higher maximum pressure inside the cylinder. Analyzation of the factors that contribute to this maximum characteristics result are burning speed, lower ignition energy, ignition delays, more pronounced pre-ignition phase, and the fact that higher pressure leads to lower autoignition temperature contribute to multi effects. The limitation is not on the engine materials, but instead on NOx emission, knocking, and noise. The potency of energy saving in PT TJB Power Services is 355,939 MJ equal to 2,973.6 kg of diesel fuel or Rp33,318,651 daily.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Firman Ramadhani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/209044"}, "Penulis": "Firman Ramadhani [13116120]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr.-Ing.
