{"Nomor": 47420, "Judul": "A COMPARISON OF AGE DIFFERENCE REACTION TO COMPUTER INTERFACE", "Abstrak": "In this work, a simplified interface system for education of people with disabilities is presented. This platform allows the control of different tools (PC games, robot, and electric wheelchair) using different interfaces (mouse, joysticks, etc.). This interface system can be automatically reconfigured to match user\u2019s ability, and it is operated locally or remotely through the internet. Saving of experimental progress data for later analysis can be done. Quantitative indicators are defined for evaluation purposes and to determine the needed assistance and adaptation. The system is tested on different age groups for people without physical disability. Results are presented and discussed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Chadi Riman [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Husam Ghusn & Eric Monacelli"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Elderly.Training.Computer interface", "Sumber": "European Group for Research into Elderly and Physical Activity (EGREPA) 2010, Springer", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Mei 2020"}
