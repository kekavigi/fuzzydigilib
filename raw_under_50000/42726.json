{"Nomor": 42726, "Judul": "ForenFace: a unique annotated forensic facial image dataset and toolset", "Abstrak": "Few facial image datasets are suitable for forensic research. In this study, the authors present ForenFace, a facial image and video dataset. It contains video sequences and extracted images of 97 subjects recorded with six different surveillance camera of various types. Moreover, it also contains high-resolution images and 3D scans. The novelty of this\\ dataset lies in two aspects: (i) a subset of 435 images (87 subjects, five images per subject) has been manually annotated, yielding a very rich forensically relevant annotation of almost 19.000 facial parts, and (ii) making available a toolset to create, view, and extract the annotation. The authors present protocols and the result of a baseline experiment in which two commercial software packages and an annotated facial feature contained in this dataset are compared. The dataset, the annotation and tools are available under a usage license.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Chris G. Zeinstra [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Luuk J.
