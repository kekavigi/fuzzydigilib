{"Nomor": 41007, "Judul": "Assessment of socio-economic vulnerability under sea level rise coupled with storm surge in the Chongming County, Shanghai", "Abstrak": "The sea level rise (SLR) caused by global climate change will have a great impact on the coastal areas. This will affect significantly the socio-economic development in the region. The study of the responses of coastal systems to climate change, assessment of the effects of climate change on the coastal systems, and proposal of feasible mitigation strategies are important prerequisites for the sustainable socio-economic development., In this study, the possible impact of the SLR coupled with storm surge caused by climate change on the socioeconomic development in the region was analyzed by the Source-Pathway-Receptor-Consequence (SPRC) model using the Chongming County in the municipality of Shanghai as a case study. An index system for vulnerability assessment was developed, in which the flooding depth, population density, GDP per capita, GDP per land unit, rate of flood damage, and fiscal revenue were selected as the key indicators. A quantitative spatial assessment method based on the GIS platformwas established by quantifying each indicator and calculating and grading the vulnerability index....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Baiyang Yan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["JunWangb, Shasha Li, Lifang Cui, Zhenming Ge, Liquan Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Sea level rise, Storm surge, SPRC model, Vulnerability assessment, Chongming County", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Jul 2019"}
