{"Nomor": 40920, "Judul": "Effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, organic fertilizer and soil sterilization on maize growth", "Abstrak": "The effects of inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, organic fertilizer (F) applications, and\nsoil sterilization on maize growth were evaluated in a pot experiment. The experiment was in a completely\nrandomized factorial design (2 x 4 x 2) with six replicates for each treatment. There were two soil\ntreatments (sterilized soil, SS and unsterilized soil, US), four organic fertilizer treatments (0.0, 0.5, 1.0 and\n2.0 g kg1 soil), and two AM fungi treatments (inoculation with Glomus mosseae, +AM and uninoculated\ncontrol, AM). Inoculated plants generally had greater AM colonization, plant height, dry weight and\nphosphorus (P) uptake than uninoculated controls, and these parameters were significantly increased\nas the organic fertilizer application increased up to 0.5 g kg1 but decreased or had no significant effect\ncompared to the uninoculated plants at the highest fertilizer rate (2.0 g kg1). Plant growth, P uptake and\nAM colonization of root system were significantly higher in sterilized soil compared to the unsterilized\ncontrol. Our results indicated that the inoculation of AM fungi in field soil with optimal organic fertilizer\napplication greatly improved maize growth and nutrient uptake, and the effect was greater under\nsterilized soil condition.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Gui-Yun Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Li-Ping Zhang, Ming-Feng Wei, Zhen Liu, Qiao-Lan Fan, Qi-Rong Shen, Guo-Hua Xu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Zea mays L, AM fungi, Organic fertilizer, Soil sterilization, Plant growth AM colonization", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Jul 2019"}
