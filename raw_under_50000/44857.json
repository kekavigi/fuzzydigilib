{"Nomor": 44857, "Judul": "Evaluation Of Shale Fracture Toughness Based On Micrometer Indentation Test", "Abstrak": "It is an important mechanical parameter for fracture toughness that affects hydraulic fracturing. Some\nmethods such as indoor test core and logging data interpretation are commonly used to obtain fracture\ntoughness. These methods, however, have their own limitations. Liu's method has focused the mechanical properties of shale including fracture toughness based on micro-/nano-indentation experiments. Zeng's method has pointed that the former method of calculating fracture toughness ignores the\nmaximum holding stage in the indentation-displacement curves, they point out and correct the fracture\nstress intensity factor model, but the final calculation of the fracture toughness of the numerical difference is of two orders of magnitude. In this paper, micro-indentation experiments were carried out to\nfurther analyze and correct the model by collecting and analyzing Longmaxi shale cuttings. After Zeng\nand Liu's methods are combined, the irreversible elastic energy by energy area actually was measured. To\nsome extent, the difference between the two kinds of fracture toughness is reduced.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "XUE SU [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ping Chen", "Tianshou Ma"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Fracture toughness, Micro-indentation experiment, Rock mechanical properties", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 5, Issue 1, Pages 52-57 (March  2019), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.05.005", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Nov 2019"}
