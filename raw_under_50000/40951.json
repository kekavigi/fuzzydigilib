{"Nomor": 40951, "Judul": "Relationship between temporal\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdspatial distribution of fishing grounds of bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) and thermocline characteristics in the Atlantic Ocean", "Abstrak": "We evaluated the isoline distribution of thermocline characteristics (the upper and lower boundary temperatures\nand depths) in the bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) fishing grounds in the tropical Atlantic Ocean.\nWe plotted the thermocline characteristics contour on a spatial overlay map using data collected on a\nmonthly basis from Argo buoys and monthly CPUE (catch per unit effort) from bigeye tuna long-lines\nfrom the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). In addition, frequency\nanalysis and the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) were used to calculate the optimum\nranges of thermocline characteristics of the central fishing grounds. Our analysis suggested that there\nwere significant seasonal variations in the upper boundary temperature and depth of thermocline in the\ncentral fishing grounds, which significantly influenced the temporal and spatial distribution of the bigeye\ntuna population. The overlay maps suggest that the central fishing ground of the bigeye tuna is located\nin the enclosed curve region between the higher value (70 m) and the lower value (40 m) of the upper\nboundary depth, from December to March of each year. After that, the fishing grounds spread to the north\nand south on both sides. CPUE is highest in areas where the upper boundary depths of the thermocline\nare between 40 and 60m to the north of the equator. This extends to between 60 and 100m to the south\nof the equator. The CPUE is highest in areas where the upper boundary temperature of the thermocline\nis between 24 and 26.9 \u00b0C in the low-latitude Atlantic Ocean, but decreases to 18 \u00b0C offshore of Namibia\nduring July to October. The overlay maps showed that the lower boundary temperature and depth of thermocline\nhave little seasonal variation. The lower boundary depth of the thermocline isoline depth showed\nthat the higher depth area (>250 m) was shaped like the letter \u2018W\u2019. Similarly, the lower boundary temperature\nof thermocline isoline depth suggests that the temperature is higher besides the equator and\nlower around the equator area. The lower boundary water depth in the central fishing ground of the bigeye\ntuna ranged between 150 m and 250 m in the low-latitude Atlantic Ocean over the year, whereas the\nCPUE was low when the depth exceeded 250 m. In addition, the lower boundary water depth in the central\nfishing ground of the bigeye tuna decreased to between 140 and 160 m offshore of Namibia from April\nto October. The lower boundary temperature in the central fishing ground was about 12 \u00b0C in the lowlatitude\nAtlantic Ocean and 14 \u00b0C offshore of Namibia. Conversely, if the temperature is >15 \u00b0C, the CPUE\ntends to be low. The numerical computation results suggest that the optimum ranges for the upper boundary\nthermocline temperature and depth were between 23 and 26.9 \u00b0C, and 30 and 70 m, respectively.\nThe optimum ranges were 12\u201314.9 \u00b0C and 150\u2013230 m for the lower boundary thermocline temperature\nand depth, respectively. We documented the distribution interval range of thermocline characteristics\nfor the central fishing ground of the bigeye tuna in the Atlantic Ocean. Our results provide a reference\nfor improving the efficiency of the bigeye tuna long-line fleet and aids tuna resource management in\nthe Atlantic Ocean.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Shenglong Yang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Junjie Ma, YumeiWu, Xiumei Fan, Shaofei Jin, Xuezhong Chen"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Thunnus obesus, Tropical Atlantic, Thermocline, Argo", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Jul 2019"}
