{"Nomor": 41038, "Judul": "Approaching Quantization in Macroscopic Quantum Spin Hall Devices through Gate Training", "Abstrak": "Quantum spin Hall edge channels hold great promise as dissipationless one-dimensional conductors.\nHowever, the ideal quantized conductance of 2e2=h is only found in very short channels-in contradiction\nwith the expected protection against backscattering of the topological insulator state. In this Letter we show\nthat enhancing the band gap does not improve quantization. When we instead alter the potential landscape\nby charging trap states in the gate dielectric using gate training, we approach conductance quantization for\nmacroscopically long channels. Effectively, the scattering length increases to 175 ?m, more than 1 order of\nmagnitude longer than in previous works for HgTe-based quantum wells. Our experiments show that the\ndistortion of the potential landscape by impurities, leading to puddle formation in the narrow gap material,\nis the major obstacle for observing undisturbed quantum spin Hall edge channel transport.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lukas Lunczer [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Philipp Leubner,", "Martin Endres,", "Valentin L.
