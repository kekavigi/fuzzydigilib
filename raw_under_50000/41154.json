{"Nomor": 41154, "Judul": "Analysis For Pressure Transient Of Coalbed Methane Reservoir Based On Laplace Transform Finite Difference Method", "Abstrak": "Based on fractal geometry, fractal medium of coalbed methane mathematical model is established\nby Langmuir isotherm adsorption formula, Fick's diffusion law, Laplace transform formula,\nconsidering the well bore storage effect and skin effect. The Laplace transform finite difference\nmethod is used to solve the mathematical model. With Stehfest numerical inversion, the distribution of dimensionless well bore flowing pressure and its derivative was obtained in real space.\nAccording to compare with the results from the analytical method, the result from Laplace transform finite difference method turns out to be accurate. The influence factors are analyzed, including\nfractal dimension, fractal index, skin factor, well bore storage coefficient, energy storage ratio,\ninterporosity flow coefficient and the adsorption factor. The calculating error of Laplace transform\ndifference method is small. Laplace transform difference method has advantages in well-test\napplication since any moment simulation does not rely on other moment results and space grid.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "LEI WANG  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hongjun Yin", "Xiaoshuang Yang", "Chuncheng Yang", "Jing Fu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Industrial oils, fats, waxes, gases", "Kata Kunci": "Coalbed methane, Pressure performance, Fractal medium, Laplace transform finite difference method", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 3, Pages 231-236 (September  2015), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.08.002", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Jul 2019"}
