{"Nomor": 44741, "Judul": "IMPROVING NATURAL DISASTER MANAGEMENT FOR INDONESIA COASTAL AREA (THE CASE OF ACEH TSUNAMI)", "Abstrak": "A natural hazard cannot be avoided and can happen in every part of the\nworld. Combining with the vulnerability of the area, this hazard can turn into a\ndisaster which causes great losses and damages. To reducing these impacts, a\ndisaster management is needed. This process can be very complicated due to the\ncomplexity of the cases. One of the most complex cases in disaster management is\nIndonesia, which experienced one of the most recent catastrophic natural disasters\nin world: the Aceh tsunami.\nTo reach the objective of the research, which is to define what natural\ndisaster management strategy can be applied for Indonesia coastal area -\nspecifically in the case of Aceh tsunami - based on theory and practice, a literature\nreview is conducted. The literature review functions to picture the shifts in\ndisaster management, both in theoretical perspective and also in the Aceh\nprovincial spatial plan (practical perspective). Moreover, it will explore basic\nstrategies in disaster management which with another results of the literature\nreview are used to gather experts\u2019 opinion on disaster management strategy for\nAceh by using Delphi Method.\nFor the disaster management strategy, this research is adopting Oosterberg\net al. disaster management strategy and adjusting it to tsunami disaster\nmanagement. The strategies becomes keep tsunami away from urban area (for\ntsunami hazard reduction), prepare urban areas for tsunami (for tsunami\nvulnerability reduction), and keep urban areas away from tsunami (for tsunami\nexposure reduction).\nTheoretically, the disaster management shifts from response management\ntowards risk management which emphasis on vulnerability reduction. This\nmanagement asked for more pro-active measures by implementing\nmultidisciplinary approach and involving partnerships in the institutional\nframework. It also requires community participation on the planning process and\ncontinuous communication with communities. Connecting this shift with the\ndisaster management strategy, \u2018prepare urban area for tsunami\u2019 is the most ideal\nstrategy in the disaster management. This strategy even promoted through Hyogo\nFramework which focusing on reducing vulnerability and increasing resilience.\nii\nPractically, after the tsunami on December 24, 2004 there is a major\nchange in the disaster management in Indonesia which also influences the Aceh\nspatial plan draft: the disaster management becomes one of the focuses in the\nspatial plan. Before, the disaster management was ignored and did not mentioned\nat all in the spatial plan. \u2018Prepare urban area for tsunami\u2019 strategy is adopted to\nreduce the vulnerability of the area. The implementation of this strategy also\ncombines with \u2018keep tsunami away from urban area\u2019 strategy. Sea walls are built\nand coastal vegetations (mangrove, coral reef, and sea grass) are planted or\nrehabilitated so that they can function as coastal green belt.\nBased on the strategies identified in the literature review (theoretical and\npractical), a Delphi questionnaire is sent to some experts related to the disaster\nmanagement in Aceh. The Delphi survey finds that most of the respondents\nchoose \u2018prepare urban area for tsunami\u2019 strategy as the most suitable strategy to\nbe applied in Aceh. This result is in line with the findings on theoretical and\nempirical review as explained before. Moreover, this strategy is also already\napplied in Aceh now even though the result is still not satisfying most of the\nexperts.\nAs conclusion, the natural disaster management strategy that can be\napplied for Indonesia coastal area - specifically in the case of Aceh tsunami -\nbased on theory and practice is \u2018prepare urban area for tsunami\u2019. However, the\n\u2018prepare urban area for tsunami\u2019 strategy cannot be implemented alone without\nthe help of the other two strategies. These three strategies must be combined to\nreach maximum goals, both for short and long term.\nThis research also recommends four things to be considered in\nimplementing the disaster management in Aceh and guidelines for the future\nresearch. First, using the big influence of Islamic value in Aceh for the\ninformation spreading and planning process. Second, increasing public\ninvolvement in the arrangement of disaster management. Third, reminding the\nAcehnese to their local value and wisdom. The last, for future research, a broader\nscope of research by involving some lesson-learned from other countries in the\nliterature review is suggested.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Fegi Nurhabni": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/187693", "2008 TS PP FEGI NURHABNI-CHAPTER 1.": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/187694", "2008 TS PP FEGI NURHABNI-CHAPTER 2.": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/187695", "2008 TS PP FEGI NURHABNI-CHAPTER 3 .": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/187696", "2008 TS PP FEGI NURHABNI-CHAPTER 4.": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/187697", "2008 TS PP FEGI NURHABNI-CHAPTER 5.": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/187699", "2008 TS PP FEGI NURHABNI-REFERENCE": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/187700"}, "Penulis": "Fegi Nurhabni [25406018]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Drs.
