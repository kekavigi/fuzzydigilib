{"Nomor": 47423, "Judul": "A COMPUTER PROGRAM FOR INTERPRETING PULMONARY ARTERY CATHETERIZATION DATA: RESULTS OF THE EUROPEAN HEMODYN RESIDENT STUD", "Abstrak": "We previously validated an expert computer program (Hemodyn) designed to assist in interpreting pulmonary artery catheterization data. The present multicentric study assessed the influence of Hemodyn on the therapeutic strategies of residents. Each resident made several diagnostic choices and suggested appropriate treatments based on pulmonary artery catheterization (PAC) data. After knowledge of the computer interpretation, the resident could either maintain or change his or her diagnosis and treatment under a senior supervision. Agreement between the residents\u2019 initial evaluation and the computer\u2019s was poor (kappa <0.6). After computer assistance, agreement improved dramatically (kappa >0.9). Computer assistance led the residents to change at least one suggested treatment in 63% of cases, and in 8% of cases the residents changed the initial suggestion to its opposite. Expert software capable of helping residents to interpret PAC data properly may improve the quality of care given to critically ill patients.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Pierre Squara  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Etienne Fourquet, Luc Jacquet, Alain Broccard, Thomas Uhlig, Andrew Rhodes, Jan Bakker, Claude Perret"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Right heart, catheterization, Hemodynamics, Medical intelligence", "Sumber": "Springer-Verlag 2003", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Mei 2020"}
