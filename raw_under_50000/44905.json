{"Nomor": 44905, "Judul": "Pseudospin symmetry restoration and the in-medium balancebetween nuclear attractive and repulsive interactions", "Abstrak": "The mechanism that restores pseudospin symmetry (PSS) is investigated under the relativistic Hartree-Fock (RHF) approach, by focusing on the in-medium balance between nuclear attractive and repulsive interactions. It is illustrated that the modelings of both the equilibrium of nuclear dynamics and the in-medium effects can be essentially changed by the ?-tensor coupling that plays the role almost fully via the Fock terms, from which the model discrepancy on the PSS restoration is verified. Specifically, the largely different density-dependent behaviors of the isoscalar coupling strengths g? and g?, deduced from the parametrization of the RHF Lagrangian PKA1, play an essential role in restoring the PSS of the high-l pseudospin doublets around the Fermi levels. Qualitatively, guidance is provided for the modeling of both the equilibrium of nuclear dynamics and the inmedium effects via the PSS restoration.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jing Geng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jia Jie Li ,", "Wen Hui Long,", "Yi Fei Niu,", "and Shi Yao Chang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW C 100, 051301(R) (2019), APS", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Nov 2019"}
