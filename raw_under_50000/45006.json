{"Nomor": 45006, "Judul": "High Efficiency Gas-Liquid Separation System For Pumped Wells", "Abstrak": "Gas-liquid separation is a very common process in industrial plants, where often high Efficiency of Gas\nSeparation (EGS) is demanded. In the upstream oil industry, gas separation is also crucial for the proper\noperation of Electrical Submergible Pumps (ESP). Recent studies report the excellent performance of a\ngravitational separator known as Inverted-Shroud separator (IS-separator). Laboratory results indicate\nthat this kind of separator can achieve total gas separation for a wide range of operation conditions under\ncontinuous two-phase flow. The original intent is to use the IS-separator for downhole gas separation in\noil production wells. However, by account of its simple design and relatively compact size, it may be\nsuitable for using in industrial plants. In this paper, we present the IS-separator in details, including\ngeometry characteristics and phenomenology. The equipment performance is also discussed. In addition,\nthe challenges related to the deep understanding of the gas separation process inside the IS-separator\nand the possible practical solutions are outlined.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "L.
