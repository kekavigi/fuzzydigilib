{"Nomor": 40921, "Judul": "Terpenoid emissions from heated needles of Pinus sylvestris and their potential influences on forest fires", "Abstrak": "It is assumed that terpenoids in biomass-derived fuels have important influences on forest fires due to\ntheir enormous flammability. The fires consuming terpenoid-rich fuels always burn violently and spread\nfast. But the mechanism how terpenoids influence occurrence and propagation of fires are little known.\nSome terpenoids are volatile organic compounds (VOC) as they are released from vegetation and litter in\nnatural environment. Hence, they contribute to the characteristic composition of the ambient air. Many\nstudies have reported terpenoid emissions in natural environment from different perspective. Nevertheless\nthere are only a few studies concerning terpenoid emissions from heated fuels. The present study\nexplored the differences in terpenoid emissions from needles of Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica under natural and heated conditions. Terpenoids were sampled on Tenax-TA and analyzed using Thermal Desorption\u2013 Gas Chromatography\u2013Mass Spectrometry (TD\u2013GC\u2013MS). The results showed that the emission rate of terpenoid from P. sylvestris in natural environment was low (0.167 lg g1 h1 DW). However, terpenoid emissions dramatically increased at the temperature of 200 C, with a major component, a-pinene.\nWithin 15 min, the emission of terpenoids emitted by heated needles was up to 16.314 lg g1 DW for\ntotal and 10.321 lg g1 DW for a-pinene. These considerable emissions of terpenoids from heated needles\nwill have great influences on occurrence and propagation of forest fires.\n 2011 Ecological Society of China.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Feng-Jun Zhao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Li-Fu Shu, Qiu-Hua Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Forest fire, Fuel, Terpenoids, Volatile organic compound,(VOC) Pinus sylvestris", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Jul 2019"}
