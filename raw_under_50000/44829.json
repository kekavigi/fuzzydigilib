{"Nomor": 44829, "Judul": "Permeability Test And Fuzzy Orthogonal Analysis Of Hydrogenated Nitrile O-Ring", "Abstrak": "In the high temperature, high pressure and high corrosive environment of the oil and gas drilling\ndownhole, the weatherability of rubber sealing material has a great influence on the production\nsafety. In order to study the important degree of every key environmental factor in downhole\ninfluencing the sealing performance of rubber sealing material, a new device of simulating\ndownhole environment is designed to test the permeability of O-ring. The sample is hydrogenated\nnitrile O-ring and orthogonal experiment method is used to do nine tests by getting three levels\nfrom temperature, pressure and CO2 volume fraction. Test adopts fuzzy orthogonal method to\nanalyze the main effects and the interaction between two factors, taking tensile strength, diameter\nvariety rate and pH value of indicator as evaluation index. The results show that: the environmental\nfactor influencing the sealing performance of hydrogenated nitrile O-ring from high to low by turns\nis temperature, pressure and CO2 volume fraction, while the interaction between temperature and\npressure is the most significant. It provides a new way to study the influence of downhole complex\nenvironment on the performance of rubber sealing material. Moreover, the results have important\nreference value to further study the failure mechanism of rubber sealing ring in many environmental factors and the rational use in engineering", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "QIN HU [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Changcheng Wan", "Changxin Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "Hydrogenated nitrile, O-ring, Permeability, Fuzzy orthogonal, Oil and gas exploration", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 1, Pages 46-50 (March  2015), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.03.003", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Nov 2019"}
