{"Nomor": 45801, "Judul": "The role of the Cu dopant on a Mn3O4 spinel SCR catalyst: Improvement of low-temperature activity and sulfur resistance", "Abstrak": "Mn-based oxides are regarded as one of the most promising catalysts for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of\nNOx by NH3 at low temperatures, but their applications are extremely restricted by the irreversible poisoning of\nSO2. Improving the SO2 tolerance of Mn-based catalyst has longtime received the most attentions from both\nacademia and industry. In this work, a series of Cu-modified Mn3O4 spinels were synthesized, and the roles of the Cu dopant were investigated.....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Shangchao Xiong [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yue Penga, Dong Wanga, Nan Huanga, Qinfang Zhangb, Shijian Yangc, Jianjun Chena, Junhua Lia"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Poisoning of SO2, low temperature SCR, Cu doping, Spinel, SO2 tolerance", "Sumber": "Chemical Engineering Journal journal, www.elsevier.com/locate/cej", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Jan 2020"}
