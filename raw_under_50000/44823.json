{"Nomor": 44823, "Judul": "Confined Compressive Strength Model Of Rock For Drilling Optimization", "Abstrak": "The confined compressive strength (CCS) plays a vital role in drilling optimization. On the basis of\nJizba's experimental results, a new CCS model considering the effects of the porosity and nonlinear\ncharacteristics with increasing confining pressure has been developed. Because the confining\npressure plays a fundamental role in determining the CCS of bottom-hole rock and because the\ntheory of Terzaghi's effective stress principle is founded upon soil mechanics, which is not suitable\nfor calculating the confining pressure in rock mechanics, the double effective stress theory, which\ntreats the porosity as a weighting factor of the formation pore pressure, is adopted in this study. The\nnew CCS model combined with the mechanical specific energy equation is employed to optimize\nthe drilling parameters in two practical wells located in Sichuan basin, China, and the calculated\nresults show that they can be used to identify the inefficient drilling situations of underbalanced\ndrilling (UBD) and overbalanced drilling (OBD).", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "XIANGCHAO SHI  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yingfeng Meng", "Gao Li", "Jiaxue Li", "Zuwen Tao", "Shandong Wei"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Confined compressive strength, Drilling optimization, Rate of penetration, Mechanical specific energy", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 1, Pages 31-39 (March  2015),    http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.03.002", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Nov 2019"}
