{"Nomor": 46160, "Judul": "ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY, UNPLUGGED: IMAGING MEMBRANE POTENTIAL WITH FLUORESCENT INDICATORS", "Abstrak": "Membrane potential is a fundamental\nbiophysical property maintained by every cell on earth. In\nspecialized cells like neurons, rapid changes in membrane\npotential drive the release of chemical neurotransmitters.\nCoordinated, rapid changes in neuronal membrane potential\nacross large numbers of interconnected neurons form the\nbasis for all of human cognition, sensory perception, and\nmemory. Despite the importance of this highly orchestrated\nand distributed activity, the traditional method for recording\nmembrane potential is through the use of highly invasive\nsingle-cell electrodes that offer only a small glimpse of the\ntotal activity within a system. Fluorescent dyes that change their optical properties in response to changes in biological voltage have the potential to provide a powerful complement to traditional electrode-based methods of inquiry. Voltage-sensitive fluorescent indicators would allow the direct observation of membrane potential changes, significantly expanding our ability to monitor membrane potential dynamics in living systems.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Pei Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Evan W.
