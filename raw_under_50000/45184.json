The\nproposed model quantifes wave propagation in the oil feld development process as VSP, transient well tests, and seismic\nproduction technology. Porosity variation, fuid\u2013solid compressibility, and pseudo-threshold pressure gradient in low permeability reservoir are simultaneously considered, resulting in a modifed form of continuity and motion equations. Integrating\nthe equations and decomposition for the fuid\u2013solid displacements helps to derive the analytical wave vectors of the fast P,\nslow P, and S waves in porous media. The sensitivity of afecting factors, such as petrophysical parameter, fuid property,\nand vibration frequency, on the wave velocity and attenuation is subsequently evaluated. Furthermore, the Biot model can be\nconsidered a special situation when the initial fow rate in this model tends to zero. The increase in initial percolating rate,\nexpressed by the ratio of initial fow rate and solid scalar potential, causes an obvious decrease in the fast P wave velocity\nand an increase in its quality factor. Propagation of the slow P wave and the S wave is scarcely infuenced. Low vibration\nfrequency and low permeability also contribute to a large diference between the wave propagation parameters of the improved\nand Biot models. Cognition of the proportion in the inertia and viscosity efects is helpful in analyzing the complicated\nmultiple mechanisms in wave propagation in the actual developed layer.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "XIAODONG HAN [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Liming Zheng", "Cunliang Chen", "Hongfu Shi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Seismic production technology, Biot poroelastic model, Velocity, Attenuation, Initial percolation", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Exploration and Production Technology, Volume 8, Issue 4, 1079-1088 (December 2018), https://doi.org/10.1007/s13202-018-0468-x", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Nov 2019"}
