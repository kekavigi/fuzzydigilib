{"Nomor": 46012, "Judul": "MODULAR ARITHMETIC WITH NODAL LINES: DRUMHEAD SURFACE STATES IN ZRSITE", "Abstrak": "We study the electronic structure of the nodal line semimetal ZrSiTe both experimentally and\ntheoretically. We find two different surface states in ZrSiTe\u2014topological drumhead surface states and\ntrivial floating band surface states, which can be easily distinguished in ARPES experiments. Using the\nspectra of Wilson loops, we show that a nontrivial Berry phase that exists in a confined region within the\nBrillouin zone gives rise to the topological drumhead-type surface states. The Z2 structure of the Berry\nphase induces a Z2 \u201cmodular arithmetic\u201d of the surface states, allowing surface states derived from different nodal lines to hybridize and gap out, which can be probed by a set of Wilson loops. Our findings are confirmed by ab initio calculations and angle-resolved photoemission experiments, which are in excellent agreement with each other and the topological analysis. This work is the first complete characterization of topological surface states in the family of square-net-based nodal line semimetals, and thus it fundamentally increases the understanding of the topological nature of this growing class of topological semimetals.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lukas Muechler [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Andreas Topp, Raquel Queiroz, Maxim Krivenkov, Andrei Varykhalov, Jennifer Cano, Christian R.
