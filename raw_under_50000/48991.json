{"Nomor": 48991, "Judul": "STUDY OF PATTERN WATER INJECTION IN LOW RESISTIVITY AND LOW CONTRAST RESERVOIR WITH HORIZONTAL WELL", "Abstrak": "This study discusses methods to develop low resistivity, low contrast (LRLC) formation in Indonesia. LRLC\nformations were found throughout Talang Akar formation but were initially interpreted as non-productive formations.\nThis study focuses on the development of LRLC zones, through the use of horizontal well, 5-spot well patern and\nwater injection, these zones could be developed economically.\nReservoir simulation is conducted on field X within 20 years of production period to forecast how effective horizontal\nwell and water injection to improve the oil recovery factor in a low permeability reservoir. Thus, sensitivity studies\nwere created to find the optimum recovery factor by varying operational parameter (i.e., water injection rates). The\nauthor varies the water injection rate from 500 bbl/d to 3000 bbl/d. Those numbers are chosen because the initial total\nproduction oil rate is 2000 bbl/d.\nAfter the reservoir simulation has been done in CMG, the base case without water injection results cumulative oil\nproduction for 20 years is 993.67 MSTB (Recovery Factor = 46%) for one pattern. For the best technical is with 2000\nbbl/d water injection rate which produces 1322.07 MSTB (Recovery Factor = 61.24%). The most profitable scenario\nis also acquired when the water injection rate is 2000 bbl/d. This scenario could give the Net Present Value at a 10\npercent discount rate of $ 18,309,909.71 and IRR of 54%.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Jay Bianco Sembiring Meliala": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/209137"}, "Penulis": "Jay Bianco Sembiring Meliala [12216076]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ardhi Hakim Lumban Gaol, S.T., M.T., M.Si., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Low Resistivity , Low Contrast, Horizontal Well, 5-Spot Well Patern and Water Injection", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Agu 2020"}
