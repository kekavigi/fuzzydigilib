{"Nomor": 41261, "Judul": "ASYMPTOTIC SOLUTIONS OF MODE I STEADY GROWTH CRACK IN MATERIALS UNDER CREEP CONDITIONS", "Abstrak": "An asymptotic analysis is made on problems with a steady-state crack growth cou-\npled with a creep law model under tensile loads. Asymptotic equations of crack tip fields in creep\nmaterials are derived and solved numerically under small scale conditions. Stress and strain func-\ntions are adopted under a polar coordinate system. The governing equations of asymptotic fields\nare obtained by inserting the stress field and strain field into the material law. The crack growth\nrate rather than fracture criterion plays an important role in the crack tip fields of materials with\ncreep behavior.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Qinghua Meng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zhenqing Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "asymptotic analysis, steady-state growth, small scale conditions, creep materials I.
