The seedlings were submitted to four treatments:\n(1) 40 seedlings unflooded and watered daily as control (Unflooded, CK); (2) 120 seedlings flooded\nat 1 cm above the ground level (F-1 cm); (3) 120 seedlings flooded at 12 cm above the ground level\n(F-12 cm) and (4) 120 seedlings completely submerged with 2 m water depth (F-2 m, top of plants at\n2 m below water surface)....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Li Xiaoling [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Li Ning, Yang Jin, Ye Fuzhou, Chen Faju, Chen Fangqing"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Distylium chinense, Three Gorges Reservoir Region, Simulated flooding", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect, Acta Ecologica Sinica 31 (2011) 31\u201339", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Agu 2019"}
