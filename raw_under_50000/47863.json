{"Nomor": 47863, "Judul": "THE INFLUENCE OF MECHANICAL PRESSURE ON SOLID-SOLID INTERFACE BASED ON PARTIAL DISCHARGE MONITORING AND LEAKAGE CURRENT MEASUREMENT UNDER DC VOLTAGE", "Abstrak": "The increased penetration of renewable energy sources in power systems is leading to an extensive use of\nHVDC cable systems. The weak points of cable systems, HVDC or HVAC, are the accessories, and in\nparticular the solid/solid interfaces. In this paper, experiments conducted to investigate the electric\ncharacteristic (DC breakdown voltage, DC leakage current and DC partial discharge monitoring) of\nsolid/solid interfaces are reported. The results seem to indicate that mechanisms not related to partial\ndischarges are not the root cause for breakdown. Unlike partial discharge monitoring where the appearance\nof partial discharge only occurs shortly before the breakdown, leakage current measurement always gives\nvalue to each level of observation.", "Daftar File": {"Abstrak": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/207407"}, "Penulis": "Eko Yulianto [23218037]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
