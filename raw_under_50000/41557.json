{"Nomor": 41557, "Judul": "DESIGN OF MUON DETECTOR BASED ON PLASTIC SCINTILLATOR FOR THE COSINE-100 DARK MATTER EXPERIMENT", "Abstrak": "Number of astronomical observations suggest that the dominant matter in the universe is\nnon-baryonic dark matter. However, the searches for dark matter has been one of the most\nchallenging research topics in physics. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are\npromising candidates of dark matter, supporting by many astronomical considerations and\ntheoretical predictions. Many of direct dark matter experiments are looking for WIMP dark\nmatter by using various detection techniques and technologies. But one exceptional, DAMA\ngroup reported over 20 years of annual modulation signal using NaI(Tl) crystal scintillation\ndetectors. They claim that this signal is WIMP-like signal in their detectors. However, no\nexperiments can prove the signal with set limits which are incompatible with DAMA result.\nAn experiment is needed with same target material detector to resolve both result without\nconflict. COSINE-100 is a joint effort experiment by the KIMS-NaI (Korean Invisible Mass\nSearch) and the DM-Ice with a goal to reproduce or refute the annual modulation signature\nreported by DAMA group using Thallium-doped Sodium Iodide crystal scintillations.\nCOSINE-100 experiment is operating and located at the Yangyang Underground Laboratory\n(Y2L) in South Korea. The construction and assembly process was completed in the Summer\nof 2016 and the detector is currently collecting physics data. During the operation, several\nthings needed to be considered are backgrounds level including from the cosmic-ray showers.\nIn rare event searches, cosmic-ray muons can produce seasonal modulation of event which\ncould mimic weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) signal in nuclear recoils. DAMA\ngroup did not have muon tag system that they did not study cosmic-ray seasonal modulation\neffect. To tag the muon-events and study the correlations between muon and crystal-events,\nCOSINE-100 has installed the muon detectors in the outside shielding structure. An array of\n3-cm thick plastic scintillator panels surrounds the crystal detector in all sides. This work\nfocuses on the design, construction and assembly process, data analysis of the COSINE-100\ndetector, with particular emphasis on muon-modulation. Muons, identified by a selection\ncriteria, are developed with a coincidence technique and time difference between two panels.\nA coincidence and threshold are used to remove gamma-backgrounds at low energy and\nshowed the muon-like events in high energy region. The threshold is set to be different for each\nside detector. A time difference cut has been developed to reduce fake-event in signal area.\nThe muon coincident signal should be in close time-range of the gap. The time correlation\nobserved for the muon candidate events, a signal range of -100ns < DT < 115ns. Considering\nthe background distribution, the background contamination in the signal region is calculated to\nbe 0.3 %. Furthermore, the muon selection efficiency was estimated to be 99.9 \u00b1 0.1 % when\nthe charge threshold cuts are applied. A similar muon selection technique is applied for all pairs\nof different sides to tag muon candidate events. Muon events were found with direct or prompt\nenergy deposition > 4 MeV. Muons can also induce low energy phosphorescence event in\ncrystals which can mimic WIMP signal with a confined modulation signature. An event\nselection for crystal study has been used by rejecting 30 ms from a muon hit in plastic\nscintillator. It gives approximately 0.1 % deadtime for data taking in the detector. This rejection\nis used in crystal analysis to prevent large number of accidental events. With 2 years of physics\ndata, an annual modulation behaviour has been observed with an amplitude of (0.51 \u00b1 0.24) %\nand a phase of (182 \u00b1 25) d corresponding to a maximum on the 30th of June Using the\natmospheric temperature data, we studied the correlation between muon and temperature\nmodulation with a positive correlation. With an effective coefficient alpha_{T} = 0.815 \u00b1\n0.097. This result represents the study of the muon flux modulation for Y2L site and is in good\nagreement with theoretically expectations.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Hafizh Prihtiadi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180858", "BAB 1 Hafizh Prihtiadi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180859", "BAB 2 Hafizh Prihtiadi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180860", "BAB 3 Hafizh Prihtiadi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180861", "BAB 4 Hafizh Prihtiadi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180862", "BAB 5 Hafizh Prihtiadi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180863", "PUSTAKA Hafizh Prihtiadi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180864", "ABSTRAK Hafizh Prihtiadi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/181794"}, "Penulis": "Hafizh Prihtiadi [30214010]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr.-Ing.
