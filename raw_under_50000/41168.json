{"Nomor": 41168, "Judul": "STRUCTURALAND ACOUSTIC RESPONSE OFA FINITE STIFFENED CONICAL SHELL", "Abstrak": "In this paper, a precise transfer matrix method is presented to calculate the structural\nand acoustic responses of the conical shell. The governing equations of conical shells are\nwritten as a coupled set of first order differential equations. The field transfer matrix of the shell\nand non-homogenous term resulting from the external excitation are obtained by precise integration\nmethod. After assembling the field transfer matrixes, the whole matrix describing dynamic\nbehavior of the stiffened conical shell is obtained. Then the structural and acoustic responses of\nthe shell are solved by obtaining unknown sound pressure coefficients. The natural frequencies\nof the shell are compared with the FEM results to test the validity. Furthermore, the effects of\nthe semi-vertex angle, driving force directions and boundary conditions on the structural and\nacoustic responses are studied.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xianzhong Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Weiguo Wu, Xiongliang Yao"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "conical shell, precise transfer matrix method, sound radiation, stiffener", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 2, April, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Jul 2019"}
