{"Nomor": 44602, "Judul": "Understanding the Earth Systems: Expressions of Dynamic and Cyclic Thinking Among University Students", "Abstrak": "In this two-part study, we examine undergraduate university students\u2019 expression of two important\nsystem thinking characteristics\u2014dynamic thinking and\ncyclic thinking\u2014focusing particularly on students of geology. The study was conducted using an Earth systems\nquestionnaire designed to elicit and reflect either dynamic\nor cyclic thinking. The study\u2019s first part was quantitative.\nIts population consisted of a research group (223 students\nmajoring in geology or physical geography) and a control\ngroup (312 students with no background in geology). The\nstudents were asked to rate their agreement with each\nstatement on a Likert scale. Overall, the students in the\nresearch group expressed higher levels of dynamic thinking\nthan those in the control group. The geology students\nshowed relatively strong dynamic thinking toward the\ngeosphere and hydrosphere, but not the biosphere. In cyclic\nthinking, their levels were significantly higher for all Earth\nsystems, suggesting a connection between learning about\ndifferent cycles in Earth systems, developing cyclic\nthinking and applying it to other Earth cycles. The second\npart was qualitative and administered only to the students\nwho majored in geology. They were asked to freely explain\ntheir answers to the questionnaire\u2019s statements. Our aim\nwas to identify recurring patterns in how these students\nexpress their dynamic and cyclic thinking. Their explanations were given to four experts in the field of Earth science, who then presented, in a semi-structured interview,\nthe recurring characteristics of dynamic thinking that they\nfound in the students\u2019 explanations.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Or Batzri [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Orit Ben Zvi Assaraf    \u2022 Carmit Cohen   \u2022 Nir Orion"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Earth sciences", "Kata Kunci": "System thinking  Earth system  Geoscience education  Higher education", "Sumber": "Journal of Science Education and Technology; New York Vol. 24, Iss. 6,  (Dec 2015): 761-775.", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Okt 2019"}
