{"Nomor": 45256, "Judul": "Laboratory Investigation Of Gas Permeability And Its Impact on CBM Potential", "Abstrak": "Gas permeability is an important characteristic of coal seam(s) to determine the economic success of CH4 extraction and\nCO2 sequestration. There exists no comprehensive approach to predict the mechanical behaviour during CH4 extraction,\nand CO2 sequestration as coal is highly heterogeneous. Exhaustive laboratory experimentation is often the only approach to\nsuccessfully predict its behaviour. Coal experiences triaxial stress conditions when change of force feld occurs. This paper\npresents the mechanical properties and change in gas permeability at varying confning as well as gas pressures in a triaxial\nexperimental set-up using Darcy\u2019s approach. Mutual relations between permeability, in situ confning pressure as well as\ngas pressure have been established statistically. A reservoir simulation investigation has been carried out to predict the rate\nof coal bed methane (CBM) production and the cumulative amount of CBM over the 5-year life of production well.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "HARINANDAN KUMAR [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["M.
