{"Nomor": 46121, "Judul": "NONVIRAL GENE DELIVERY WITH CATIONIC GLYCOPOLYMERS", "Abstrak": "The field of gene therapy, which aims to treat patients by modulating gene expression, has come to fruition and has landed several landmark FDA approvals. Most gene therapies currently rely on viral vectors to deliver nucleic acid cargo into cells, but there is significant interest in moving toward chemical-based methods, such as polymer-based vectors, due to their low cost, immunocompatibility, and tunability. The full potential of polymer-based delivery systems has yet to be realized, however, because most polymeric transfection reagents are either too inefficient or too toxic for use in the clinic. In this Account, we describe developments in carbohydrate-based cationic polymers, termed glycopolymers, for enhanced nonviral gene delivery. As ubiquitous components of biological systems, carbohydrates are a rich class of compounds that can be harnessed to improve the biocompatibility of non-native polymers, such as linear polyamines used for promoting transfection. Reineke et al. developed a new class of carbohydrate-based polymers called poly(glycoamidoamine)s (PGAAs) by step-growth polymerization of linear monosaccharides with linear ethyleneamines. These glycopolymers were shown to be both efficient and biocompatible transfection reagents. Systematic modifications of the structural components of the PGAA system revealed structure?activity relationships important to its function, including its ability to degrade in situ.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Craig Van Bruggen [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Joseph K.
