Over the last 3 decades, RT has been at\nthe forefront of HIV drug discovery efforts with numerous\nnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and nonnucleoside\nreverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) approved\nby the FDA. However, all these RT inhibitors target\nonly the pol function, and inhibitors of RT-associated RNase\nH have yet to enter the development pipeline ....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lei Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Stefan G.
