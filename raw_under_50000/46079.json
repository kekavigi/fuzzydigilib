{"Nomor": 46079, "Judul": "CORE?SHELL NANOSTRUCTURE-ENHANCED RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY FOR SURFACE CATALYSIS", "Abstrak": "The rational design of highly efficient catalysts relies\non understanding their structure?activity relationships and reaction\nmechanisms at a molecular level. Such an understanding can be\nobtained by in situ monitoring of dynamic reaction processes using\nsurface-sensitive techniques. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy\n(SERS) can provide rich structural information with ultrahigh surface\nsensitivity, even down to the single-molecule level, which makes it a\npromising tool for the in situ study of catalysis. However, only a few\nmetals (like Au, Ag, and Cu) with particular nanostructures can\ngenerate strong SERS effects. Thus, it is almost impossible to employ\nSERS to study transition metals (like Pt, Pd, Ru, etc.) and other\nnonmetal materials that are usually used in catalysis (material\nlimitation). Furthermore, SERS is also unable to study model single ...", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hua Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Petar M.
