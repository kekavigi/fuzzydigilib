{"Nomor": 46086, "Judul": "SELF-ASSEMBLED EXTENDED ??SYSTEMS FOR SENSING AND SECURITY APPLICATIONS", "Abstrak": "Molecules and materials derived from selfassembled\nextended ?-systems have strong and reversible optical\nproperties, which can be modulated with external stimuli such as\ntemperature, mechanical stress, ions, the polarity of the medium,\nand so on. In many cases, absorption and emission responses of\nself-assembled supramolecular ?-systems are manifested several\ntimes higher when compared with the individual molecular\nbuilding blocks. These properties of molecular assemblies\nencourage scientists to have a deeper understanding of their\ndesign to explore them for suitable optoelectronic applications.\nTherefore, it is important to bring in highly responsive optical\nfeatures in ?-systems, for which it is necessary to modify their ...", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Vakayil K.
