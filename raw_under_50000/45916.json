{"Nomor": 45916, "Judul": "Topological and Subsystem Codes on Low-Degree Graphs with Flag Qubits", "Abstrak": "In this work we introduce two code families, which we call the heavy-hexagon code and the heavysquare\ncode. Both code families are implemented by assigning physical data and ancilla qubits to both\nvertices and edges of low-degree graphs. Such a layout is particularly suitable for superconducting qubit\narchitectures to minimize frequency collisions and cross talk. In some cases, frequency collisions can be\nreduced by several orders of magnitude. The heavy-hexagon code is a hybrid surface and Bacon-Shor code mapped onto a (heavy-) hexagonal lattice, whereas the heavy-square code is the surface code mapped onto a (heavy-) square lattice. In both cases, the lattice includes all the ancilla qubits required for fault-tolerant error correction. Naively, the limited qubit connectivity might be thought to limit the error-correcting capability of the code to less than its full distance. Therefore, essential to our construction is the use of flag qubits. We modify minimum-weight perfect-matching decoding to efficiently and scalably incorporate information from measurements of the flag qubits and correct up to the full code distance while respecting the limited connectivity. Simulations show that high threshold values for both codes can be obtained using our decoding protocol. Further, our decoding scheme can be adapted to other topological code families.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Christopher Chamberland [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Guanyu Zhu, Theodore J.
