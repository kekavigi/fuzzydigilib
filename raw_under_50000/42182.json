{"Nomor": 42182, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT OF TRIVALENT RARE EARTH ION (Sm3+, Dy3+, AND Nd3+) DOPED FLUOROBOROTELLURITE GLASSES FOR PHOTONICS APPLICATION", "Abstrak": "Nowadays, trivalent rare-earth (RE3+) ion-doped glasses have given more attention due to their photonic device applications such as LED, laser, display, optical sensor, optical amplifier, etc. Many various combinations of glass and modifier were developed and investigated as the host matrix for RE3+ ion. However, the proper constituent of glass medium still challenging to be more observed to increase their properties for the advanced application. Therefore, the aim of the research is to find the appropriate glass composition. We developed the RE3+ ion-doped glasses using melt and quenching method with composition of (30-x)TeO2+30B2O3+10ZnF2+30BaO+xRE2O3 where x = 0.00, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 mol% and RE2O3 is Sm2O3, Dy2O3, and Nd2O3. They were melted at 1150 0C for 1.5 hours and annealed at 500 0C for 1.5 hours. The results show the properties of a glass sample were improved by the addition of RE3+ ion and possess different optimum concentration. The efficiency of BTZFDy1.00, BTZFSm1.00, and BTZFNd0.500 glass is 81, 81, 91, and 14%, respectively. The addition of fluoride like ZnF2 can reduce the OH content in the glass structure. As consequence, the absorption and luminescence intensity, efficiency and lasing parameter of BTZFDy1.00 and BTZFSm1.00 glass increase due to the reduction of OH content. From, the analysis of all results, the developed glass mediums possess the high potential to be developed as optical gain medium in photonic devices such as an LED, display, and laser application. From Nd:YAG laser system, emission of BTZNd0.5 glasses is stronger than Nd:borate and lower than Nd:phosphate.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Lia Yuliantini": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/181254", "COVER Lia Yuliantini": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/181283", "BAB 1 Lia Yuliantini": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/181284", "BAB 2 Lia Yuliantini": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/181285", "BAB 3 Lia Yuliantini": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/181286", "BAB 4 Lia Yuliantini": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/181287", "BAB 5 Lia Yuliantini": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/181288", "PUSTAKA Lia Yuliantini": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/181289"}, "Penulis": "Lia Yuliantini [30216309]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr.-Ing.
