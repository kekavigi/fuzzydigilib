{"Nomor": 46413, "Judul": "EXCITED-BAND BLOCH OSCILLATIONS FOR PRECISION ATOM INTERFEROMETRY", "Abstrak": "We propose and demonstrate a method to increase the momentum separation between the arms of an atom interferometer and thus its area and measurement precision, by using Bloch oscillations (BOs) in an excited band of a pulsed optical standing-wave lattice. Using excited bands allows us to operate at particular \u201cmagic\u201d depths, where high momentum-transfer efficiency (>99.4% per \u00afhk, where \u00afhk is the photon momentum) is maintained while minimizing the lattice-induced phase fluctuations (<1mrad per \u00afhk) that are unavoidable in ground-band BOs.We apply thismethod to demonstrate interferometry with up to 40\u00afhk momenta supplied by BOs.We discuss extensions of this technique to larger momentum transfer and adaptations towards metrological applications of atom interferometry such as a measurement of the fine-structure constant.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Katherine E.
