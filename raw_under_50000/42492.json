The U.S. Copyright Act of 1976 has\nnot kept pace with advances in technology, creating a whole new\nset of concerns as to what constitutes fair use for libraries. Smith\nreviews the fair use analysis for four of the eight principles identified\nin the Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Academic and\nResearch Libraries and concludes with his own set of solutions to\nend the conflict: stop giving up copyright for scholarly works; help\nuniversities develop new promotion and tenure procedures, especially\nfor digital scholarship; and publish in open access venues or\nretain rights and self-archive.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Kevin Smith [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Susan Davis"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Library & information sciences", "Kata Kunci": "copyright, fair use, best practices, digital scholarship, risk analysis, self-archiving", "Sumber": "The Serials Librarian, 64:1-4, 57-66", "Staf Input/Edit": "hidayat", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Sep 2019"}
