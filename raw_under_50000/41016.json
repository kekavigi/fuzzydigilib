{"Nomor": 41016, "Judul": "Estimating air temperature of an alpine meadow on the Northern Tibetan Plateau using MODIS land surface temperature", "Abstrak": "Meteorological data are scarce due to lack of meteorology stations in the Qinghai\u2013Tibet Plateau. This\noften results in an imprecise estimation of air temperature. A linear estimation of air temperature of\nan alpine meadow on Northern Tibetan Plateau at heights of 1.5 m\u20132.1 m by using MODIS land surface\ntemperature (LST) data was conducted in this study. The results showed that linear estimation of daily\nmaximum and daytime mean air temperatures from MODIS LST data were not accurate enough\n(P > 0.01, R2 < 0.10) during the growing season. In contrast, the linear relationships between daily maximum\nand daytime mean air temperature and MODIS LST during the non-growing season were both significant\n(P < 0.01, R2 > 0.40). MODIS LST data were accurate enough to linearly estimate daily minimum\nand nighttime mean air temperatures (P < 0.01, R2 > 0.55). Moreover, derived LST from MODIS/Terra platform\n(MOD11A2) had higher accuracies than derived LST from MODIS/Aqua platform (MYD11A2) in linearly\nestimating air temperatures mentioned above.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Gang Fu  [=]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zhenxi Shen, Xianzhou Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Air temperature, Land surface temperature, MODIS, Alpine meadow, Northern Tibetan Plateau", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Jul 2019"}
