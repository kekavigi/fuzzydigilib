{"Nomor": 44690, "Judul": "A Method for Optimizing the Phased Development of Rail Transit Lines", "Abstrak": "This paper develops a method for optimizing\nthe construction phases for rail transit line extension projects with the objective of maximizing the net present\nworth and examines the economic feasibility of such\nextension projects under various financial constraints (i.e.,\nunconstrained, revenue-constrained, and budget-constrained cases). A Simulated Annealing algorithm is used\nfor solving this problem. Rail transit projects may be\ndivided into several phases due to budget limits or demand\ngrowth that justifies different sections at different times. A\nmathematical model is developed to optimize these phases\nfor a simple, one-route rail transit system, running from a\nCentral Business District (CBD) to a suburban area. Some\ninteresting results indicate that the economic feasibility of\nlinks with low demand is affected by the completion time\nof those links and their demand growth rate after their\nimplementation. Sensitivity analysis explores the effects of\ninterest rates on optimized results (i.e., construction phases\nand objective value). With further development, such a\nmethod should be useful to transportation planners and\ndecision-makers in optimizing construction phases for rail\ntransit line extension projects.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Wei-Chen Cheng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Paul Schonfeld"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering of railroads & roads", "Kata Kunci": "Rail transit  Phased development Optimization  Simulated annealing  Net present worth", "Sumber": "Urban Rail Transit (2015) 1(4):227\u2013237", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Okt 2019"}
