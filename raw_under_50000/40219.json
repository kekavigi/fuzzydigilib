{"Nomor": 40219, "Judul": "MODELING, SIMULATION, AND PREVENTION OF JULY 23, 2018 SOUTHEAST SUMATRA POWER SYSTEM BLACKOUT", "Abstrak": "Power systems across the globe suffer from blackouts at times, which tend\nto become recurrent phenomena. The incident is triggered by an initiating\ndisturbance, which causes cascading events, leading to blackouts. Learning and\nanalyzing blackouts in the real world can play a very important role in avoiding\nsuch events. In this paper, the experience of Indonesia's Southeast Sumatra\nblackout on July 23, 2018 is studied and presented. The blackout is reproduced\nand simulated, then validated with actual data. The root cause of the blackout is\nanalyzed. Finally, corrective actions such as PSS design with tuned parameters\nand transmission system operation in meshed configuration are modeled and\nsimulated, which yield satisfactory results in preventing similar blackouts in the\nfuture.", "Daftar File": {"Abstract": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/173839"}, "Penulis": "Agustriadi [23217140]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr.-Ing.
