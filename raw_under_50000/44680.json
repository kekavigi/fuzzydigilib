{"Nomor": 44680, "Judul": "Vertical Dynamic Responses of the Cantilever Deck of a Long-Span Continuous Bridge and the Coupled Moving Trains", "Abstrak": "t It may be necessary to arrange railway traffic on\nthe outer edge of the cantilever deck of a box girder bridge\nfor the sake of transportation planning. A continuous box\ngirder bridge was designed in China to carry a single-track\nurban rail transit traffic on the cantilever deck of the bridge\nand three-lane highway traffic on the other part of the deck.\nIn order to investigate the possible resonant responses of\nthe coupled train\u2013bridge system, the resonance condition of\nthe cantilever deck under moving train loads is discussed\nanalytically, and then numerical analyses of the vertical\ntrain\u2013bridge dynamic interaction considering local vibration of the cantilever decks are carried out. The degrees of\nfreedom of the bridge modeled by shell elements are so\nlarge that mode superposition method is used to reduce the\ncomputation efforts. It is found that the resonance speed of\nthe cantilever deck predicted by the analytical method is\n305 km/h, which agrees well with the numerical result. The\nnumerically computed results also indicate that the serviceability of the bridge deck and the ride quality of the\nrailway vehicles in the vertical direction are in good condition below the critical speed of 200 km/h.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Qi Li1  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Qi Wu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering of railroads & roads", "Kata Kunci": "Cantilever deck  Resonance  Local vibration Train\u2013bridge interaction", "Sumber": "Urban Rail Transit (2018) 4(2):86\u201397", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Okt 2019"}
