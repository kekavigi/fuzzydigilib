{"Nomor": 48423, "Judul": "DESAIN DAN OPTIMASI PRIMER UNTUK PENGEMBANGAN KIT DIAGNOSTIK DETEKSI HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS (HPV) SKRIPSI SARJANA", "Abstrak": "Human Papillomavirus or HPV is a virus which infected human at basal epitel mucosal. Based on its epidemiology, this virus is divided into 2 regions that are Low Risk which caused lesion and High Risk which can lead to cervical cancer. Based on its subtype, HPV has many subtypes, but HPV subtype 16,18, and 52 caused cervical cancer. HPV subtype 16 and 18 has known globally but HPV subtype 52 spread mostly in Asia include Indonesia. HPV screening is a method to identify a lesion which can lead to cervical cancer or not. In Indonesia, most of HPV screening test using Cytology test rather than molecular test. Although, molecular test can distinguish better than cytology test. Because of that, the purpose of this research is to design and optimize primer for development kit detection of HPV infection. L1 gene which conduct the capsid protein would be the amplified region using PCR method. Primer is designed using public domain such as Primer Blast, Oligoanalyzer, and dna.utah. Primer then confirmed using plasmid that consist L1 gene in its insert. The plasmid consist L1 gene form HPV16 and HPV52 that has been transformed into Escherichia coli DH5?. From this research, we know that primer sucessfuly designed as L1 HPV forward 5- AGGATGGTGACATGGTGGA-3 and L1 HPV reverse 5- CATTCGCAAGTAGTCTGGATA-3, the annealing temperature is 55\u00b0C for HPV52. The amplification result is successfully amplified the target L1 HPV52 gene in 100 bp but not in L1 HPV16 gene. So in this research primer and positive control to detect HPV52 has been developed, but it needs optimization for detection of HPV16.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Immanuelle Kezia [10616014]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Azzania Fibriani, S.Si., M.Si., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Biologi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Ilmu dan Teknologi Hayati", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "HPV16, HPV52, primer, L1 protein", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Jun 2020"}
