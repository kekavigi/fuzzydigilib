A new non-Euclidean model was established, in which the effects of penny-\nshaped cracks and axial in-situ stress on zonal disintegration of deep rock masses were taken into\naccount. Based on the non-Euclidean model, the stress intensity factors at tips of the penny-\nshaped cracks were determined. The strain energy density factor was applied to investigate the\noccurrence of fractured zones. It was observed from the numerical results that the magnitude and\nlocation of fractured zones were sensitive to micro- and macro-mechanical parameters, as well as\nthe value of in-situ stress. The numerical results were in good agreement with the experimental\ndata.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xiaoping Zhou [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Qihu Qian, Hanfei Song"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "deep rock masses containing penny-shaped cracks, the non-Euclidean model, axial in-situ stress, fractured zones, zonal disintegration phenomenon, deep circular tunnel I.
