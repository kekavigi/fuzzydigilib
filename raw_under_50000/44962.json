{"Nomor": 44962, "Judul": "Beam dynamics issues for the two-frequency crab cavity short pulse scheme", "Abstrak": "We report the study of various beam dynamics issues arising from the scheme of using two-frequency\ncrab cavities to generate short pulse x-rays for timed-resolved experiments in a storage ring while\nsimultaneously supplying high brightness beams to other users. These issues include the prediction of the\nshort pulse performance, the choice of system parameters, the impact of the crab cavities on injection\nefficiency and beam lifetime of the camshaft bunch, and the impact of crab cavities on the regular beam.\nThe collective effect requirements and the separation of short pulses and regular beams are also discussed. With this scheme applied to the SPEAR3 ring, the short pulse flux would be equivalent to a 0.5 nC bunch with a duration of 3 ps (full width half maximum, fwhm), or a 2 nC bunch with a duration of 7 ps (fwhm).", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xiaobiao Huang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Bob Hettel, Tom Rabedeau, James Safranek, Jim Sebek, Kai Tian, and Kent P.
