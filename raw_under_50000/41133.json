Vibration governing equations of an N-layer carbon\nnanotube are formulated by considering the scale effect. In the numerical simulations, the effects of\ndifferent theories, small-scale, variation of wavenumber, the innermost radius and length of doublewalled\nand triple-walled carbon nanotubes are considered. Vibrational frequencies decrease with\nan increase of scale coefficient, the innermost radius, length of nanotube and effects of wall number\nare negligible. The results show that the cut-off frequencies can be influenced by the wall number\nof nanotubes.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Qingtian Deng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zhichun Yang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "vibration, multi-walled carbon nanotubes, fluid-filled, nonlocal elastic theory", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 27, No. 6, December, 2014", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Jul 2019"}
