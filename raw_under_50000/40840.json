{"Nomor": 40840, "Judul": "MODELING CONTACTSOF IONIC POLYMERMETAL COMPOSITESBASED TACTILE SENSORS", "Abstrak": "We report the first attempt to model the contacts of an ionic polymer metal com-\nposite (IPMC) based tactile sensor. The tactile sensor comprises an IPMC actuator, an IPMC\nsensor and the target to be detected. The system makes use of multiple contacts to work: the\nactuator comes into contact with the sensor and pushes the movement of sensor; the contact be-\ntween the sensor and the object detects the existence and the stiffness of the target. We integrate\nmodeling of various physical processes involved in IPMC devices to form a simulation scheme. An\niteration and optimization strategy is also described to correlate the experimental and simulation\nresults of an IPMC bending actuator to identify the two key parameters used in electromechanical\ntransduction. Modeling the multiple contacts will aid the design and optimization of such IPMC\nbased soft robotics.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xiangting Jia [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Meie Li, Jinxiong Zhou"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "tactile sensor, contact, finite element method", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 27, No. 4, August, 2014", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "16 Jul 2019"}
