{"Nomor": 45043, "Judul": "Tuning crystallographic compatibility to enhance shape memory in ceramics", "Abstrak": "The extraordinary ability of shape-memory alloys to recover after large imposed deformation motivates\nefforts to transpose these properties onto ceramics, which would enable practical shape-memory properties at high temperatures and in harsh environments. The theory of mechanical compatibility was utilized to predict promising ceramic candidates in the system (Y0.5Ta0.5O2 )1?x-(Zr0.5Hf0.5O2 )x, 0.6 < x < 0.85. When these compatibility conditions are met, a reduction in thermal hysteresis by a factor of 2.5, a tripling of deformability, and a 75% enhancement in strain recovery within the shape-memory effect was found. These findings reveal that predicting and optimizing the chemical composition of ceramics to attain improved crystallographic compatibility is a powerful tool for enabling and enhancing their deformability that could ultimately lead to a highly reversible oxide ceramic shape-memory material.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Justin Jetter [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hanlin Gu, Haolu Zhang, Manfred Wuttig, Xian Chen, Julia R.
