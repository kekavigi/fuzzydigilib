{"Nomor": 45003, "Judul": "Sand Transport In Multiphase Flow Mixtures In A Horizontal Pipeline: An Experimental Investigation", "Abstrak": "An inherent problem with both oil and natural gas production is the deposition of sand particles in\npipeline, which could lead to problems such as excessive pressure drops, equipment failure, pipeline\nerosion, and production decline. The characterization of sand particles transport and sedimentation in\ndifferent flow systems such as sandemultiphase mixtures is vital to predict the sand transport velocity\nand entrainment processes in oil and gas transportation pipelines. However, it seems that no model\nexists able to accurately characterize the sand transport and deposition in multiphase pipeline. In fact, in\nthe last decade several researchers tried to extend the modeling of liquid-solid flow to gas-liquid-solid\nflow, but no significant results have been obtained, especially in slug flow condition due to the\ncomplexity of the phenomenon. In order to develop and validate a mathematical model properly\nformulated for the calculation of the sand critical deposition velocity in gas-liquid flow, more and more\nexperimental data are necessary. This paper presents a preliminary experimental study of three phase\nflows (air-water-sand) inside a horizontal pipe and the application of the sand-liquid models present in\nliterature. Significant observations were made during the experimental study from which several conclusions were drawn. Different sand flow regimes were established by physical observation and data\nanalysis: fully dispersed solid flow, moving dunes and stationary bed. The critical deposition velocities\nwere determined at different sand concentrations. It was concluded that sand transport characteristics\nand the critical deposition velocity are strongly dependent on the gas-liquid flow regime and on sand\nconcentration", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MARIELLA LEPORINI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Barbara Marchetti", "Francesco Corvaro", "Giuseppe di Giovine", "Fabio Polonara", "Alessandro Terenzi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Sand transport, Multiphase flow, Minimum transport condition, Deposition, Experimental investigation, Oil and gas", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 5, Issue 2, Pages 161-170 (June  2019), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.04.004", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Nov 2019"}
