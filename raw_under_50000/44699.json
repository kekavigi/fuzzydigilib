{"Nomor": 44699, "Judul": "An Effective Technology for the Development of Immediate Release Solid Dosage Forms Containing Low-Dose Drug: Fused Deposition Modeling 3D Printing", "Abstrak": "Purpose Fabrication of immediate release (IR) tablet formulations with rapid release profile via fused deposition modeling\n3D printing (FDM 3DP) is a challenge. The aims of this study\nwere to prepare IR tablets with different dissolution profiles\nand to increase their in vitro dissolution rates by making physical modifications on them. Pramipexole was used as the model low-dose drug.\nMethods Polymeric filaments were prepared with six different combinations of Eudragit EPO and poly(ethylene) oxide\nby hot melt extrusion and 3D tablets were produced using an\nFDM printer. Characterization studies for the filaments and\ntablets were carried out. The printability of the filaments was\nalso evaluated using a novel mechanical characterization\nmethod. Tablet formulation with optimum dissolution profile\nwas chosen and physical modifications (infill %, shape change\nand thickness) on this formulation were made.\nResults Low-dose pramipexole loading filaments and 3D tablets were homogenously prepared. The printability of the filaments was related to their flexibility. With the physical modifications, the drug release completion time of the tablets reduced to 5 min.\nConclusions The same rapid release profiles with conventional IR tablets can be reached by making only physical changes\non 3D tablets without using any filling or disintegrating\nagents.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hazal Ezgi G\u00fcltekin [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Serdar Tort  &  F\u00fcsun Acart\u00fcrk"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Pharmacology & therapeutics", "Kata Kunci": "3D printing . fused deposition modeling . hot melt extrusion . immediate release . personalized medicine", "Sumber": "Pharm Res (2019) 36: 128", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Nov 2019"}
