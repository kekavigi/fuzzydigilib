{"Nomor": 46078, "Judul": "ELECTROCHEMICAL OXIDATION OF ORGANIC MOLECULES AT LOWER OVERPOTENTIAL: ACCESSING BROADER FUNCTIONAL GROUP COMPATIBILITY WITH ELECTRON?PROTON TRANSFER MEDIATORS", "Abstrak": "Electrochemical organic oxidation reactions are\nhighly appealing because protons are often effective terminal\nelectron acceptors, thereby avoiding undesirable stoichiometric\noxidants. These reactions are often plagued by high overpotentials,\nhowever, that greatly limit their utility. Single-electron transfer\n(SET) from organic molecules generates high-energy radicalcations.\nFormation of such intermediates often requires electrode\npotentials far above the thermodynamic potentials of the reaction\nand frequently causes decomposition and/or side reactions of\nancillary functional groups. In this Account, we show how\nelectrocatalytic electron?proton transfer mediators (EPTMs)\naddress this challenge. EPTMs bypass the formation of radicalcation\nintermediates by supporting mechanisms that operate at electrode potentials much lower (?1 V) than those of analogous\ndirect electrolysis reactions.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Fei Wang  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Shannon S.
