The physical model and theoretical solution are presented to\npredict the corresponding waveforms for aluminum samples under the ablation generation regime.\nThe waveforms of the excited Rayleigh and Lamb waves by laser with selected pulse duration\nwere measured by laser interferometer and analyzed theoretically, and the agreement between\nmeasurement and analysis is demonstrated for the validation of the theoretical model and solution.\nThe broadening of the Rayleigh wave and the disappearing of high order Lamb wave modes can\nbe found with the increase of the pulse duration by the laser ultrasonic technique.", "Daftar File": {"2015 EJRNL PP Zhen Zhang 1.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/178243"}, "Penulis": "Zhen Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yong dong Pan,   Yi Xiao, Zheng Zhong"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Rayleigh wave, Lamb wave, pulse duration, laser ultrasonic technique", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 5, October, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Jul 2019"}
