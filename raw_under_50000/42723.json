{"Nomor": 42723, "Judul": "Backward face ageing model (B-FAM) for digital face image rejuvenation", "Abstrak": "Facial ageing modelling has been an active research topic in the field of anthropology. Considering the fact that ageing is a non-uniform and a non-linear process for different face types (e.g. origins, gender etc.), dealing with a reliable faceageing model may considerably help investigators working in some specific fields such as forensics. Unlike numerous studies dealing with forward or predictive face models, in this study, the authors propose a backward model aiming at estimating childhood face images using their corresponding adult face appearance as an input. For the proposed approach, face contour and different components are modified non-linearly, based on an estimated geometrical model. On the other hand, the face texture is estimated by mapping a reference face texture to the estimated geometrical model. This approach will show that it will be possible to \u2018digitally\u2019 rejuvenate an adult person's face down to it being 3\u20134 years old. For evaluation purposes, a database has been created from 112 subjects. Results have been evaluated using both objective (face recognition system) and subjective (human perception) criteria. The most promising and interesting results will be highlighted further ahead.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Elham Farazdaghi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Amine Nait-Ali"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "IET Biometrics", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Sep 2019"}
