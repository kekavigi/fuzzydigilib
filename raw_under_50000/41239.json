{"Nomor": 41239, "Judul": "Geochemical Characteristics of Sunda Volcanic Arc in Sumatra and Andaman", "Abstrak": "Geochemical characteristics of Sunda volcanic belt are recognized from each characteristic of Weh Island,\nTabuan Island in Semangko Bay, South Sumatra, and Andaman Islands. Trace and rare earth elements (REE) are\nproduced by fumaroles in a marine environment of submarine volcano of Weh Island characterized by barium (Ba)\nas an indicator of sea water influence in the mineralization process, while sulphide minerals do not occur in this area.\nREE pattern compared to Mid Oceanic Ridge Basalt (MORB) shows a characteristic of subduction tectonics and is\ndistributed in shallow coastal water of high energy. Based on comparison of REE contents in all samples, it reveals\nthat volcanism process causes REE enrichments either in the past or in recent. Geochemical characteristics of Tabuan\nIsland in Semangko Bay reveal the occurrence of hydrothermal mineralization followed by pervasive occurrences\nof sulphide minerals in vein-type disseminations enriched in Au, Ag, Zn, Pb, Cu, As, Sb, Ba, and Mn. Geochemical\ncharacteristics of Andaman Islands reveal imprint of substantial subduction component in the form of sediment fluid\nand melt and fluid-induced subduction component derived from altered oceanic crust.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hananto Kurnio [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Earth sciences", "Kata Kunci": "geochemical characteristics, Sunda volcanic belt, Weh Island, Semangko Bay, Andaman Islands", "Sumber": "Indonesian Journal on Geoscience Vol. 6 No. 1 April 2019: 1-16", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Agu 2019"}
