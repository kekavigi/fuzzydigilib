{"Nomor": 45257, "Judul": "Evaluation Of Efecting Factors On Oil Recovery Using The Desirability Function", "Abstrak": "The new method to evaluate the contribution of the related factors to the oil recovery is proposed by using the desirability\nmodel. The related factors are re-scaled and combined to be a single parameter in order to correlate with an indicator of oil\nrecovery. The correlated result could be able to predict a trend of the factors and oil recovery as an empirical approach if a\ngood correlation is achieved. Three published works of the corefooding experiments are examined the efectivenesses and\nlimitations of the proposed model. The analysed plots of desirability and the oil recovery imply an insight into the oil recovery mechanisms by indicating the dominant factors. The results meet a good agreement with the published works. Although\nthe dominant factors are indicated and the correlation trend is able to be determined, the accuracy of the proposed method\nneeds a high number of data sets to increase the statistical reliability", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SUPARIT TANGPARITKUL [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Evaluation Of Efecting Factors On Oil Recovery Using The Desirability Function"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Reservoir engineering, Oil production, Enhanced oil recovery, Desirability function, Rock and fuid properties", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Exploration and Production Technology, Volume 8, Issue 4, 1199-1208 (December 2018), https://doi.org/10.1007/s13202-018-0438-3", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Des 2019"}
