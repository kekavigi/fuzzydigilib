A total of 90 soil samples were collected from 30 different soil profiles\nof dry fields throughout Chongqing, China randomly to show how soil could be a crucial part of water\nresources by discussing their five types of calculated soil water reservoir capacities, namely the total soil\nwater reservoir capacity (mm) (TC), soil water storage capacity (mm) (SC), unavailable soil water reservoir\ncapacity (mm) (UC), available soil water reservoir capacity (mm) (AC), and soil dead water storage\ncapacity (mm) (DC) in certain layer, respectively. Overall, the total soil water reservoir capacity in\n0\u201340 cm was about 209 mm, of which 70 mm belonged to available soil water reservoir capacity. Not\nall the five types of soil water reservoir capacities had significant correlations between each other. Soil\nstructure, especially the size and quantity of soil pore was mainly determined by soil particle composition\n(clay, silt, and sand content). The more sand and less clay led to the more soil macropores, which\nprovided room for soil water. Thus, clay, silt, and sand content jointly produced profound influence on\nsoil water reservoir capacities. Nevertheless, specific water capacity and topographic factors displayed\nweak correlations to soil water reservoir capacities, which required further research works. Ultimately,\nthe better regression models were achieved by multiple regression analysis coupled with \u2018\u2018merged groups\nPCA\u2019\u2019 than by multiple regression analysis with \u2018\u2018all variables PCA\u2019\u2019. UC, SC, TC and DC could be well\nsimulated (mostly R2 > 0.70; P < 0.05) through normal multiple regression analysis using original variables\nas well as multiple regression analysis with \u2018\u2018merged groups PCA\u2019\u2019. Only regression models of TC\nand DC were highly significant (mostly R2 > 0.70; P < 0.05) through \u2018\u2018all variables PCA\u2019\u2019 method. And there\nwere poor coefficients of determination (R2) for AC (mostly R2 < 0.40; P < 0.05) by all the three regression\nmethods.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Liu Juan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wei Chao-Fu, Xie Qian, Zhang Wei-Hua"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Clay content, Multiple regression analysis, Principal component analysis, Soil physical characteristics, Soil water reservoir capacities", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Jul 2019"}
