{"Nomor": 48948, "Judul": "ON A SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE APPROACH TO SURROGATE MODELLING: PREDICTING THE AEROELASTIC FLUTTER BOUNDARY WITHIN THE TRANSONIC MACH REGIME", "Abstrak": "Where non linear aerodynamics sets a precedent in the governing flow, to which the\ntransonic Mach regime is concerned, producing aeroelastic models under such conditions\nhave taken its toll on the balance between computational cost and accuracy. This\nthesis investigates the utilization of the Support Vector Machine algorithm to produce\na surrogate model/response surface based on estimations of the damping coefficients of\naeroelastic models in order to predict the flutter boundary for a binary flutter system\nbased on a NACA 64A010 airfoil. A single fidelity aeroelastic model, in which the\naerodynamics is governed by the Euler equations and the aeroelastic equations of motion\nsolved in the time domain, is studied across a parameter space. Whereby, the proposed\nspace is bounded and varied in the Mach range of 0.7-0.9 and the Flutter Speed Index\nof a range 0.4-2.0, wherein, the transonic dip is successfully demonstrated. The Prony\nseries based Matrix Pencil, as a system identification method, is used to estimate the\ndamping coefficients, in which the inputs are the Pitch and Plunge responses of the\naeroelastic system. With the damping estimates, a single Support Vector Classification\nalong with two Support Vector Regression models, Epsilon-SVR and Least Squares-SVR\n(LS-SVR), were used to generate the response surfaces. With the regression models\nindicating promising results, two new sampling plans based on an Augemented Latin\nHypercube of 75 samples was proposed with the aim to further reduce the computational\ncost. Results indicate that the Epsilon-SVR model with its satisfactory generalization\ncapabilities produced the best predicitions for the flutter boundary, however, the results\nalso suggests the difficulty posed when dealing with training and test distributions in\nthe samples.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Muhammad Faiz Izzaturrahman": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/209064"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Faiz Izzaturrahman [13616109]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Lavi Rizki Zuhal"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Aeroelasticity, Flutter Boundary, Matrix Pencil, Support Vector Machines", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Agu 2020"}
