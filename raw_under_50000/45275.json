{"Nomor": 45275, "Judul": "Stability Of Interbed For Salt Cavern Gas Storage In Solution Mining Considering Cusp Displacement Catastrophe Theory", "Abstrak": "Cusp displacement catastrophe theory can be introduced to propose a new method about instability\nfailure of the interbed for gas storage cavern in bedded salt in solution mining. We can\ncalculate initial fracture drawing pace of this interbed to obtain 2D and 3D gas storage shapes at\nthis time. Moreover, Stability evaluation of strength reduction finite element method (FEM) based\non this catastrophe theory can used to evaluate this interbed stability after initial fracture. A specific\nexample is simulated to obtain the influence of the interbed depth, cavern internal pressure, and\ncavern building time on stability safety factor (SSF). The results indicate: the value of SSF will be\nlower with the increase of cavern building time in solution mining and the increase of interbed\ndepth and also this value remains a rise with the increase of cavern internal pressure Especially, we\ncan conclude that the second-fracture of the interbed may take place when this pressure is lower\nthan 6 MPa or after 6 days later of the interbed after initial fracture. According to above analysis,\nsome effective measures, namely elevating the tube up to the top of the interbed, or changing the\ncirculation of in-and-out lines, can be introduced to avoid the negative effects when the secondfracture\nof the interbed may occur.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "LE YU [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jianjun Liu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Cusp displacement catastrophe theory, The interbed, Gas storage cavern, Initial fracture drawing pace, Stability evalua", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 1, Pages 82-90 (March  2015),      http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.03.006", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Des 2019"}
