{"Nomor": 43054, "Judul": "A Control Scheme for Islanded and Grid-Connected DC Microgrids", "Abstrak": "DC microgrids can be operated either in the islanded\nmode or the grid-connected mode. The droop technique is\nwidely used to control dc microgrids in both modes. The voltage\ndeviation and the current sharing error are the main problems\nassociated with the droop technique. This paper presents a\ncontrol system for both islanded and grid-connected dc\nmicrogrids. The droop method is used to control each converter\nin dc microgrid to share the required power depending on its\nrating. The secondary loop is used to solve the problems\nassociated with the voltage deviation in islanded mode, while in\ngrid-connected mode, the tertiary controller is used to control\nthe supplied power from dc microgrid to the main grid. The\ncurrent sharing loop is used to improve the accuracy of power\nsharing between all converters in both modes, where the droop\nresistance of each converter in dc microgrid is updated\ncontinuously based on the current sharing error. The dynamic\nperformance of the proposed control system for dc microgrid is\nnumerically evaluated under different modes of operations.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mohamed Mokhtar [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mostafa I.
