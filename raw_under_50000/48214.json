{"Nomor": 48214, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT CATALYTIC CRACKING OF PALM OIL TO PRODUCE BIOGASOLINE", "Abstrak": "The import of fuels in Indonesia is still fairly high to meet the large demand that cannot\nbe met by national production. The raw material for fuels such as gasoline still generally\ncomes from crude oil. Concerns on the depletion of crude oil reserves have encouraged\nthe use of alternative renewable sources. As Indonesia is one of the largest producers and\nexporters of palm oil in the world, palm oil could be a potential source to produce\nbiogasoline through catalytic cracking using HZSM-5 and HY catalyst. It is crucial to\ndevelop a catalyst that meets the standard of EURO 4, which is a gasoline having\nmaximum aromatic content of 35%-v, maximum benzene content of 1%-v and RON\nminimum of 91. Combining HZSM-5 and HY catalyst is expected to result in high\nconversion of palm oil into biogasoline with low aromatic content because HZSM-5\ncatalyst favors high conversion but it has high selectivity towards aromatics, whereas HY\nis the opposite.\nThe objective of this research is to develop a catalyst for the catalytic cracking of palm\noil to produce biogasoline that meets the standard of EURO 4. Catalyst synthesis is done\nby varying the composition of parent HZSM-5 and HY catalysts and composition of\nhierarchical HZSM-5 and HY catalysts. Hierarchical modification of HZSM-5 by\ndesilication and dealumination is required to overcome diffusion limitations caused by\nhaving small pore size. The catalyst activity test is carried out for 3 hours at 1 atm, 500\u00b0C,\nWHSV of 2.5 hours-1 and 2.5 g catalyst per run. The catalyst characterization methods\nconducted are N2 isothermal adsorption, XRD, and NH3-TPD, while analysis of the liquid\nproduct obtained is done using GC-DHA.\nThe conclusion that can be drawn from this research is that HZSM-5 catalyst has a higher\nselectivity towards aromatics, whereas HY catalyst is more selective towards paraffin and\nolefin. The addition of HZSM-5 catalyst to HY catalyst causes an increase in reaction\nconversion, aromatic selectivity and RON, and a decrease in coke formation. The best\ncatalyst variation that is the closest to meeting the standard Euro 4 is 5%HZSM-5-\nHier/HY, which produces gasoline with RON 97 and aromatic content 26%-v. However,\nthe benzene content is still 1.76%-v.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Alicia Nadila Pramesti": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/207920", "COVER Alicia Nadila Pramesti": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/218214", "BAB 5 Alicia Nadila Pramesti": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/218219", "PUSTAKA Alicia Nadila Pramesti": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/218220"}, "Penulis": "Alicia Nadila Pramesti [13016217]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
