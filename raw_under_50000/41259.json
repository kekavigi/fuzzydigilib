The results\nfrom the method developed are compared using the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method. It\nis concluded that the method developed requires fewer collocations than MCS method to obtain\nvery high accuracy and greatly reduces the computational cost. Based on the method, the elasto-\nplastic and elasto-brittle-plastic analyses of rocks under mechanical loadings are conducted to\nstudy the uncertainty in heterogeneous rock failure behaviour.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Pengzhi Pan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Fangsheng Su, Haijun Chen"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "uncertainty analysis, probabilistic collocation method, elasto-plastic cellular au- tomaton, Karhunen-Loeve expansion, rock failure process, PCM-EPCA", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 5, October, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Agu 2019"}
