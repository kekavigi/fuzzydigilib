{"Nomor": 44712, "Judul": "Seismic waves in 3-D: from mantle asymmetries to reliable seismic hazard assessment", "Abstrak": "A global cross-section of the Earth parallel to\nthe tectonic equator (TE) path, the great circle representing\nthe equator of net lithosphere rotation, shows a difference\nin shear wave velocities between the western and eastern\nflanks of the three major oceanic rift basins. The lowvelocity layer in the upper asthenosphere, at a depth range\nof 120 to 200 km, is assumed to represent the decoupling\nbetween the lithosphere and the underlying mantle. Along\nthe TE-perturbed (TE-pert) path, a ubiquitous LVZ, about\n1,000-km-wide and 100-km-thick, occurs in the asthenosphere. The existence of the TE-pert is a necessary prerequisite for the existence of a continuous global flow\nwithin the Earth. Ground-shaking scenarios were constructed using a scenario-based method for seismic hazard\nanalysis (NDSHA), using realistic and duly validated\nsynthetic time series, and generating a data bank of several\nthousands of seismograms that account for source, propagation, and site effects. Accordingly, with basic selforganized criticality concepts, NDSHA permits the integration of available information provided by the most\nupdated seismological, geological, geophysical, and\ngeotechnical databases for the site of interest, as well as\nadvanced physical modeling techniques, to provide a reliable and robust background for the development of a\ndesign basis for cultural heritage and civil infrastructures.\nEstimates of seismic hazard obtained using the NDSHA\nand standard probabilistic approaches are compared for the\nItalian territory, and a case-study is discussed. In order to\nenable a reliable estimation of the ground motion response\nto an earthquake, three-dimensional velocity models have\nto be considered, resulting in a new, very efficient, analytical procedure for computing the broadband seismic\nwave-field in a 3-D anelastic Earth model.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Giuliano F.
