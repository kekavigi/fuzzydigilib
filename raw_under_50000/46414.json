{"Nomor": 46414, "Judul": "CONTROLLING PHOTON BUNCHING AND ANTIBUNCHING OF TWO QUANTUM EMITTERS NEAR A CORE-SHELL SPHERE", "Abstrak": "The collective spontaneous emission of two point-dipole emitters near a plasmonic core-shell nanosphere is theoretically investigated. Based on the expansion of mode functions in vector spherical harmonics, we derive closed analytical expressions for both the cooperative decay rate and the dipole-dipole interaction strength associated with two point dipoles close to a sphere. Considering a plasmonic nanoshell containing a linearly amplifying medium inside the core, the second-order correlation function for the two emitters shows that it is possible to tune the photon emission, selecting either photon bunching or antibunching as a function of the polarization and position of the sphere. This result opens vistas to applications involving tunable single-photon sources in engineered artificial media.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Tiago J.
