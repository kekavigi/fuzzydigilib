{"Nomor": 46115, "Judul": "MOTHER KNOWS BEST: DECIPHERING THE ANTIBACTERIAL PROPERTIES OF HUMAN MILK OLIGOSACCHARIDES", "Abstrak": "This Account describes the risky proposition\nof organizing a multidisciplinary team to interrogate a\nchallenging problem in chemical biology: characterizing how\nhuman milk, at the molecular level, protects infants from\ninfectious diseases. At the outset, our initial hypothesis was\nthat human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) possess antimicrobial\nand antivirulence activities. Early on, we discovered that\nHMOs do indeed modulate bacterial growth and biofilm\nproduction for numerous bacterial pathogens. In light of this\ndiscovery, three priorities emerged for our program moving\nforward. The first was to decode the mode of action behind\nthis activity. The second was to decipher the functional effects\nof HMO structural diversity as there are ca. 200 unique HMOs .....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Kelly M.
