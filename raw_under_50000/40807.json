{"Nomor": 40807, "Judul": "EFFECT OF LOADING TYPE ONFATIGUE CRACK GROWTHBEHAVIOR OF SOLDER JOINT IN ELECTRONIC PACKAGING", "Abstrak": "Fatigue cracking tests of a solder joint were carried out using in-situ scanning elec-\ntron microscopy (SEM) technology under tensile and bending cyclic loadings. The method for\npredicting the fatigue life is provided based on the fatigue crack growth rate of the solder joint.\nThe results show that the effect of the loading type on the fatigue crack growth behavior of a\nsolder joint cannot be ignored. In addition, the finite element analysis results help quantitatively\nestimate the response relationship between solder joint structures. The fatigue crack initiation\nlife of a solder joint is in good agreement with the fatigue life (N50%) of a totally electronic board\nwith 36 solder joints.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xishu Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Huaihui Ren, Bisheng Wu, Su Ja,  Norio Kawagoishi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "microcracking, fatigue, MEMS, experimental techniques, finite element method I.
