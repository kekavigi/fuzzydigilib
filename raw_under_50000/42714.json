{"Nomor": 42714, "Judul": "Robust footstep identification system based on acoustic local features", "Abstrak": "Footsteps, as a main kind of behavioural trait are a universally available signal. However, it remains a challenging\nproblem to construct a robust footstep authentication system. Since, in practise, footsteps are usually accompanied with noisy and environmental sounds, it is difficult to extract stable footstep features from the mixed sounds. This study describes a novel robust footstep identification system. To extract stable features from the footsteps mixed with noisy or environmental sounds, a robust acoustic local feature extraction method is proposed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Fangxia Guo [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xuan Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "IET Biometrics", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Sep 2019"}
