{"Nomor": 41135, "Judul": "UNIFIEDMODELING OF THE MONOTONICAND CYCLIC BEHAVIORS OF SAND AND CLAY", "Abstrak": "In this study, we aim to investigate a unified modeling method for the monotonic\nand cyclic behaviors of sand and clay. A simple double-yield-surface model, with plastic hardening\nmodulus and dilatancy relation being dependent on density state unlike in existing approaches,\nis developed by considering the location of the critical state line. The model is used to simulate\nthe drained and undrained tests of various sands and clays under monotonic and cyclic loadings.\nPrediction results are compared with experimental results, which show that the proposed approach\nis capable of modeling the monotonic and cyclic behaviors of sand and clay.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yinfu Jin [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zhenyu Yin,  Hongwei Huang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "sand, clay, constitutive relations, plasticity, critical state, cyclic loading", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 2, April, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Jul 2019"}
