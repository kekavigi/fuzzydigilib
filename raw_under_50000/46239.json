{"Nomor": 46239, "Judul": "PROMOTION OF ENDOTHELIAL CELL ADHESION AND ANTITHROMBOGENICITY OF POLYTETRAFLUOROETHYLENE BY CHEMICAL GRAFTING OF CHONDROITIN SULFATE", "Abstrak": "Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is one of the polymers\nextensively applied in biomedicine. However, the application of PTFE\nas a small-diameter vascular graft results in thrombosis and intimal\nhyperplasia because of the immune response. Therefore, improving\nthe biocompatibility and anticoagulant properties of PTFE is a key to\nsolving this problem. In this study, a hydroxyl group-rich surface was\nobtained by oxidizing a benzoin-reduced PTFE membrane. Then,\nchondroitin sulfate (CS), an anticoagulant, was grafted on the surface\nof the hydroxylated PTFE membrane using 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane.\nThe successful modification of the membrane in each step was\ndemonstrated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray\nphotoelectron spectroscopy. Hydroxylation and the grafting of CS\ngreatly increased the hydrophilicity and roughness of membrane\nsamples. Moreover, the hydroxylated PTFE membrane enhanced the adhesion ability of endothelial cells, and the grafting of CS also promoted the proliferation of endothelial cells and decreased platelet adhesion. The results indicate that the PTFE membranes grafted with CS are able to facilitate rapid endothelialization and inhibit thrombus formation, which makes the proposed method outstanding for artificial blood vessel applications.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lei Ma [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xuyan Li,?
