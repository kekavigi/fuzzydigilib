{"Nomor": 44948, "Judul": "PROTOTYPING OF STRUCTURE OF DRILLING MACHINE", "Abstrak": "In this research it is implied to prototype the structure of drilling machine only, which the main components of this machine consists of four parts that to be made, such as worktable, base column, column and the head part. The methodology in the case study is firstly discussed about the CAD drawing required to fix the machining process and then preparing the CAD drawing for real casting involved machine allowances added, analysis to provide the casting design equipment systems for entire components to support in real mold making, the techniques to consult the casting condition and its elements function, in case we trial with the casting software to predict the defects occur on the cast part and modification to provide the good casting design systems. The software that used in this simulation is Z-CastPro software, this software is one of the computer application that can use to simulate and analysis all of flow and solid conditions based on its shape mold.\nThe concept to growth the real prototype of the components is followed with all the casting procedures, such as made the real pattern, core printed based on the geometric dimensioning of the worktable, base column, column, and head component respectively; and involved real mold making for each shape to be produced and cast the product based on its mold. The final step is post process the product, this technique is used the machining process to clean the rough surface and modified the un-finished features from the casting process until it completed as the statements.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Huy Visal": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/188758", "BAB 1 Huy Visal": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/188759", "BAB 2 Huy Visal": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/188760", "BAB 3A Huy Visal": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/188761", "BAB 3B Huy Visal": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/188762", "BAB 3C Huy Visal": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/188763", "BAB 4 Huy Visal": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/188764", "BAB 5 Huy Visal": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/188765", "PUSTAKA Huy Visal": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/188766"}, "Penulis": "Huy Visal [23116708]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
