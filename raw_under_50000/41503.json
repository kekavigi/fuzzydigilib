Using the co-seismic displacement field and AK135 spherical layered Earth model, we invert co-seismic slip distribution along the seismic fault. We also search the best fault geometry model to fit the observed data. Assuming that the dip angle linearly increases in downward direction, the postfit residual variation of the inversed geometry model with dip angles linearly changing along fault strike are plotted. The geometry model with local minimum misfits is the one with dip angle linearly increasing along strike from 4.3o in top southernmost patch to 4.5o in top northernmost path and dip angle linearly increased. By using the fault shape and geodetic co-seismic data, we estimate the slip distribution on the curved fault. Our result shows that the earthquake ruptured ~200-km width down to a depth of about 60 km. 0.5\u201312.5 m of thrust slip is resolved with the largest slip centered around the central section of the rupture zone 7\u00baN\u201310\u00baN in latitude. The estimated seismic moment is 8.2 \u00d7 1022 N m, which is larger than estimation from the centroid moment magnitude (4.0 \u00d7 1022 N m), and smaller than estimation from normal-mode oscillation data modeling (1.0 \u00d7 1023 N m).", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yongge Wan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zheng-kang Shen, Min Wang, Yuehua Zeng, Jichao Huang, Xiang Li, Huawei Cui, Xiwei Gao"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Earth sciences", "Kata Kunci": "Sumatra\u2013Andaman earthquake,  Fault geometry,  Co-seismic slip distribution,  Geodetic data", "Sumber": "Earthquake Science  June 2015, Volume 28, Issue 3, pp 187\u2013195", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Agu 2019"}
