The possible criteria for the solution of this road way are length,\nsurface, traffic, and width of the road. Types of vehicle across the road also give a contribution\nto the criteria. By using Geography Information System (GIS), it is easy to all drivers to take\ndecision which way has to be chosen based on the real condition. GIS is used to visualize the\nalternative road, which is possible to take. Analytic Hierarchy Processing (AHP) is a decision\nmethod which is based on many criteria and alternatives. The input of AHP can be a preference\nor real value. Applied AHP to decide value of each alternative is based on application of\nWireless Application Protocol (WAP) assessment.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Arna Fariza [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Afrida Helen, Ardinur Mahyuzar"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "AHP, jalur alternatif, sistem informasi geografis, WAP", "Sumber": "TELKOMNIKA; Yogyakarta Vol. 7, Iss. 2,  (Aug 2009): 137-144.", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Okt 2019"}
