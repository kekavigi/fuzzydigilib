{"Nomor": 46181, "Judul": "INJECTABLE HIGHLY TUNABLE OLIGOMERIC COLLAGEN MATRICES FOR DENTAL TISSUE REGENERATION", "Abstrak": "Current stem cell transplantation approaches lack efficacy, because they limit cell survival and retention and, more\nimportantly, lack a suitable cellular niche to modulate lineage-specific differentiation. Here, we evaluate the intrinsic ability of type I\noligomeric collagen matrices to modulate dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) endothelial and odontogenic differentiation as a potential\nstem cell-based therapy for regenerative endodontics. DPSCs were encapsulated in low-stiffness (235 Pa) and high-stiffness (800 Pa)\noligomeric collagen matrices and then evaluated for long-term cell survival, as well as endothelial and odontogenic differentiation\nfollowing in vitro cell culture. Moreover, the effect of growth factor incorporation, i.e., vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)\ninto 235 Pa oligomeric collagen or bone morphogenetic protein (BMP2) into the 800 Pa oligomeric collagen counterpart on\nendothelial or odontogenic differentiation of encapsulated DPSCs was investigated. DPSCs-laden oligomeric collagen matrices allowed long-term cell survival. Real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) data showed that the DPSCs cultured in 235 Pa matrices demonstrated an increased expression of endothelial markers after 28 days, and the effect was enhanced upon VEGF incorporation. There was a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity at Day 14 in the 800 Pa DPSCs-laden oligomeric collagen matrices, regardless of BMP2 incorporation. However, Alizarin S data demonstrated higher mineralization by Day 21 and the effect was amplified in BMP2-modified matrices. Herein, we present key data that strongly support future research aimed at clinical translation of an injectable oligomeric collagen system for delivery and fate regulation of DPSCs to enable pulp and dentin regeneration at specific locations of the root canal system.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Divya Pankajakshan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sherry L.
