{"Nomor": 40107, "Judul": "ANALISIS DEFORMASI GEMPA LOMBOK 2018 BERDASARKAN DATA PENGAMATAN GPS KONTINU METODE KINEMATIK", "Abstrak": "Lombok Island is an area that has an earthquake potential because it is located between two earthquake sources, namely Bali-Lombok subduction zones and Flores Back Arc Thrusting in the north. In 2018, there were at least four earthquakes on Lombok Island with a magnitude above 6. There are changes in shape and changes in dimensions, or so-called deformations, on Lombok Island as a result of earthquakes. Based on these reasons, understanding and monitoring of Lombok earthquake deformation is needed, especially during an earthquake. Therefore, kinematic analysis of Lombok earthquake deformation is needed. Kinematic analysis is done by making continuous observations on several GPS observation stations located on Lombok Island. GPS observation data obtained were then processed by using Bernese 5.2 scientific software to find out its coordinate in every epoch. Based on the results of data processing, the largest horizontal displacement value in the August 5 earthquake was at the KDOO observation point of 5.354 cm and the smallest at the PGRJ observation point of 1.830 cm, while the largest vertical displacement value at the PGRJ observation point was 13.974 cm and the smallest at the KDOO observation point 2.991 cm. In the August 19 earthquake, the largest horizontal displacement value was at the KDOO observation point of 13.610 cm and the smallest at the CMAT observation point of 2.878 cm, while the largest vertical displacement value at the CMAT observation point was 15,298 cm and the smallest at KDOO observation point was 4,137 cm.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Nauval Ghifari [15115024]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Irwan Meilano, S.T., M.Sc.", "Dr. Ir.
