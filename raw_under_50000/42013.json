{"Nomor": 42013, "Judul": "BUSINESS PROCESS IMPROVEMENT OF FIXED WING UAV ASSEMBLY PROCESS: IMPERIA DIRGANTARA CASE", "Abstrak": "Imperia Dirgantara is a company engaged in providing aerial survey\nsolutions using their own university-based research Unmanned Aerial Vehicle\n(UAV) technology and data processing systems. To anticipate an increasing\ndemand of the aerial survey, the UAV has to be prepared in a short preparation\ntime. Currently, Imperia Dirgantara is facing an issue of lengthy assembly process\nof the UAV which may lead to lost sales opportunity. In response, this research\nfocuses on providing proposition improvements for the UAV assembly business\nprocess,\nThis business process improvement research is initiated with thorough\nanalysis of bottleneck process in the existing UAV assembly process. Following the\nbottleneck process identification, we conduct root cause analyses and propose the\ncorresponding business process improvement propositions. Finally we assess the\nimpact of the solution propositions, define the required resources and provide a\nplan to implement the solution proposition.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK AKBAR AJIBASKORO.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/180798"}, "Penulis": "Akbar Ajibaskoro [19216053]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Meditya Wasesa, ST., MSc., PhD."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Kewirausahaan", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Business Process Improvement; Business Process Model; Bottleneck Analysis; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle; UAV Assembly Process", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Taupik Abidin", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Sep 2019"}
