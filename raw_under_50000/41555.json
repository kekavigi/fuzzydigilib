The peculiarities of the Terahertz Band, which is the envisioned\nfrequency band for communication among nano-devices, and the extreme energy limitations\nof nanosensors, which require the use of nanoscale energy harvesting systems, introduce\nmajor challenges in the design of MAC protocols for WNSNs. This paper aims to design\nenergy and spectrum-aware MAC protocols for WNSNs with the objective to achieve fair,\nthroughput and lifetime optimal channel access by jointly optimizing the energy harvesting\nand consumption processes in nanosensors. Towards this end, the critical packet transmission\nratio (CTR) is derived, which is the maximum allowable ratio between the transmission\ntime and the energy harvesting time, below which a nanosensor can harvest more energy\nthan the consumed one, thus achieving perpetual data transmission. Based on the CTR, first,\na novel symbol-compression scheduling algorithm, built on a recently proposed pulsebased\nphysical layer technique, is introduced. The symbol-compression solution utilizes\nthe unique elasticity of the inter-symbol spacing of the pulse-based physical layer to allow\na large number of nanosensors to transmit their packets in parallel without inducing collisions.\nIn addition, a packet-level timeline scheduling algorithm, built on a theoretical bandwidth-\nadaptive capacity-optimal physical layer, is proposed with an objective to achieve\nbalanced single-user throughput with infinite network lifetime. The simulation results\nshow that the proposed simple scheduling algorithms can enable nanosensors to transmit\nwith extremely high speed perpetually without replacing the batteries.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Pu Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Josep Miquel Jornet"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Nanosensors, Nanonetworks, MAC, Terahertz Band, Energy harvesting", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect, Ad Hoc Networks 11 (2013) 2541\u20132555", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Agu 2019"}
