{"Nomor": 46129, "Judul": "MODULAR DESIGN OF PEPTIDE- OR DNA-MODIFIED AIEGEN PROBES FOR BIOSENSING APPLICATIONS", "Abstrak": "Fluorophore probes are widely used for bioimaging in cells, tissues, and animals as well as for monitoring of multiple biological processes in complex environments. Such imaging properties allow scientists to make direct visualizations of pathological events and cellular targets. Conventional fluorescent molecules have been developed for several decades and achieved great successes, but their emissions are often weakened or quenched at high concentrations that might suffer from the aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect, which reduces the efficiencies of their applications. In contrast to the ACQ effect, aggregation-induced emission (AIE) luminogens (AIEgens) display much higher fluorescence in\naggregated states and possess various advantages such as low background, long-term tracking ability, and strong resistance to photobleaching. Therefore, AIEgens are employed as unique fluorescence molecules and building blocks for biosensing applications in the fields of ions, amino acids, carbohydrates, DNAs/RNAs, peptides/proteins, cellular organelles, cancer cells, bacteria, and so on.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Fan Xia [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jun Wu, Xia Wu, Qinyu Hu, Jun Dai, Xiaoding Lou"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Modular Design, Peptide- or DNA-Modified AIEgen Probes, Biosensing Applications", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Feb 2020"}
