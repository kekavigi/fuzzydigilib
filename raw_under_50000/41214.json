{"Nomor": 41214, "Judul": "MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONOF POLYMER/CARBONNANOTUBE COMPOSITES", "Abstrak": "In this paper, we present classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of model\npolymer/CNT composites constructed by embedding a single wall (10,10) CNT into two different\namorphous polymer matrices: poly(methyl methacrylate) and poly{(m-phenylene-vinylene)-co-\n[(2,5-dioctoxy-p-phenylene) vinylene]}, respectively, with different volume fractions. The simula-\ntion results support the idea that it is possible to use CNTs to mechanically reinforce an appropri-\nate polymer matrix, especially in the longitudinal direction of the nanotube. The comparison of\nthe simulation results with the macroscopic rule-of-mixtures for composite systems showed that\nfor strong interfacial interactions, there can be large deviations of the results from the rule-of-\nmixtures. In order to verify this study, results obtained have been compared with those given by\nElliott and Han (2007).", "Daftar File": {"2015 EJRNL PP Sumit Sharma 1.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/178240"}, "Penulis": "Sumit Sharma [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Rakesh Chandra, Pramod Kumar, Navin Kumar"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "nano-structures, elasticity, mechanical properties, computational modeling", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 4, August, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Jul 2019"}
