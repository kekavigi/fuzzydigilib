Higher passenger\ndensities, particularly during peak times of the day, have\nimplications for train punctuality, crowding, accessibility\nand passenger comfort. Research indicates that the design\nof the train carriage and the impediments of platform furniture all have an influence on accessibility and passenger\ndispersal, with consequences for service punctuality and\nnetwork capacity. Building new concepts in train and station design are expensive undertakings and carry with the\ninvestment a high level of risk. Computational simulation\nmethods such as agent-based modelling (ABM) can mitigate this risk at much lower cost. Many contemporary\nABM modellers represent passenger flow at a macroscale,\noften in a single plan view and with agents travelling at\nsame speeds and represented crudely as dots on a flat plane.\nThis paper discusses a body of work concerning the\nbuilding of a boarding and alighting simulator at a more\ndetailed scale where a deeper and richer experience of\ncrowd behaviour has been modelled using 3D animated\nfigures. The primary benefit of these methods of evaluation\nis that they take away the expense and lack of realism\npresent in experiments with full-size mock-ups. The outcomes of this work have resulted in sophisticated imagery,\nunderpinned by technical accuracy that provides a tool for\nthe development of station infrastructure, train carriage\ndesign with implications on timetabling and network\nplanning.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Selby Coxon [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Tom Chandler   \u2022 Elliott Wilson"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering of railroads & roads", "Kata Kunci": "Dwell time  Agent-based modelling  3D", "Sumber": "Urban Rail Transit (2015) 1(2):87\u201394", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Okt 2019"}
