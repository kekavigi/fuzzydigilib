{"Nomor": 43248, "Judul": "DESIGN AND VERIFICATION OF COOLING SYSTEM IN SUPERMARKET IN JAKARTA", "Abstrak": "In last decades, even the world has been concerned with global warming due to\nincreasing of energy demanded, energy need is still to be the main issues of threatened\nthe climate change. Furthermore, renewable energy has been growing year by year but\neven so it is small scale of energy consumption. Air conditioning systems in the\nbuilding can be conducted to find efficient systems to operate in the shopping mall.\nHourly Analysis Program was needed to simulate the load in the building to determine\nthe load profile hourly. In this case study, three alternative systems are used in the\nbuilding to find the lowest economic cost of each system. All three systems are watercooled\n\nchiller system with small capacity chiller and TES (option I), water-cooled\nchiller system with big capacity chiller and TES (option II), and magnetic bearing\nchiller system with high capacity without TES (option III).\n\nFor option I, this system can save the investment cost by around 14.7% and 23.7%\ncompared to option II and III, respectively. However, option III is the most energy\nefficient system. If we compare to the other options, this option can save around 10 %\nof operational cost. Moreover, the lower investment cost is the best choice for the\nowner. However, it gives the impact of operational cost which is paid by the owner in\nyears. \n\nBesides the investment cost, the life-cycle cost for twenty years, the option I is the best\nsystem. This system can save the operating cost up to 11.8% compared to option II,\nand 18% compared to option III. But the option I design without spare part which means\nget high rise after operating in years. Currently, according to the real load the system I\nis the best choice because it is still not run in full load. For Option II and III are use\nspare part. For option II can save the life cycle cost 7% in 20 years. Therefore, The\nOption II is the best choice if the system run in full load in future.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "23117702  [23117702]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
