Closed-form formulae for the effective elastic properties of\nthe composite are obtained. In a 3D sense, the resulting compliance tensor of the composite is\nsymmetric. Nevertheless, the 2D compliance tensor based on a deteriorated Mori-Tanaka\u2019s tensor\nis not symmetric. Nor is the compliance tensor defined upon a deteriorated 2D Eshelby\u2019s tensor.\nThe in-plane effective elastic properties given by those three approaches are different. A detailed\ncomparison between the predicted results obtained from those approaches with experimental data\navailable for a number of UD composites is made.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ling Liu  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Z he ng ming Huang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "micromechanics, Eshelby-Mori-Tanaka\u2019s method, effective elastic property, asymmetry", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 27, No. 3, June, 2014", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Jul 2019"}
