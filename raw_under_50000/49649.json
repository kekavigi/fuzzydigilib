To deliver the effective and continuity of energy transportation, the pipeline system is being used to transport oil and gas from the source to the user. To maintain the integrity of the system, assessment is required. The most common procedure is basically from stress-based design, but for high strain load, the stress-based method cannot be used. The strain-based design method is used to conduct an assessment of the integrity of the pipe where the plastic deformation is allowed a certain limit, but the reference of strain-based design is still limited.\nStrain based design methodology is the assessment and design method of pipe where the plastic deformation is allowed on the pipe at a certain limit. Three kinds of strain and deformation will be observed; tensile strain, compressive strain, and ovality of the pipe. The main principle of strain-based design is compared to the demanded strain obtained from the load, to the limit of the strain. There is four code that provides strain-based methodology and limit of the strain; DNV OS F101 2013, API RP 1111 2009, CSA Z662 and ASME B31.4 2019. The demand strain will be compared to the limit strain based on for code that has been stated.\nThe finite element study has been conducted using ANSYS and has been compared to a theoretical calculation to ensure its validity. The finite element analysis varied on the load, corrosion dimension, and pipe dimension. The tension test material is also conducted to select the plasticity model material. The corroded pipe will be analyzed and divided into three caseloads; Internal pressure, normal compressive force, and pure bending moment.\nThe effect of load and depth corrosion variation increases the strain for all cases. For width and length variation, the strain will be constant for all cases. For D/t ratio variation the strain will be increase if the ratio increase under internal pressure. But for a normal compressive and bending moment the ratio of cross-section area and the cross-section inertia will give better relation to the strain. Under the internal pressure case, the strain will be slightly increased for depth and load variation.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Fikri Barry Alfian": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/211651"}, "Penulis": "Fikri Barry Alfian [23119006]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
