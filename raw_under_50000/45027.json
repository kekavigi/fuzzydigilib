Although a rich variety of rotationally nonequivalent silicene structures have been observed with silicene grown on Ag(111) surfaces, the T phase, which has been considered a precursor phase, has a less-ordered structure, and thus, it is difficult to clarify its atomic structure. In this paper, we report the atomic structures of the T phase observed by high-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM). While scanning tunneling microscopy images of the T phase show characteristic round dots, AFM reveals that the T phase has a continuous Si honeycomb arrangement, thus forming silicene. We identify two types of T phases with different silicene rotation angles with respect to the Ag substrate: the (?13 \u00d7?13) type-I T phase and the tiling-pattern T phase. The former has a unit cell corresponding to the conventionally proposed (?13 \u00d7?13) type I with less periodicity of Si buckling, while the latter is identified by the tessellation with four different rhombuses. We also investigate the T phase by site-specific force spectroscopy and find that some\nSi atoms at the T phase have slightly different chemical reactivities.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jo Onoda [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Lingyu Feng, Keisuke Yabuoshi, and Yoshiaki Sugimoto"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS 3, 104002 (2019), APS", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Nov 2019"}
