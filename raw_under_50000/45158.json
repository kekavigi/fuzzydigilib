{"Nomor": 45158, "Judul": "Study On Temperature Distribution Along Wellbore Of Fracturing Horizontal Wells In Oil Reservoir", "Abstrak": "The application of distributed temperature sensors (DTS) to monitor producing zones of horizontal\nwell through a real-time measurement of a temperature profile is becoming increasingly popular.\nThose parameters, such as flow rate along wellbore, well completion method, skin factor, are\npotentially related to the information from DTS. Based on mass-, momentum-, and energy-balance\nequations, this paper established a coupled model to study on temperature distribution along\nwellbore of fracturing horizontal wells by considering skin factor in order to predict wellbore\ntemperature distribution and analyze the factors influencing the wellbore temperature profile. The\nmodels presented in this paper account for heat convective, fluid expansion, heat conduction, and\nviscous dissipative heating. Arriving temperature and wellbore temperature curves are plotted by\ncomputer iterative calculation. The non-perforated and perforated sections show different temperature distribution along wellbore. Through the study on the sensitivity analysis of skin factor\nand flow rate, we come to the conclusion that the higher skin factor generates larger temperature\nincrease near the wellbore, besides, temperature along wellbore is related to both skin factors and\nflow rate. Temperature response type curves show that the larger skin factor we set, the less\ntemperature augmenter fro", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "JUNJUN CAI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yonggang Duan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Hydraulic engineering", "Kata Kunci": "Temperature model, Oil reservoirs, Fracturing horizontal wells, Temperature distribution, Sensitivity analysis", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 4, Pages 358-365 (December  2015), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.10.003", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Nov 2019"}
