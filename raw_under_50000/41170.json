{"Nomor": 41170, "Judul": "DETERMINATIONOF FRACTURE TOUGHNESS OF BRITTLEMATERIALS BY INDENTATION", "Abstrak": "Fracture toughness is one of the crucial mechanical properties of brittle materials\nsuch as glasses and ceramics which demonstrate catastrophic failure modes. Conventional standardized\ntesting methods adopted for fracture toughness determination require large specimens\nto satisfy the plane strain condition. As for small specimens, indentation is a popular, sometimes\nexclusive testing mode to determine fracture toughness for it can be performed on a small flat area\nof the specimen surface. This review focuses on the development of indentation fracture theories\nand the representative testing methods. Cracking pattern dependent on indenter geometry and\nmaterial property plays an important role in modeling, and is the main reason for the diversity of\nindentation fracture theories and testing methods. Along with the simplicity of specimen requirement\nis the complexity of modeling and analysis which accounts for the semi-empirical features of\nindentation fracture tests. Some unresolved issues shaping the gap between indentation fracture\ntests and standardization are also discussed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yihui Feng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Taihua Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "indentation, fracture toughness, indenter geometry, cracking patterns", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 2, April, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Jul 2019"}
