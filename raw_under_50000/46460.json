{"Nomor": 46460, "Judul": "UNEQUAL MASS BINARY NEUTRON STAR SIMULATIONS WITH NEUTRINO TRANSPORT: EJECTA AND NEUTRINO EMISSION", "Abstrak": "We present 12 new simulations of unequal mass neutron star mergers. The simulations are performed\nwith the SpEC code, and utilize nuclear-theory-based equations of state and a two-moment gray neutrino\ntransport scheme with an improved energy estimate based on evolving the number density. We model the neutron stars with the SFHo, LS220, and DD2 equations of state (EOS) and we study the neutrino and matter emission of all 12 models to search for robust trends between binary parameters and emission characteristics. We find that the total mass of the dynamical ejecta exceeds 0.01 M? only for SFHo with weak dependence on the mass ratio across all models.We find that the ejecta have a broad electron fraction (Ye) distribution (?0.06\u20130.48), with mean 0.2. Ye increases with neutrino irradiation over time, but decreases with increasing binary asymmetry. We also find that the models have ejecta with a broad asymptotic velocity distribution (?0.05\u20130.7c). The average velocity lies in the range 0.2c ? 0.3c and decreases with binary asymmetry. Furthermore, we find that disk mass increases with binary asymmetry and stiffness of the EOS. The Ye of the disk increases with softness of the EOS. The strongest neutrino emission occurs for the models with soft EOS. For (anti) electron neutrinos we find no significant dependence of the magnitude or angular distribution or neutrino luminosity with mass ratio. The heavier neutrino species have a luminosity dependence on mass ratio but an angular distribution which does not change with mass ratio.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Trevor Vincent, [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Francois Foucart, Matthew D.
