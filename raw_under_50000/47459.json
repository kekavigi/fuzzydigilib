{"Nomor": 47459, "Judul": "CARDIOVASCULAR IMPACT OF MANUAL AND AUTOMATED TURNS IN ICU", "Abstrak": "Mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) are typically turned manually by nursing staff to reduce the risk of developing ventilator associated pneumonia and other problems in the lungs. However, turning can induce changes in the heart rate and blood pressure that can at times have a destabilizing effect. We report here on the early stage of a study that has been undertaken to measure the cardiovascular impact of manual turning, and compare it to changes induced when patients lie on automated beds that turn continuously. Heart rate and blood pressure data were analyzed over ensembles of turns with autoregressive models for comparing baseline level to the dynamic response. Manual turning stimulated a response in the heart rate that lasted for a median of 20 minutes and was of magnitude 5 to 13 bpm. The corresponding response in mean arterial pressure was 11 to 19 mm Hg, lasting for 8 to 21 minutes. There was no discernible response of either variable to automated turns.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Nikhil S.
