{"Nomor": 41260, "Judul": "RESEARCHON SOIL PRESSURE IN NINE CABINS OF OPENED BOTTOM ELLIPTICAL BARREL STRUCTURE USING PENETRATION OF NEGATIVE PRESSURE METHOD", "Abstrak": "An investigation is made on the soil pressure in a nine cabin opened bottom elliptical\nbarrel structure. The calculation models using the penetration of negative pressure method have\nbeen developed. The first calculation model is is for the construction stage involving three zones,\nnamely, passive, transitional, and active established for the soil pressure in cabins. The other\ncalculation model is based on the use stage, with the two (passive and active) zones for the soil\npressure in cabins. The height of zones and the theoretical analytical solutions of inner soil pressure\nare derived. The analytical formulas of the models are proved using the finite element method and\nexperimental data, and the formulas are analyzed in the inner soil pressure in the same condition.\nThe calculation models can be used for other multi-position structural design or construction.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xiaozhong Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "opened bottom elliptical barrel structure, soil pressure, calculation, passive zone, transitional zone, active zone", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 5, October, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Agu 2019"}
