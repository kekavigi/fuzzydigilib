The drivers were interviewed regardingsociodemographic characteristics, working conditions, behavior in traffic and involvement in accidentsor near-miss accidents in the previous 12 months. Subsequently, the participants answered a self-appliedquestionnaire on substance use. The time of professional experience as drivers was categorized in tertiles.Statistical analyses were performed through the construction of models adjusted by multinomial regres-sion to assess the relationship between the length of experience as a truck driver and the involvement inaccidents or near-miss accidents.Results: This study included 665 male drivers with an average age of 42.2 (\u00b111.1) years. Among them,7.2% and 41.7% of the drivers reported involvement in accidents and near-miss accidents, respectively. Infully adjusted analysis, the 3rd tertile of professional experience (>22 years) was shown to be inverselyassociated with involvement in accidents (odds ratio [OR] 0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.16-0.52)and near-miss accidents (OR 0.17; 95% CI 0.05-0.53). The 2nd tertile of professional experience (11\u201322years) was inversely associated with involvement in accidents (OR 0.63; 95% CI 0.40-0.98).Conclusions: An evident relationship was observed between longer professional experience and a reduc-tion in reporting involvement in accidents and near-miss accidents, regardless of age, substance use,working conditions and behavior in traffic.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Edmarlon Girottoa [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Selma Maffei de Andradeb, Alberto Dur\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lezb,Arthur Eumann Mesasba"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Traffic accidents, Professional experience, Truck drivers", "Sumber": "www.elsevier.com/locate/aap", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Jul 2019"}
