{"Nomor": 44696, "Judul": "Why Monorail Systems Provide a Great Solution for Metropolitan Areas", "Abstrak": "Faced with the escalating demand for public\ntransportation in metropolitan areas, transportation authorities are challenged to select a technology that will\nsatisfy the often conflicting demands of high capacity and\nreliable service, urban fit, minimized environmental impact\nand budget restrictions. There are many technologies\navailable today that can provide medium to high capacity\nmass transit service, however, in many cases these technologies are costly or are not suited to today\u2019s urban environment. High capacity has typically implied costly\nunderground tunneling or obtrusive elevated metro systems\nthat required extensive infrastructure disruption. Although\nmonorail systems have been around for some time, only\nrecent developments such as Bombardier\u2019s INNOVIA\nMonorail 300 System have permitted transit authorities to\nnow consider monorail as a mainstream contender to meet\ntheir mass transit requirements.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Peter E.
