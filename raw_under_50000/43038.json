{"Nomor": 43038, "Judul": "A Modal Control based Fully Rated Converter for Damping Torsional Oscillations in Large Turbo-generators", "Abstrak": "This paper introduces a new method for damping the\nSub-Synchronous Resonance (SSR) in electrical power systems.\nThe proposed technique is based on utilizing the main controllers\nof Fully Rated Converter-based wind turbines (FRC-WTs). Two\nauxiliary controllers are added to the main controllers of the\nconverter and designed to damp the unstable torsional oscillatory\nmodes. FRC-WTs is connected with the IEEE First Benchmark\nsystem for SSR to perform the studies. The effectiveness of the\nproposed controller on damping the unstable torsional oscillatory\nmodes over a wide range of series compensation is investigated.\nMATLAB code is developed and used to perform frequency\ndomain analysis and the results are verified by digital timedomain\nsimulations. The present study shows that coordination\nof the two main controllers, with added auxiliary signals, of the\nFRC-WTs can significantly increase the electrical system\ndamping to the torsional oscillatory modes.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jomana Mohsen [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Rizk M.
