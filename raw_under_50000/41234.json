{"Nomor": 41234, "Judul": "Classification, extraction and current analytical approaches for detection of pesticides in various food products", "Abstrak": "In recent years, food safety and environmental concerns became a significant issue, especially in developing countries.\nPesticides have been applied broadly in agriculture to enhance the production and quality of the agricultural products and in\norder to decrease the energy cost. Pesticides are non-biodegradable chemical compounds and commonly used in agriculture\nfor pest control and to increase yield production. However, excessive usage of pesticides may cause severe health problems\nas well as environmental pollution, even at low concentrations. Hence, a lot of research is focused on methods to determine\nthe presence of pesticides in different food matrices. It is imperative to develop sensitive detection methods for reliable\nquantification of the presence of pesticides. This review critically emphasizes recent literature from 2015 to 2019 and an\nup-to-date overview of analytical methods as well as extraction methods to detect pesticide residues in various food\nsamples.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Nurul Shaeera Sulaiman [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Kobun Rovina, Vonnie Merillyn Joseph"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Agriculture & related technologies", "Kata Kunci": "Pesticides,  Carbamate,  Organophosphorus,  Analytical method,  Conventional method,  Nanotechnology", "Sumber": "Journal of Consumer Protection and Food Safety, Journal f\u00fcr Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit ISSN: 1661-5751 (Print) 1661-5867 (Online)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos \u00a0\n                                     Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Agu 2019"}
