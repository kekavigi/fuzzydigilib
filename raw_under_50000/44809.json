{"Nomor": 44809, "Judul": "Characterization Of Pore Volume Of Cumulative Water Injection Distribution", "Abstrak": "Pore volume of Cumulative water injection is one of the factors for evaluating water flood effect in a\nwater flood oil field. In previous study, there were limited lab studies for evaluating oil displacement efficiency. A method to characterize the distribution of pore volume of cumulative water\ninjection is proposed in this paper, and it is verified by a five-spot water flooding streamline\nsimulation model. The logarithmic relation between pore volume of cumulative water injection and\nwater saturation is established by regression. An inflection point and limit point of cumulative\nwater injection pore volume are identified. Current simulation model indicates inflection point\nappears after 2e5 pore volume (PV) injection, and limit point appears after 15e25 PV injection.\nBoth inflection and limit point vary in different regions of reservoir.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "GUOQING FENG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["MingLe Yu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "Water drive reservoir, Cumulative water injection pore volume, Numerical flow simulation, Inflection point, Limit point, Recovery factor", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 2, Pages 158-163 (September  2015),    http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.03.007", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Nov 2019"}
