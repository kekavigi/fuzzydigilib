{"Nomor": 44785, "Judul": "VARIASI PERMUKAAN LAUT PADA KEJADIAN EL-NINO DAN IOD PADA TAHUN 2015-2016 DI PERAIRAN INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "The focus of this study is to investigate whether ENSO and DMI phenomenon have any\ninfluence on the sea surface temperature on Indonesian Sea. This study used the data from\nAQUA MODIS satellite and sea surface temperature data from 1982-2013. By comparing the\naverage monthly satellite data from January 2015- May 2016 to the data from 1982-2013,\nthis study will be able to see how the sea surface temperature in Indonesia Seas are\ninfluenced by the presence of ENSO and DMI phenomenon.\nIn the Eastern part of Indian Ocean, specifically in the southern part of Java Island, the sea\nsurface temperature can be as low as 25 C in September. The same number for sea surface\ntemperature can also be found in the Arafura Sea in September 2015, while the highest sea\nsurface temperature in both Arafura Sea and the Eastern part of the Indian Ocean can be as\nhigh as 29 C in January 2015 and January 2016. For the Java Sea and Banda Sea, these two\nis located in the middle part of the Indonesia and only shown the little influence from the\nENSO and DMI phenomenon. However, there is an anomaly in Banda Sea around August\n2015, the sea surface temperature there is shown to be dropping as low as 25 C. almost every\nsea in Indonesia is influenced by the ENSO and DMI phenomenon. However, the amount of\ninfluence ENSO and DMI has depends on the size and the place of the sea.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Rania Permata Kurnia [12910005]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ivonne Milichristi Radjawane, S.Si., M.Si., Ph.D.", "Farrah Hanifah, S.Si., M.Si."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Oseanografi", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Ilmu dan Teknologi Kebumian", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "ENSO, Sea Surface Temperature, DMI", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti \u00a0\n                                     Alice Diniarti", "File": "6 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Nov 2019"}
