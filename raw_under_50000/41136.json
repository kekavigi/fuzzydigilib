The asymptotic solutions for thermal responses induced by\ntransient thermal shock are derived by means of the limit theoremof Laplace transform. An infinite\nsolid with a cylindrical cavity subjected to a thermal shock at its inner boundary is studied. The\npropagation of thermal wave and thermal elastic wave, as well as the distributions of displacement,\ntemperature and stresses are obtained from these asymptotic solutions. The investigation on the\neffect of fractional order parameter on the propagation of two waves is also conducted.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yingze Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dong Li, Qian Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "generalized thermoelasticity, fractional order theory, asymptotic solutions, thermal shock", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 3, June, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Jul 2019"}
