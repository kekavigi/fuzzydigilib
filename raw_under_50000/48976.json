The problem of well productivity is sometimes only viewed from the\nsurface components themselves, where in fact the subsurface component often has a significant effect on these\nproduction figures. In order to track the relationship between surface and subsurface, a model that integrates both must\nbe created. The methods covered integrated asset modeling, probabilistic forecasting, uncertainty quantification, and\nsensitivity analysis. Subsurface uncertainties examined were: reservoir closure, regional segmentation, fluid contact,\nand SCAL properties. As the Integrated Asset Modeling is successfully conducted and several cases of production\nprobability forecasting are obtained, up to \u00b175% of reservoir uncertainty range variable value conducted yields various\nof production forecasting with the best probabilistic case obtained for \u201cK\u201d Field is 176.6 - 254.4 BSCF gas production\nand 273.7 \u2013 329.5 MSTB oil production. The main five reservoir uncertainty that affects gas and oil production of the\nfield are: Corey curvature (Ng), relative permeability of gas (Krg), oil-to-water critical saturation (Sowcr), gas-to-oil critical\nsaturation (Sogcr), and pseudo-fault. As condensate production is highly possible to occur and gives the NPV a significant\neffect, EOS and rock compressibility modeling must be evaluated in detail. A production scenario for future\ndevelopment with up to 151.58 BSCF gas and 414.4 MSTB oil that yields a NPV of 102.6 MMUSD is proposed. The\napproach and methods implemented has been proven to acquire the more accurate production forecast and reduce the\nproject cost as the effect of uncertainty reduction.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Alysia Chaterine [12216036]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Silvya Dewi Rahmawati, S.Si., M.Si., Ph.D.", "Ahmad Reizky Azhar, S.T., M.Sc."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "integrated asset modeling, probability forecasting, uncertainty, sensitivity analysis, field optimization", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Agu 2020"}
