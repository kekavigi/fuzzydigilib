{"Nomor": 46073, "Judul": "THREE-COORDINATE FORMAL COBALT(0), IRON(0), AND MANGANESE(0) COMPLEXES WITH PERSISTENT CARBENE AND ALKENE LIGATION", "Abstrak": "Low-coordinate transition-metal species, i.e., metal species with\ncoordination numbers of less than 4, represent a category of ubiquitous reactive\nintermediates in metal-catalyzed reactions that take place in solution, in\nmetalloenzymes, on supported nanomaterials and single-atom catalysts, and so\non. While reactive intermediates are usually transient and hard to isolate, which\nmakes detailed investigation challenging, molecular representatives of lowcoordinate\ntransition-metal intermediates can be synthesized by the judicious use\nof supporting ligands, allowing detailed study of their inherent chemical and\nphysical properties. By the use of bulky nitrogen- and oxygen-based anionic\nligands, plenty of three- and two-coordinate group 4?10 metal complexes ..", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yang Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jun Cheng, Liang Deng"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Persistent Carbene, Alkene Ligation", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Feb 2020"}
