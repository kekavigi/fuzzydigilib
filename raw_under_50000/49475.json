{"Nomor": 49475, "Judul": "AUTOMATIC PROTECTION IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERING PROTECTION ASSESSMENT METHOD OF DER PENETRATION FOR SMART DISTRIBUTION NETWORK", "Abstrak": "Indonesia has a lot of potential for renewable energy resources. Due to Indonesian\ngeographical locations which had a tropical climate condition and where many\nabundant water flows can easily be found, some technology such as Hydro and\nSolar Photovoltaic are very attractive to be used and developed. Distribution Energy\nResources (DER) is the appropriate schemes implemented to achieve optimal\noperation respecting the location and capacity of the plant. However, DER\u2019s has\nsome downsides, especially in the aspect of protection. The Gorontalo sub-system\nnetwork was chosen as a case study considering both of micro-hydro and PV as\ncontributed to supply the grid.\nThe needs for a smart electrical system are required to improve reliability, power\nquality, and adaptation to any circumstances during DER application. While the\ntopology was changing over time, intermittent of DER output and bidirectional\npower flow can be overcome with smart grid systems.\nIn this study, an automation algorithm has been conducted to aid the engineers in\nsolving the protection problems caused by DER implementation. The protection\nSecurity Assessment (PSA) method is used to evaluate the state of the protection\nsystem. Determine the relay settings using an adaptive rule-based method on expert\nsystems. The application with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been developed\nto make user easier to get the specific relay settings and locations which are\nsensitive, fast, reliable, and selective.", "Daftar File": {"Cover": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/211330", "Abstract": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/211332", "Lembar Pengesahan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/211333", "Tesis": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/211334"}, "Penulis": "Misbakhul Fajri [23218025]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
