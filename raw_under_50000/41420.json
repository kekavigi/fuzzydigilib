First, the elastic, piezoelectric and\npiezomagnetic coefficients in the considered ordinate systemare obtained byBonde transformation\nfrom those in the crystal axis ordinate system. Then, the secular equation of surface wave is derived\nfromthe free traction condition on the surface of half space with consideration of short/open circuit\ncase. Some numerical examples are given. The direction dependence of surface wave speed and\nthe influences of short/open circuit are shown graphically and discussed based on the numerical\nresults.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Li Li  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Peijun Wei"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "surface wave, piezoelectric and piezomagnetic, short and open circuit, Bonde trans- formation, piezoelectric enhanced effects", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect, Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 1, February, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Agu 2019"}
