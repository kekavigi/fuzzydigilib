{"Nomor": 44524, "Judul": "SEBUAH MODEL BERBASIS PENGETAHUAN UNTUK PENGENDALIAN FORMASI SISTEM ROBOT MAJEMUK", "Abstrak": "Study of multi-robot system has been popular in recent years. This system is able to\nreduce processing time of some processes, the cost and complexity of the system. However,\nmulti-robot system also has some problems. One of the problems faced by these systems is\nhow to control robots in a certain formation when carrying out its functions. Several methods\nhave been offered to resolve the existing problems. This study tries to offer a method to solve\nthe problem, by modeling the multi-robot systems and implement a control system in order to\nmaintain a specific formation. The study attempted to use a controller based on knowledge base\nsystem. Model is developed using MATLAB software and simulated to determine the\nperformance. Several experiments are conducted to determine the movement of the robot and\nits ability to maintain a specific formation. From the experiments it can be said that the modeling\nof multiple-robot system has been reliable. In addition, formation control actions have also been\nrunning well, although there should be further development.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Andi Adriansyah [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "formation control, knowledge based, modeling system, multi-robot system", "Sumber": "TELKOMNIKA: Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering ISSN: 1693-6930, e-ISSN: 2087-278X", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Okt 2019"}
