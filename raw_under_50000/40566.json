Nikki Kopelman) MIT Press (2019) On 3 September 2014, Earth got a new \u2018cosmic address\u2019. Laniakea (Hawaiian for \u2018immense heaven\u2019) is a gargantuan supercluster folding\nin more than one million galaxies along with our own. This Englishlanguage edition of the award-winning primer by astrophysicist H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Courtois, a member of the team that described Laniakea, interweaves\ncosmographical challenges with backstory (and groundbreakers such as Vera Rubin) and engaging glimpses of Courtois\u2019 own career. She nods, too, to post-Laniakea finds such as the cosmic velocity web.
