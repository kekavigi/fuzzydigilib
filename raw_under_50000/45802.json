{"Nomor": 45802, "Judul": "Pb(II) deposition-reduction-growth onto iron nanoparticles induced by graphitic carbon nitride", "Abstrak": "Enhanced stability and prolonged reactivity of nanoparticles are critical factors for successful applications of the nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) technology. In this work, g-C3N4 was employed as a support for distributing, stabilizing nZVI and further changing the composition, microstructure and electronic structure of nZVI due to the interactions between the iron nanoparticles and g-C3N4 sheet. Adjusting the micro-structure of nZVI to enhance the adsorption ability........", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Chenliu Tang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Lan Linga, Wei-xian Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI), g-C3N4, Water treatment", "Sumber": "Chemical Engineering Journal journal, www.elsevier.com/locate/cej", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan \u00a0\n                                     hidayat", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Jan 2020"}
