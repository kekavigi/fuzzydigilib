{"Nomor": 45107, "Judul": "A Comprehensive Investigation On The Performance Of Durian Rind As A Lost Circulation Material In Water Based Drilling Mud", "Abstrak": "Oil and gas operators worldwide are expecting service companies to deliver integrated techniques to minimize, if\nnot prevent, drilling problems. Drilling fluids perform vital functions to ensure the success of drilling operations.\nThe technical challenges often associated with water-based drilling fluids are loss of critical properties, such as\nfluid loss control and rheology, under demanding conditions, such as in drilling deeper, high-temperature and\nhigh-pressure wells. Fluid loss during drilling operations has a very significant effect in both reservoir formation\ndamage and monetary terms. The use of durian rind (DR) as a new additive in controlling lost circulation would\nprovide another opportunity to reduce waste and avoid pollution. Therefore, DR was used to improve the\nrheological properties of water-based mud, and it was prepared for use as a fluid loss additive. For a better\nunderstanding of the influence of pectin on drilling mud properties, the rheological evaluation of untreated DR\nwas compared to that of mud samples containing treated DR. The pectin in DR was extracted using four different\nsolvents, namely, ethanol, methanol, sodium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide, and the most effective solvent to\nremove the pectin was then determined. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results showed that\nNaOH was the best solvent for removing pectin from DR. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to determine the thermal stability of DR before and after treatments. The TGA results demonstrated that the treated\nDR had improved thermal stability compared to untreated DR. The sizes of DR used were coarse, medium, and\nfine. The untreated DR presented better rheological properties than the treated DR.
