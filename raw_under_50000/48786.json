ON ASCARIS SUUM", "Abstrak": "Ascariasis is a type of disease that is caused by Ascaris lumbricoides. It was estimated that it infects\nup to 1.2 billion of population in the world. It can cause some serious complications such as\npulmonary hypersensitivity, anemia, etc. The objective of this in-vitro study is to determine the\nanthelminthic activity of Piperaceae (P. betle L., P. nigrum, P. sarmentosum Roxb.) against Ascaris\nsuum. The concentration of the plant extract used was 10mg/mL and 50mg/mL for each of the plant.\nThe worms was placed inside a petri dish containing the tested extract and the time taken of paralysis\nwas observed every 30 minutes as well as the type of paralysis. All of the plant extracts showed a\nsignificant anthelminthic activity against Ascaris suum. The time taken to flaccid paralysis that was\nobserved for 10mg/mL of P. betle L., P. nigrum, and P. sarmentosum Roxb. was 7.0 \u00b1 0.4082 hours,\n5.50 \u00b1 0.7071 hours, and 7.875 \u00b1 0.25 hours respectively. Whereas for 50mg/mL, the time taken to\nflaccid paralysis was 4.5 \u00b1 0.7071 hours, 4.00 \u00b1 0.4082 hours, and 4.875 \u00b1 0.4787 hours for P. betle L.,\nP. nigrum, and P. sarmentosum Roxb. respectively. Based on this study, it can be concluded that all\nof the plant extracts (P. betle L., P. nigrum, P. sarmentosum Roxb.) possess an anthelminthic activity\nagainst A. suum. All the extracts have significant difference compared to control negative. However,\nthe effect is not as good as pyrantel pamoate as reference group.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Syaza Ilyana Bt.
