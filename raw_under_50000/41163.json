{"Nomor": 41163, "Judul": "EFFECTIVE MULTI-FIELD PROPERTIES OF ELECTRO-MAGNETO-THERMOELASTIC COMPOSITES ESTIMATED BY FINITE ELEMENT METHOD APPROACH", "Abstrak": "A finite element approach based on the micromechanics was performed to estimate\nthe multi-field properties of electro-magneto-thermoelastic composites. The thermal field and the\ninvolved pyroelectric and pyromagnetic effect of the multi-phase composite materials were taken\ninto account in the investigation and implemented in the finite element modeling. The multifields\nrelated to the electric field, magnetic field, deformation and temperature field, as well as\ntheir coupling effects of the smart composites under periodic boundary conditions were obtained\nnumerically. Especially, by means of the homogenization approximation, the effective thermal expansion\ncoefficients, pyroelectric coefficients, pyromagnetic coefficients and other elastic, electric,\nand magnetic properties for the piezoelectric material, piezomagnetic material and magnetoelectric\nmaterial were calculated, respectively. Some results are compared to the theoretical predictions\nby the well-known Mori-Tanaka method to show good agreements.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zhichao Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xingzhe Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "multi-field property, electro-magneto-thermoelastic composite, pyroelectric and pyromagnetic effect, FEM of micromechanics", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 2, April, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Jul 2019"}
