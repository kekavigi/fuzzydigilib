{"Nomor": 40909, "Judul": "Assessment of spatial distribution and cysts resources of Artemia in late autumn in Dangxiong Co salt lake", "Abstrak": "Based on the vertically interval sampling in 25 sampling sites in Dangxiong Co salt lake in 2011, a preliminary\ninvestigation on population spatial distribution and cysts resources of Artemia in the lake has\nbeen conducted. The study achieves four new progresses. First, the average density of Artemia and Artemia\ncysts in the lake is 4.157  103 ind. m2 and 8.069  104 ind. m2, respectively. Among Artemia,\nthe adults account for 60.31%; Second, different from other salt lakes in horizontal distribution, the Artemia\npopulation mainly distributes in the open water, only a little in the shallow water, and there is no\ndistribution in the longshore area in the north part and the estuary region; Third, in vertical distribution,\n44.24% of individuals intensively distribute in the upper water layer within 2.0 m, especially 0\u20130.2 m,\nwhere the average density of Artemia and cysts are maximum (129.488 ind. L1 and 5.728 ind. L1,\nrespectively). A decrease of distribution density is accompanied by an increase of water depth basically,\nthe percentage of Artemia and cysts decrease to 0.68% and 4.60%, respectively; Fourth, the cysts resources of 14.96 t in the lake are assessed using contour map. 66.35% of them distributed in 0.0\u20132.0 m water layer and 49.06% concentrate in the 18.21% areas of the central water; Fifth, quantity of cysts suitable for development in the lake is 2.399 \u00b1 0.320 t, with an upper limit of 0.879 t. The study can provide a reference for the sustainable development and exploitation of Artemia in Dangxiong Co salt lake.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Shasha Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xifang Liu, Qinxian Jia, Fanjing Kong, Mianping Zheng, Guangjun Lv"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Artemia population, Spatial distribution, Cysts resource estimation, Dangxiong Co salt lake", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Jul 2019"}
