{"Nomor": 41159, "Judul": "A Novel Imidazoline Derivative As Corrosion Inhibitor For P110 Carbon Steel In Hydrochloric Acid Environment", "Abstrak": "A novel imidazoline derivative, 2-methyl-4-phenyl-1-tosyl-4, 5-dihydro-1H-imidazole (IMI), was\nprepared and investigated as corrosion inhibitor for P110 carbon steel in 1.0 M HCl solution by\nweight loss measurements, potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests. The inhibition efficiency increased with the rising concentration of IMI inhibitor. The test results and fitting data indicated that the IMI behaved as a mixed-type inhibitor\nand obeys the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out\nto investigate the surface of carbon steel specimens, showing great protection from aggressive\nsolution. Finally, inhibition mechanism of IMI on metal surface was further discussed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "LEI ZHANG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yi He", "Yanqiu Zhou", "Ranran Yang", "Qiangbin Yang", "Dayong Qing", "Qianhe Niu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Carbon steel, Weight loss, Electrochemical, SEM, Langmuir adsorption", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 3, Pages 237-243 (September  2015), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.10.007", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Jul 2019"}
