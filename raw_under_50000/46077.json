Why then, after so many years of the\ndocumented benefits of electrochemistry, is it not more widely\nembraced by mainstream practitioners? Erroneous perceptions\nthat electrochemistry is a \u201cblack box\u201d combined with a\nlack of intuitive and inexpensive standardized equipment\nlikely contributed to this stagnation in interest within the ..", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Cian Kingston [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Maximilian D.
