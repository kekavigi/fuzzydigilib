{"Nomor": 45005, "Judul": "Characteristics of swimming shelled Antarctic pteropods (Limacina helicina antarctica) at intermediate Reynolds number regime", "Abstrak": "The swimming characteristics achieved by flapping wings, translating motion, and\nshell pitching are studied from observations of shelled Antarctic pteropods (aquatic\nsnails nicknamed \u201csea butterflies\u201d). These pteropods (Limacina helicina antarctica) swim\nwith a pair of parapodia (or \u201cwings\u201d) via a unique flapping propulsion mechanism that\nincorporates similar techniques as observed in small flying insects. The geometric scaling\nof the wing span (L), wing chord (c), and minor shell diameter (d) with respect to the major\nshell diameter (D) reveal geometric similitude. Thus, the major shell diameter (D) is the\nonly length scale required to describe the size of the pteropods. The motion of swimming\npteropods is characterized using flapping, translational, and rotational Reynolds numbers\n(i.e., Ref, ReU, and Re). A critical value of the flapping Reynolds number, Ref = 35,\nis found for the onset of translating and pitching locomotion. Finally, the relationship is\nobtained for the Strouhal number (StA = f A/U) for the pteropods using the geometric\nscalings and the translational and flapping Reynolds numbers. The Strouhal number is\nfound to be between 0.2 and 0.4, which indicates general agreement with other oscillating\norganisms moving with high propulsion efficiency.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mohammad Mohaghar [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Deepak Adhikari, and Donald R.
