{"Nomor": 40924, "Judul": "Study on optimization of moisture retention for golf green rootzone soil mixtures", "Abstrak": "Most golf course green have been constructed with pure sand or sand-based rootzone mixes. As we know,\nhigh sand content provides rapid drainage despite sand\u2019s inefficiency in retaining moisture. However,\ndrainage capability and water retention are both essential elements to the golf course green, and the\naddition of peat could increase the soil moisture retention, therefore, the research on the drainage capability\nand water retention of the sandy golf green has become more and more important these years. In\nthis study, extreme vertex design was applied which is one of the mixture experiment designs widely\nused in mixture experiments, the study investigated the effects of the thirteen different rootzone soil\nmixtures using middle-coarse, fine sand, very fine sand plus silt and clay as well as peat as the materials\nunder three kinds of golf green profile (1-layer profile, 2-layer profile, 3-layer profile) conditions on the\nwater retention of green rootzone. Through the qualitative, quantitative and optimization analysis of\nwater retention capability of the sandy golf green, evidence a basis for choice of green profiles and rootzone matrix could be provided.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yin Shao-Hua [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Chang Zhi-Hui , Han Lie-Bao, Lu Xin-Shi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Golf course green, Soil profile, Rootzone soil mixtures", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Jul 2019"}
