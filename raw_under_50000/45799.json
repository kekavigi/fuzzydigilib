The physicochemical properties and morphologies of these heterostructured photocatalysts are characterized by various spectroscopies such as XRD, XPS, TEM/SEM, PL, FT-IR, UV\u2013Visible spectroscopy and nitrogen adsorption measurements. The prepared g-C3N4/Bi2WO6/3 wt% rGO photocatalysts (incorporated with optimal 3 wt% of rGO) possess ca.....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Shou-Heng Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wen-Ting Tang, Pei-Hsin Chou"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "2D/2D/2D heterojunctions, Emerging contaminants, Visible-light-driven, Bioassay tests, Wastewater purification", "Sumber": "Chemical Engineering Journal journal, www.elsevier.com/locate/cej", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan \u00a0\n                                     Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Jan 2020"}
