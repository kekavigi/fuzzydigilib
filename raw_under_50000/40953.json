{"Nomor": 40953, "Judul": "Soil respiration and the contribution of root respiration of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) in arid region", "Abstrak": "In northwest China, cotton field is the main cropping system in dry-land agriculture system, and the root\nrespiration of cotton is an important component for the local carbon cycling. Our objectives were to characterize\nthe temporal variation of soil respiration (Rt) and the contribution of root respiration of cotton. A\nfield study was conducted to estimate root respiration by gap information method, and divide the components\nof root respiration (Rr) and heterotrophic respiration (Rh). Soil respiration was measured by using\nCIRAS chamber from August to October in 2012...", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yongxiang Yu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Chengyi Zhao a, Zhimin Zhao, Bo Yu, Tianhe Zhou"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Soil respiration, Root respiration, Soil temperature", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Jul 2019"}
