{"Nomor": 44856, "Judul": "Intermittent And Short Duration Ultrasound In A Simulated Porous Medium", "Abstrak": "Ultrasound is an unconventional method used to recovery oil, despite the report on the use of this\ntechnique, the focus has always been on the continuous application of ultrasound. But the continuous\nultrasound has its own limitation of high cost of production and maintenance of equipment because of\nhigh energy generated. In this study, the use of short duration, intermittent ultrasound was investigated,\nand the result compared with the continuous ultrasound. The effect of viscosity and intensity on both\nintermittent and continuous ultrasound was also investigated. A 2D micro-model placed inside an ultrasonic bath under an ultrasound radiation was used, a stereo microscope with the camera mounted at\nthe top of the micro-model recorded the displacement process. The snapshot of each time interval was\nused to give the estimate in percentage (%) of the residual oil left in the micro-model. The results show\nthat, short duration and intermittent ultrasound can recover more oil compared with the application\nusing continuous ultrasound and longer duration. Therefore, the use of intermittent ultrasound as a\ngreen and cost-effective technique is herein proposed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "AUGUSTINE AGI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Radzuan Junin", "Mohd Faddli Syamsul", "Aik Shye Chong", "Afeez Gbadamosi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "Ultrasonic, Intermittent ultrasound, Continuous ultrasound, Micro-model, Porous media, Enhanced oil recovery", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 5, Issue 1, Pages 42-51 (March  2019), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.03.012", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Nov 2019"}
