{"Nomor": 45803, "Judul": "Highly efficient and selective pillararene-based organic materials for Hg2+ and CH3Hg+ extraction from aqueous solution", "Abstrak": "Pillararenes, a rising star in macrocyclic chemistry, are recognized as promising organic materials for metal ion\nseparation. Herein, three novel pillar[5]arenes (1a-c) appended with N,N-dimethyldithiocarbamoyl groups were\ndesigned for highly efficient extraction of aqueous mercury. This work represents the first case of using pillararene- based materials for organic mercury removal, and rather low Hg(II) residue (3.45 ppb) was found in the extraction raffinate of mercury spiked river water after being treated with the as-prepared extractants, which is a rare example of solvent............", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lixi Chena [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": [", Ying Wanga, Yaoshuang Wana, Yimin Caia"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Pillararene, Mercury remediation, Methylmercury, Solvent extraction", "Sumber": "Chemical Engineering Journal journal, www.elsevier.com/locate/cej", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Jan 2020"}
