{"Nomor": 45462, "Judul": "ANTI-RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS EFFECT OF SUN BEAR (HELARCTOS MALAYANUS) AND COBRA SNAKE (NAJA SPUTATRIX) BILES ON COLLAGEN-INDUCED ARTHRITIS RAT MODEL", "Abstrak": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder that affects primarily the joints and\nis characterized by chronic inflammation and synovial hyperplasia, pannus tissue which\nleading to the destruction of cartilage and bone. Sun bear gallbladder (Xiong Dan in\nChinese) and cobra snake gallbladder (She Dan in Chinese) contain an appreciable fraction\nof different types of bile acids have been used widely in Traditional Chinese Medicine\n(TCM) in treating variety of diseases. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the anti-\nrheumatoid arthritis activity of sun bear and cobra snake biles on female Wistar rats.\nFemale rats were previously induced to have RA by subcutaneously injected with bovine\ntype II collagen emulsified in Complete Freund\u2019s Adjuvant (CFA), followed by a booster\ndose of bovine collagen type II emulsified in Incomplete Freund\u2019s Adjuvant (IFA) injected\nthrough tail. Sun bear and cobra snake biles were prepared by dissolving biles in water.\nThe CIA rats were divided into 6 groups which are control group (water only), test groups:\nsun bear bile at dose 0.225 and 0.1125 g/kg; cobra snake bile at dose 0.27 and 0.135 g/kg\nand methylprednisolone 45mg/kg as reference group. All the rats in each group were given\norally for 21 days. The parameters determined were macroscopic scoring, TNF-?and\nhistopathological study of rat hindlimb tissues. Based on the data of arthritis score, sun\nbear bile at dose 0.225 and 0.1125 g/kg and snake bile at dose 0.27 and 0.135 g/kg can\ndecreased arthritis score significantly (p<0.05). There is no significant difference of\narthritis score after treated with standard (methylprednisolone) with all the treatment\ngroups. In determination of TNF-?level, sun bear bile at dose 0.225 and 0.1125 g/kg and\nsnake bile at dose 0.27 g/kg showed a significant reduction of TNF-?(p<0.05) as\ncompared to control group. Histological analysis showed sun bear bile at dose 0.225 and\n0.1125 g/kg and cobra snake bile at dose 0.27 g/kg have ability to protect cartilage from\nerosion. Sun bear bile at dose 0.225 and 0.1125 g/kg and cobra snake bile at dose 0.27 g/kg\nhave anti-rheumatoid arthritis effect in CIA rat model.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Lim Lee Yie": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/193136"}, "Penulis": "Lim Lee Yie [10711707]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Maria Immaculata Iwo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sains dan Teknologi Farmasi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Farmasi", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "--", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Des 2019"}
