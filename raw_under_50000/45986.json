{"Nomor": 45986, "Judul": "DScribe: Library of descriptors for machine learning in materials science", "Abstrak": "DScribe is a software package for machine learning that provides popular feature transformations (\u2018\u2018descriptors\u2019\u2019) for atomistic materials simulations. DScribe accelerates the application of machine learning for atomistic property prediction by providing user-friendly, off-the-shelf descriptor implementations. The package currently contains implementations for Coulomb matrix, Ewald sum matrix, sine matrix, Many-body Tensor Representation (MBTR), Atom-centered Symmetry Function (ACSF) and Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP). Usage of the package is illustrated for two different applications: formation energy prediction for solids and ionic charge prediction for atoms in organic molecules. The package is freely available under the open-source Apache License 2.0.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lauri Himanen [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Marc O.J. J\u00e4ger a, Eiaki V.
