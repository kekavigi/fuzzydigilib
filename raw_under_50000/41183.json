{"Nomor": 41183, "Judul": "ROCKINITIATIONAND PROPAGATION SIMULATIONUNDER COMPRESSION-SHEAR LOADING USING CONTINUOUS-DISCONTINUOUS CELLULAR AUTOMATONMETHOD", "Abstrak": "A continuous-discontinuous cellular automaton method is developed for rock ini-\ntiation and propagation simulations, in which the level set method, discontinuous enrichment\nshape functions and discontinuous cellular automaton are combined. No remeshing is needed for\ncrack growth analysis, and all calculations are restricted to cells without an assembled global stiff-\nness matrix. The frictional contact theory is employed to construct the contact model of normal\npressure and tangential shear on crack surfaces. A discontinuous cellular automaton updating\nrule suitable for frictional contact of rock is proposed simultaneously with Newton\u2019s iteration\nmethod for nonlinear iteration. Besides, a comprehensive fracturing criterion for brittle rock under\ncompression-shear loading is developed. The accuracy and effectivenesss of the proposed method\nis proved by numerical simulation.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Fei Yan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiating Feng, Peng zhi Pan, Shaojun Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "continuous-discontinuous cellular automaton method, rock fracturing process, compression- shear loading, frictional contact, comprehensive fracturing criterion", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 4, August, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Jul 2019"}
