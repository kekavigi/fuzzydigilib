This corridor is planned to accommodate passengers commuting from Pulo Gebang to Joglo. The construction of this corridor is divided into two phases, the 1st phase (Pulo Gebang \u2013 Karet) is 20,6 km long while the 2nd phase (Karet \u2013 Joglo III) is 12,35 km long. In this Thesis, the design is focused on the transportation aspects of the 1st phase, especially on the Depo \u2013 Klender Baru segment. Thus, in order to achive the plan, a project construction management design is needed, which includes construction methods, project scheduling, and project cost estimation.\nThe construction method in this project is divided into 4 (four) main works. Those are preparation work, lower structure work, upper structure work, and railway work. All structural works, except for girders, are planned to use reinforced concrete system. For girders, this project will use presetressed concrete system, which is I-shaped or generally called as PCI Girder.\nBased on the planning results, the total duration to build this project is 238 days, from September 1st 2020 to May 1st 2021, and the total project cost to finish this project is Rp 482,131,094,331.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lucia Brena Amenda Lolita Semb [15016016]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
