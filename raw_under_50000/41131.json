Two\ntypes of nonhomogeneity are considered: (i) the elastic modulus varying with the thickness coordinate\nx exponentially, (ii) it varying with the length coordinate y exponentially. The eigenvalues\nfor the two cases are obtained numerically in plane strain and plane stress states, respectively. By\nconsidering the smallest positive eigenvalue, the Saint-Venant Decay rates are estimated, which\nindicates material nonhomogeneity has a significant influence on the Saint-Venant end effect.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Qing Yang  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Bailin Z he ng, Kai Z hang, J ianx in Z hu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "eigenvalue, Saint-Venant decay rate, nonhomogeneous semi-infinite strip", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 27, No. 6, December, 2014", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Jul 2019"}
