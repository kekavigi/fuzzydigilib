{"Nomor": 46108, "Judul": "AN ENDEAVOR IN THE REACTION-BASED APPROACH TO FLUORESCENT PROBES FOR BIORELEVANT ANALYTES: CHALLENGES AND ACHIEVEMENTS", "Abstrak": "The promising features of fluorescence\nspectroscopy have inspired a quest for fluorescent probes for\nanalysis and monitoring of molecular interactions in\nbiochemical, medical, and environmental sciences. To overcome\nthe competitive supramolecular interactions in aqueous\nmedia encountered with conventional molecular-recognitionbased\nprobes, the use of reaction-based probes that involve\nmaking or breaking of covalent bonds has emerged as a\ncomplementary sensing strategy to realize higher selectivity\nand sensitivity with larger spectroscopic changes. In spite of\nthe enormous efforts, the development of reaction-based\nfluorescent probes meets with certain challenges in terms of ...", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Subhankar Singha [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yong Woong Jun, Sourav Sarkar, and Kyo Han Ahn"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Fluorescent Probes, Biorelevant Analytes", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Feb 2020"}
