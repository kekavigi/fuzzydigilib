{"Nomor": 46074, "Judul": "SINGLE ATOM DYNAMICS IN CHEMICAL REACTIONS", "Abstrak": "Many heterogeneous chemical reactions involve gases catalyzed over solid\nsurfaces at elevated temperatures and play a critical role in the production of energy, healthcare,\npollution control, industrial products, and food. These catalytic reactions take place at the atomic\nlevel, with active structures forming under reaction conditions. A fundamental understanding of\ncatalysis at the single atom resolution is therefore a major advance in a rational framework upon\nwhich future catalytic processes can be built. Visualization and analysis of gas-catalyst chemical\nreactions at the atomic level under controlled reaction conditions are key to understanding the\ncatalyst structural evolution and atomic scale reaction mechanisms crucial to the performance and ....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Edward D.
