{"Nomor": 41266, "Judul": "VIBRATION AND SOUND RADIATION OF AN ASYMMETRIC LAMINATED PLATE IN THERMAL ENVIRONMENTS", "Abstrak": "Analytical studies on the vibration and sound radiation characteristics of an asym-\nmetric laminated rectangular plate are carried out in this paper. Theoretical formulations, in\nwhich the effects of thermal environments are taken into account, are derived for the vibration\nand sound radiation based on both first-order shear deformation plate theory and Rayleigh inte-\ngral. It is found that the natural frequencies, the resonant amplitudes of vibration response and\nthe sound pressure level decrease with the temperature rising. The natural frequencies of asym-\nmetric plates are smaller than those of symmetric plates and the velocity responses of asymmetric\nplates are larger than those of symmetric plates.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Weili Yue  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["ming Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "asymmetric laminated plate, thermal environments, FSDPT, vibration, sound ra- diation", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 1, February, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Agu 2019"}
