{"Nomor": 44608, "Judul": "Shore platforms: a neglected coastal feature?", "Abstrak": "This review identifies four themes in shore platform research: 1) the role of marine and\nsubaerial processes in platform development; 2) morphology of shore platforms; 3) modelling\nplatform development; and 4) measuring rates of erosion. The view that shore platforms have a\nwave-cut origin has dominated the literature in the last 20 years. It is argued that this wave-cut\norigin remains to be convincingly demonstrated. Attempts to link platform morphology with the\nprocess environment have proven difficult but a recent demarcation between platform\nmorphologies based on wave erosion and rock resistance offers an interesting and new way to\nconsider platform morphology. Attempts to model platform development have been\nhandicapped by a lack of data and a clear understanding of development processes. All models\nare based on the premise that platforms have a wave-cut origin, yet this has not been adequately\ndemonstrated. There are a number of contradictions between models that require resolution.\nErosion rates have been measured using the micro-erosion meter, but these studies are restricted\nboth temporally and spatially. The contribution of microscale erosion relative to other forms\nand scales remains unknown. A number of issues are raised and suggested as being suitable\nquestions for future research. It is proposed that real advances in understanding shore platforms\nwill be aided by collaborative work between researchers from a number of morphogenetic\nenvironments", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "W.J.
