{"Nomor": 46006, "Judul": "Similarities and Differences between LaNiO2 and CaCuO2 and Implications for Superconductivity", "Abstrak": "The recent observation of superconductivity in hole-doped NdNiO2 has generated considerable\nattention. The similarities and differences between this infinite-layer nickelates and cuprates are still\nan open question. To address this issue we derive, via-principles calculations, essential facts related to the electronic structure and magnetism of RNiO2 (R \u00bc La, Nd) in comparison to their cuprate analog CaCuO2. From this detailed comparison, we find that RNiO2 are promising as cuprate analogs. Besides the much larger d ? p energy splitting, and the presence of R 5d states near the Fermi energy in the parent compound, all other electronic-structure parameters seem to be favorable in the context of superconductivity as inferred from the cuprates. In particular, the large value of the longer-range hopping t0 and the eg energy splitting are similar to those obtained in cuprates. Doping further acts to increase the cupratelike character of these nickelates by suppressing the self-doping effect of the R 5d bands.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "A. S.
