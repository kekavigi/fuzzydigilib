{"Nomor": 44931, "Judul": "End point of nonaxisymmetric black hole instabilities in higher dimensions", "Abstrak": "We report on the end state of nonaxisymmetric instabilities of singly spinning asymptotically flat\nMyers-Perry black holes. Starting from a singly spinning black hole in D \u00bc 5, 6, 7 dimensions, we\nintroduce perturbations with angular dependence described by m \u00bc 2, m \u00bc 3, or m \u00bc 4 azimuthal mode\nnumbers about the axis of rotation. In D \u00bc 5, we find that all singly spinning Myers-Perry black holes are\nstable, in agreement with the results from perturbation theory. In D \u00bc 6 and 7, we find that these black\nholes are nonlinearly stable only for sufficiently low spins. For intermediate spins, although the m \u00bc 2 bar\nmode becomes unstable and leads to large deformations, the black hole settles back down to another\nmember of the Myers-Perry family via gravitational wave emission; surprisingly, we find that all such\nunstable black holes settle to what appear to be the same member of the Myers-Perry family. The amount of energy radiated into gravitational waves can be very large, in some cases more than 30% of the initial total mass of the system. For high enough spins, the m \u00bc 4 mode becomes the dominant unstable mode, leading to deformed black holes that develop local Gregory-Laflamme instabilities, thus forming a naked\nsingularity in finite time, which is further evidence for the violation of the weak cosmic censorship\nconjecture in asymptotically flat higher-dimensional spacetimes.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hans Bantilan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pau Figueras,", "Markus Kunesch,", "and Rodrigo Panosso Macedo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW D 100, 086014 (2019), APS", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Nov 2019"}
