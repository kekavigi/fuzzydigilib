{"Nomor": 40915, "Judul": "Patterns of tree phenological diversity in dry tropics", "Abstrak": "Recent phenological studies in tropical deciduous forests revealed a mosaic of vegetation composed of\nseveral pheno-phases that are evolved as an adaptation by the species to overcome seasonal drought\nin different ways. These pheno-phases represent extent of annual deciduousness (leaflessness) and triggering\nfactors for buds break (e.g. vegetative and flower). Thus, studying patterns of various phenophases\n(phonological diversity) in tropical forest have been thought to provide a potential tool to address\ncritical questions related to climate change modeling and monitoring. In tropics, tree species represent a\ngradient of deciduousness (from leaf-exchanging species to >6 months deciduous species) and flowering\ninitiation (breaking of flower buds in various part of annual cycle). Both processes are mostly triggered by\nvariation in day length and/or temperature during late dry season/autumn, and/or first significant rain\nduring rainy season. In addition, few factors like drought induced leaf fall and sporadic winter rains\nare supposed to affect these processes temporarily. Besides, the abundances of pheno-phases (i.e. leafing\nand flowering) also vary among tropical deciduous forest trees. Presence of such variations in tropical\ntree pheno-phases and their abundances are reported to vary due to micro-climatic variables and has\nspecific implications in tropical forests. Present paper discusses the existing information on various\npheno-phases and their abundances in tropical forests and role of climatic factors on tree phonological\ndiversity. Further, we emphasized the need to develop predicting understanding of impending climatic\nchange (i.e. precipitation and temperature) on diversity of pheno-phases by collecting long-term data\non tree pheno-phases through a network of phonological stations in dry tropics.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "C.P.
