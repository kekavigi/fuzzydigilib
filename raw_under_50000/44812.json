{"Nomor": 44812, "Judul": "The Meshless Galerkin Method For Pressure Distribution Simulation Of Horizontal Well Reservoir", "Abstrak": "This paper provides a novel three-dimensional meshless Galerkin for horizontal well reservoir\nsimulation. The pressure function is approached by moving least-square method which consists of\nweight function, basic function and coefficient. Based on Galerkin principle and use penalty\nfunction method, the paper deduces the meshless Galerkin numerical linear equations. Cut off the\npressure distribution of the horizontal section from the simulation database of horizontal well\nreservoir. It demonstrates that meshless Galerkin is a feasible numerical method for the horizontal\nwell reservoir simulation. It is useful to research complex reservoir", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SHUYONG HU [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Junxiu Ma", "Renyan Zhuo", "Binyuan Qin"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "Three-dimensional, Meshless, Galerkin, Horizontal well, Moving least-square method, Pressure distribution", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 2, Pages 169-171 (September  2015),    http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.07.005", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Nov 2019"}
