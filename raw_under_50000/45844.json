{"Nomor": 45844, "Judul": "Enhanced Fenton-like catalytic performance of Cu-Al/KIT-6 and the key role of O2 in triggering reaction", "Abstrak": "Framework Cu doped Al2O3 dispersed on KIT-6 (Cu-Al/KIT-6) was synthesized by the ultrasonic impregnation\nmethod and characterized by multi-technologies. The catalyst performed superior catalytic performance and\nstability for bisphenol A (BPA) degradation in heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysis. Especially, the effect of O2\nand N2 on BPA degradation was detected over Cu-Al/KIT-6 in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). DMPO\nspin-trap electron spin resonance (ESR) experiments indicated that O2 can be activated to produce reactive\noxygen species (ROS) by Cu(I) on the surface of Cu-Al/KIT-6. Meanwhile, O2 as an electron acceptor can trigger the reaction at the beginning of reaction, which decreased the consumption of H2O2. In addition, BPA and its intermediate products chelate with Cu(II) to form Cu(II)-phenol complex, resulting in a series of reactions to\nfurther promote BPA degradation. These findings provide useful insights into the fundamental theories of Fenton\ncatalysts via interface engineering for practical application.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Huihui Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Lili Zhangb, Chun Hub, Xiangke Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Cu-Al/KIT-6, Dissolved oxygen, Fenton-like, Pollutants degradation, Radicals", "Sumber": "Chemical Engineering Journal journal, www.elsevier.com/locate/cej", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Jan 2020"}
