{"Nomor": 44623, "Judul": "High Sensitivity Very Low Frequency Receiver for Earthquake Data Acquisition", "Abstrak": "A high sensitivity very low frequency (VLF) receiver is developed based on AD744 monolithic\noperational amplifier (Op-Amp) for earthquake data acquisition. In research related natural phenomena\nsuch as atmospheric noise, lightning and earthquake, a VLF receiver particularly with high sensitivity is\nutterly required due to the low power of VLF wave signals received by the antenna. The developed\nreceiver is intended to have high sensitivity reception for the signals in frequency range of 10-30kHz\nallocated for earthquake observation. The VLF receiver which is portably designed is also equipped with\nan output port connectable to the soundcard of personal computer for further data acquisition. After\nobtaining the optimum design, the hardware realization is implemented on a printed circuit board (PCB) for\nexperimental characterization. It shows that the sensitivity of realized VLF receiver is almost linear in the\npredefined frequency range for the input signals lower than -12dBm and to be quadratic for the higher level\ninput signals.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Achmad Munir [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Kusmadi , Kusnandar , Asep Najmurrokhman , Chairunnisa , Sunubroto"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Physics", "Kata Kunci": "data acquisition, earthquake, high sensitivity, VLF receiver", "Sumber": "TELKOMNIKA; Yogyakarta Vol. 15, Iss. 1,  (Mar 2017): 150-155.", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Okt 2019"}
