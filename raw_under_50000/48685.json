There have been many advances in the drug treatment to combat the breast\ncancer \u2013one of them is by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) as they play important roles in\nthe eukaryotic cell cycle progression. There are many kinds of cyclin-dependent kinases, and CDK2\nis one of them. A research showed that the pyrimidine derivatives are potentially able to induce\napoptosis in MDA-MB-468 cells by inhibiting CDK2. The aim of this research was to design new\npyrimidine derivatives as potential anticancer agents based on Quantitative Structure-Activity\nRelationship (QSAR) method. The structure of 24 pyrimidine derivatives were prepared and\noptimized using Gaussian09 to obtain their stable conformations. The physicochemical properties,\nor descriptors, were calculated using Gaussian09 and Molecular Operating Environment 2014.0901.\nThen, the statistical analysis was performed to determine the best QSAR model by using multilinear\nregression on SPSS Statistics 26 and the validation of model was done using Leave One Out method.\nNovel pyrimidine derivatives were designed using Topliss scheme based on valid QSAR equation.\nStructure-based interaction study between pyrimidine derivatives against CDK2 (PDB ID: 1PYE) was\nconducted by molecular docking simulation using AutoDock 4.2 and MGLTools 1.5.6 software. The\nQSAR equation obtained from this study was Log(1/IC50) = ?19.34200 ?35.82030 \u00d7 (HOMO) +\n33.13616 \u00d7 (LUMO) ?0.01592 \u00d7 (ASA_H) + 0.02356 \u00d7 (vol) + 0.06555 \u00d7 (E_vdw) + 12.46394 \u00d7\n(density). Based on this QSAR equation, 6 compounds were predicted to have better IC50 value\ntowards CDK2 than the lead compound. These 6 compounds were docked into CDK2 and the\ndocking result showed that 3 compounds have better free binding energy than the lead compound.\nIn conclusion, compound 25, 26, and 27 were predicted have better anticancer activity than the\nlead compound and it can be a potential novel pyrimidine derivatives as CDK2 inhibitors.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Octaviana Halim": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/208513"}, "Penulis": "Octaviana Halim [10716105]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Daryono Hadi Tjahjono, M.Sc., Apt.", "Dr. Fransiska Kurniawan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sains dan Teknologi Farmasi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Farmasi", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "breast cancer, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), pyrimidine derivatives, anticancer, QSAR, docking", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Jun 2020"}
