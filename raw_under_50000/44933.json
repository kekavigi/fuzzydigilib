{"Nomor": 44933, "Judul": "Confinement effects on the dynamics of a rigid particle in a nanochannel", "Abstrak": "The transport of nanoparticles in confined geometries plays a crucial role in several technological applications ranging from nanopore sensors to filtration membranes. Here we describe a Brownian approach to simulate the motion of a rigid-body nanoparticle of an arbitrary shape under confinement. A quaternion formulation is used for the nanoparticle orientation, and the corresponding overdamped Langevin equation, completed by the proper fluctuation-dissipation relation, is derived. The hydrodynamic mobility matrix is obtained via dissipative particle dynamics simulation equipped with a new method for enforcing the no-slip boundary condition for curved moving solid-liquid interfaces. As an application, we analyzed the motion of a nanoparticle in a cylindrical channel under the action of external fields. We show that both axial effective diffusion and rotational diffusion decrease with confinement.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Alberto Gubbiotti [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mauro Chinappi ,", "and Carlo Massimo Casciola"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW E 100, 053307 (2019), APS", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Nov 2019"}
