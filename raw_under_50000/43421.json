{"Nomor": 43421, "Judul": "The impact of vessel speed reduction on port accidentsYoung", "Abstrak": "tReduced-speed zones (RSZs) have been designated across the world to control emissions from shipsand prevent mammal strikes. While some studies have examined the effectiveness of speed reductionon emissions and mammal preservation, few have analyzed the effects of reduced ship speed on vesselsafety. Those few studies have not yet measured the relationship between vessel speed and accidents byusing real accident data. To fill this gap in the literature, this study estimates the impact of vessel speedreduction on vessel damages, casualties and frequency of vessel accidents. Accidents in RSZ ports werecompared to non-RSZ ports by using U.S. Coast Guard data to capture the speed reduction effects. Theresults show that speed reduction influenced accident frequency as a result of two factors, the fuel priceand the RSZ designation. Every $10 increase in the fuel price led to a 10.3% decrease in the number ofaccidents, and the RSZ designation reduced vessel accidents by 47.9%. However, the results do not clarifythe exact impact of speed reduction on accident casualty.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Young-Tae Chang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hyosoo Park"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Vessel speed reduction, Reduced speed zone,", "Sumber": "Sciencedirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2019"}
