{"Nomor": 44830, "Judul": "Sludge Characterization And Treatment Of Produced Water(PW) Using Tympanotonos Fuscatus Coagulant (TFC)", "Abstrak": "This study investigated coag-flocculation (using TFC) of PW and characterization of the post\ntreatment settled sludge (PTSS). Effects of dosage, pH and settling time on treatment efficiency\nwere evaluated. TFC and PTSS were subjected to Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), Xeray diffraction\n(XRD), Thermogravimetric/Differential scanning calorimetric and Scanning electron microscopic\n(SEM)/Elemental analyses. Optimal treatment efficiency of 91.5% was obtained at 1 g/L and pH 2. It\ncould be concluded that TFC was thermally stable and has potential for application as an effective\nbio-coagulant.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MATTHEW C.
