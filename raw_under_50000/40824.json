{"Nomor": 40824, "Judul": "Can Three-Body Recombination Purify a Quantum Gas?", "Abstrak": "Three-body recombination in quantum gases is traditionally associated with heating, but it was recently\nfound that it can also cool the gas. We show that in a partially condensed three-dimensional homogeneous\nBose gas three-body loss could even purify the sample, that is, reduce the entropy per particle and increase the condensed fraction ?.We predict that the evolution of ? under continuous three-body loss can, depending on small changes in the initial conditions, exhibit two qualitatively different behaviors\u2014if it is initially above a certain critical value, ? increases further, whereas clouds with lower initial ? evolve towards a thermal gas.These dynamical effects should be observable under realistic experimental conditions.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lena H.
