In this study, cut roses (Rosa\nhybrida) were treated with 8-hydroxyquinoline (100 mg L?1, 200 mg L?1 and 300 mg L?1) and benzalkonium\nchloride (25 mg L?1, 50mg L?1 and 100 mg L?1). An analysis of microbial concentrations showed that a high\nconcentration of 8-hydroxyquinoline (300 mg L?1) could effectively control and kill fungi but had less effect\nor influence on bacterial reproduction,whereas benzalkonium chloride functions well in reducing the reproduction of both fungi and bacteria. Correlation analysis between the number of bacterial colony-forming units (CFUs) andwater uptake revealed a significantly negative correlation between the log10 number of bacterial colonies and water uptake. When there were approximately 2.84 \u00d7 105 and 2.15 \u00d7 105 bacterial CFU mL?1 in the vase liquid, the water uptake of cut roses cv. Movie star and cv. Black lace decreased dramatically. It was observed that cut roses with higherwater uptake had a better vase-holding quality after been treatedwith benzalkoniumchloride (50 mg L?1, 100 mg L?1). Benzalkonium chloride (50 mg L?1, 100 mg L?1) was also found to be effective in extending the longevity for an additional 2\u20133 days, increasing water uptake, enlarging corolla diameter as well as extending blooming time.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Long Li  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yongjin Qiao, Tingwen Lv, Li Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Benzalkonium chloride, 8-hydroxyquinoline, Number of bacteria, Water uptake, Vase-holding quality", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Jul 2019"}
