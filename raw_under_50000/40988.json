By combination of the statistical data and visualization mapping, we studied on the research relationship networks and status for the co-authors' institutions, coauthors, co-citation literatures and co-occurring keywords of ecological assets/values based on the sample data fromliteratures. In the aspects of research on ecological values, our results showed that: (i)main countries of researches on ecological valueswere the United States, Australia, Canada and China in order, especially the US had the most plenty of literatures in relation to ecological values, and at the same time, literatures fromChina in this field are in the upper level; (ii) the hotspots of researches on ecological values fromthe global literatures covered various fields including biodiversity, species richness, ecosystemservices, landscape, climate change and dynamic\nsimulation; (iii) as a result of the multidisciplinary integration, the hotspots of researches on ecological values\nemerge endlessly, so that many high yielding authors and relevant international institutions constantly expanded\nthe research scopes and fields, which promoted the combination of theories and made the significant contribution\nto themselves; (iv) the mass domestic researches on ecological values began in 1992. The number of\nposting paper increased obviously and the scopes in relation to ecological value expanded gradually, particularly\ninvolved with ecology, economy, even legal and ideology, which illustrated that concepts of \u201cecological values\u201d\nhad not been only confined to the researches on the traditional science, but also beenwidely used inmany fields\nof humanity and social science.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zhuo Lin [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["ChengzhenWu, Wei Hong"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "CiteSpace,Ecological assets, Ecological values, Knowledge mapping", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Jul 2019"}
