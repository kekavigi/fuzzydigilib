{"Nomor": 48985, "Judul": "A SIMPLE INFILL WELL LOCATION SELECTION USING MACHINE LEARNING: A MULTILAYER INDONESIAN RESERVOIR CASE", "Abstrak": "In this paper, machine learning is used to help the user selecting infill well-drilling location with much easier,\nsaving time, and effective way compared to what the industry has done with conventional simulators. A Voronoi\ndiagram is involved in the process and the workflow is summarized in a procedure. The procedure is very useful\nfor a field with a lack of data and all types of the reservoir, and in this case, a multi-layer Indonesian reservoir\ntype in Field X is chosen as a sample.\nMachine learning, part of Artificial Intelligence, has been used in oil and gas industries to maximize their\nproductivity with less effort. As time goes by, several machine learning techniques has been used in many different\noil and gas industry sectors. One of the advantages of using machine learning in reservoir engineering applications\nis they do not require specific physical models but can provide good estimations if there is enough data provided.\nThat is why this study can be useful for all types of the reservoir, in other words, in a reservoir of which exact\nhydrocarbon production mechanisms are not clearly understood and lack of data.\nField X is one of the Indonesian oil fields which reservoirs have unique characteristics, known by having many\npartial layers in each well. A conventional 3-D earth simulator is needed to calculate the current oil in place per\nwell to choose the new infill well candidates\u2019 location. Nevertheless, the problems are, not every field has its most\nupdated 3-d and many reservoir properties are needed to do the simulations. The method of this study helps to\nchoose the new infill well candidates\u2019 locations by just using machine learning and the Voronoi diagram. It doesn\u2019t\nneed many physical data as the conventional 3-D earth simulator need and saves time. All the workflows are\npackaged in a procedure, with hope for implementation on the industrial scale.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Saif Izeldien Raizki": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/209125"}, "Penulis": "Saif Izeldien Raizki [12216080]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Dedy Irawan, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Machine learning, Infill well, Voronoi diagram, Reservoir engineering.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Agu 2020"}
