{"Nomor": 40906, "Judul": "Comparison of physiological characteristics of Kandelia obovata at different ages in winter in the northernmost mangrove transplanted area of China", "Abstrak": "This study took place on Ximen Island within Ximen Island Marine Special Reserve, Yueqing County, Zhejiang\nProvince, at the northernmost boundary of artificially planted mangrove plantations, to study\nchanges in the physiological characteristics of different aged Kandelia obovata trees (aged 1, 2, 4, 8 and\n53 years). Leaves and stems of different aged K. obovata were sampled in November and December (mean\nair temperature was 15.8 C and 7.6 C, respectively) for measurements of physiological traits. Results\nshowed that from November to December, content of both chlorophyll and carotenoids, the chlorophyll\na/b ratio and activity of peroxidase (POD) in leaves, the content of total soluble sugars, free amino acids,\nand content of K+ in the leaves and stems first increased and then decreased with increasing age. Also, Na+ content in the leaves and stems, as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) content in leaves decreased. Importantly, the measured differences in these chemicals in trees of different ages were more significant in\nDecember. We conclude that older individuals of the mangrove K. obovata were able to survive by maintaining higher levels of photosynthetic pigments and activities of antioxidant enzymes, and were able to\neffectively regulate ion stabilization, which promoted carbon and nitrogen metabolism. Also, disorders\nrelated to the ion balance and carbon and nitrogen metabolism may not allow K. obovata seedlings to\nadapt to low temperature stress. Our findings indicate that attempts to provide safe overwintering of\nK. obovata seedling may face significant challenges.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Chunfang Zheng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Weicheng Liu, Jianbiao Qiu, Li Huang, Xiaolin Huang, Shaobo Chen"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "High-latitude, Ion balance, Kandelia, candel Mangrove, Physiological characteristics", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Jul 2019"}
