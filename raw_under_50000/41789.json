The seeds of perilla\nare small end globular weight about 4 g/1000, contained approximately 35\u201345% oil. However the leaves are a very poor source of oil, since they contain only 0.2%. In addition, only the seed oil contains the omega 3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). In comparing to other plant oils, perilla seed oil consistently contains the one of the highest proportion of omega-3 (ALA) fatty acids, at 54\u201364%. The omega-6 (linoleic acid) component is usually around 14% and omega-9 (Oleic acid) is also present in perilla oil. These polyunsaturated fatty acids are most beneficial to human health and in prevention of different diseases like cardiovascular disorders, cancer, inflammatory, rheumatoid arthritis etc.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mohammad Asif [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Pharmacology & therapeutics", "Kata Kunci": "Perilla frutescencs, Polyunsaturated fatty acids, Alpha-linolenic acid,  Cardiovascular,  Inflammatory,  Rheumatoid arthritis", "Sumber": "Oriental Pharmacy and Experimental Medicine ISSN: 1598-2386 (Print) 2211-1069 (Online)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Sep 2019"}
