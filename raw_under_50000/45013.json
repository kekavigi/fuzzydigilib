{"Nomor": 45013, "Judul": "Velocity Profiles Description And Shape Factors Inclusion In A Hyperbolic, One-Dimensional, Transient Two-Fluid Model For Stratified And Slug Flow Simulations In Pipes", "Abstrak": "In a previous work it has been shown that a one-dimensional, hyperbolic, transient five equations twofluid model is able to numerically describe stratified, wavy, and slug flow in horizontal and nearhorizontal pipes. Slug statistical characteristics can be numerically predicted with results in good\nagreement with experimental data and well-known empirical relations. In this model some approximated and simplified assumptions are adopted to describe shear stresses at wall and at phase interface.\nIn this paper, we focus on the possibility to account for the cross sectional flow by inserting shape\nfactors into the momentum balance equations of the aforementioned model. Velocity profiles are obtained by a pre-integrated model and they are computed at each time step and at each computational\ncell. Once that the velocity profiles are known, the obtained shape factors are inserted in the numerical\nresolution. In this way it is possible to recover part of the information lost due to the one-dimensional\nflow description.\nVelocity profiles computed in stratified conditions are compared against experimental profiles\nmeasured by PIV technique; a method to compute the velocity profile during slug initiation and growth\nhas been developed and the computed velocity distribution in the liquid phase was compared against the\none-seventh power law.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ARIANNA BONZANINI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Davide Picchi", "Marco Ferrari", "Pietro Poesio"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "Multi-phase pipeline transport, Oil & gas, Hyperbolic two-fluid model, Velocity profiles, Shape factors", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 5, Issue 2, Pages 191-198 (June  2019), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.03.005", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Nov 2019"}
