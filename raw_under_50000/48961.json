{"Nomor": 48961, "Judul": "TECHNO-ECONOMIC EVALUATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOW RESISTIVITY AND LOW CONTRAST RESERVOIR WITH HYDRAULICALLY FRACTURED WELL AND WATER INJECTION", "Abstrak": "X field is an example of a low resistivity and low contrast (LRLC) reservoir found in South Sumatra, with initial\noil content in the one pattern of reservoir estimated at 3.48 MMSTB. This field has reserves that can be produced\nup to 30% but it has relatively low permeability value. The processes that can be used to stimulate the wells in\nlow permeability reservoir are hydraulic fracturing and water injection.\nThis study aims to analyze the application of hydraulic fracturing and water injection in the X field and review its\nfeasibility using simple economic analysis. By using the results of the model initialization, reservoir simulation\nusing the CMG Builder program is carried out through six base cases representing the wide heterogeneity of\nreservoir. From this simulation, the original oil in place, recovery factor, cumulative production, and production\nrate values are obtained for each base case. At this stage, the six base cases are given field development in the\nform of hydraulic fracturing and water injection. Each base case has seventeen development cases. From this\nsimulation, the recovery factor, cumulative production, and production rate values are obtained for each\ndevelopment case.\nFrom the result of economic analysis shows that the most appropriate development method for the LRLC zone on\nthe X field is hydraulic fracturing. The application of water injection to hydraulic fractured wells in the LRLC\nzone only provides increased production but does not provide greater economic benefits.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Vinsensius Kevin Wibowo": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/209085"}, "Penulis": "Vinsensius Kevin Wibowo [12216051]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ardhi Hakim Lumban Gaol, S.T., M.T.,"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Generalities", "Kata Kunci": "horizontal permeability, LRLC zone, hydraulic fracturing, water injection, economic analysis.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Agu 2020"}
