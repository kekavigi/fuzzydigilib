{"Nomor": 44661, "Judul": "Electrical Components of Maglev Systems: Emerging Trends", "Abstrak": "Consistently rising environmental concerns and\ndepleting petroleum resources have accentuated the need of\nsustainable, energy efficient and clean means of transport.\nThis has provided the impetus to the research and development of clean alternatives for existing public transportation systems. Development of linear motor-propelled,\ncontact-less maglev systems is considered a promising\nalternative to conventional on-wheel rail transport technology. Maglev technology primarily focuses on improving the performance, speed, fuel economy, driving range\nand operating cost of the transit system. These parameters\nvary with the design and efficiency of the electrical system\nused in maglev-based transportation systems. To present\nthis study, firstly, a detailed survey of the important constituents of a maglev electrical system has been carried out\nwith techno-economic perspectives. Contemporary maglev\ntechnologies have then explored along with their respective\nadvantages and limitations. Electrical systems form the\nheart of maglev systems and, therefore, this paper presents\nthe components of a standard electrical system together\nwith the comparative analysis in terms of present trends,\non-going technological advancements and future\nchallenges.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Nisha Prasad1  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Shailendra Jain1 \u2022 Sushma Gupta"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering of railroads & roads", "Kata Kunci": "On-wheel rail  Maglev  Propulsion  Linear motors  Guidance  Levitation", "Sumber": "Urban Rail Transit (2019) 5(2):67\u201379", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos \u00a0\n                                     Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Okt 2019"}
