{"Nomor": 44821, "Judul": "A New Approach Of Proration-Injection Allocation For Water-Flooding Mature Oilfields", "Abstrak": "This paper presents a new method of injection-production allocation estimation for water-flooding\nmature oilfields. The suggested approach is based on logistic growth rate functions and several\ntype-curve matching methods. Using the relationship between these equations, oil production and\nwater injection rate as well as injection-production ratio can be easily forecasted. The calculation\nprocedure developed and outlined in this paper requires very few production data and is easily\nimplemented. Furthermore, an oilfield case has been analyzed. The synthetic and field cases validate the calculation procedure, so it can be accurately used in forecasting production data, and it is\nimportant to optimize the whole injection-production system.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SHUYONG HU [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yongkai Li", "Ziwei Wang", "Guoqiang Hu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "Logistic growth models, Injection-production allocation, Oil production, Water injection rate, Injection-production ratio", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 1, Pages 27-30 (March  2015),    http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.03.009", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Nov 2019"}
