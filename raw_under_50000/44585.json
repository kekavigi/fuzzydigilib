{"Nomor": 44585, "Judul": "Local Biologies and HIV/AIDS in Highlands Papua, Indonesia", "Abstrak": "The province of Papua, Indonesia has one of the fastest growing rates of\nHIV infection in Asia. Within volatile political conditions, HIV has reached generalized epidemic status for indigenous Papuans. This article explores the merits of\nusing the concept of local biologies as an analytic tool to assess the range of factors\nwhich affect a local pattern of untreated HIV and rapid onset of AIDS. A research\nteam conducted 32 in-depth interviews with HIV-positive indigenous persons and\n15 interviews with health care workers in urban and peri-urban sites in the central\nhighlands region. The results show fear of gossip and stigmatization, regional\npolitical conditions and gaps in care interweave to create local biological conditions\nof evasion of care and rapid onset of AIDS. The normative emphasis in contemporary scholarship on stigma as shaping subjective responses to HIV needs to be\ncomplemented by a full assessment of the physiological impact of health services,\nand the ways political conditions trickle down and mediate local biological patterns.\nThe concept of local biologies is highly effective for explaining the full scope of\npossible factors affecting the intersection of social and physical realms for HIVpositive persons.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Leslie Butt [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Life sciences ; biology", "Kata Kunci": "Local biologies  HIV/AIDS  Health care  Discrimination Subjectivities", "Sumber": "Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry; New York Vol. 37, Iss. 1,  (Mar 2013): 179-94.
