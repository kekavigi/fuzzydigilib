{"Nomor": 46143, "Judul": "KETOCONAZOLE?P?AMINOBENZOIC ACID COCRYSTAL: REVIVAL OF AN OLD DRUG BY CRYSTAL ENGINEERING", "Abstrak": "The 1:1 cocrystal of the antifungal agent ketoconazole with p-aminobenzoic acid was successfully crystallized and systematically characterized by a physical and pharmacological point of view. Crystal structure determination confirmed the cocrystal identity, giving full insight in its crystal packing and degree of disorder. Powder dissolution measurements revealed a 10-fold aqueous solubility increase that induces a 6.7-fold oral bioavailability improvement compared to ketoconazole. In vitro cell assays showed a good toxicity profile of the cocrystal with lower oxidative stress and inflammation and enhanced antifungal activity against several Candida species. The in vivo study of the cocrystal indicated similar pharmacokinetic profiles and liver toxicity with increased transaminases, as reported for ketoconazole. Notably, besides minor signs of inflammation, no morphological changes in liver parenchyma or signs of fibrosis and necrosis were detected. The enhanced solubility and oral bioavailability of the cocrystal over ketoconazole, together with the improved antifungal activity and good in vitro/in vivo toxicity, indicate its potential use as an alternative antifungal agent to the parent drug. Our results bring evidence of cocrystallization as a successful approach for bioavailability improvement of poorly soluble drugs.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Flavia Martin [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mihaela Pop, Irina Kacso, Ioana Georgeta Grosu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "ketoconazole, p-aminobenzoic acid, cocrystal, solubility, physical stability, bioavailability, biological assay", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Feb 2020"}
