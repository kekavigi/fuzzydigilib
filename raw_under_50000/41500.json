{"Nomor": 41500, "Judul": "Evaluation of earthquake parameters used in the Indonesian Tsunami Early Warning System", "Abstrak": "Twenty-two of a total of 30 earthquake events reported by the Indonesian Agency for Geophysics, Climatology and Meteorology during the time period 2007\u20132010 were falsely issued as tsunamigenic by the Indonesian Tsunami Early Warning System (Ina-TEWS). These 30 earthquakes were of different magnitudes and occurred in different locations. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the Ina-TEWS using common earthquake parameters, including the earthquake magnitude, origin time, depth, and epicenter. In total, 298 datasets assessed by the Ina-TEWS and the global centroid moment tensor (CMT) method were assessed. The global CMT method is considered by almost all seismologists to be a reference for the determination of these parameters as they have been proved to be accurate. It was found that the earthquake magnitude, origin time, and depth provided by the Ina-TEWS were significantly different from those given in the global CMT catalog, whereas the latitude and longitude positions of the events provided by both tsunami assessment systems were coincident. The performance of the Ina-TEWS, particularly in terms of accuracy, remains questionable and needs to be improved.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Madlazim [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Tjipto Prastowo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Earth sciences", "Kata Kunci": "Ina-TEWS,  GLOBAL centroid moment tensor catalog,  Performance,  Accuracy,  Earthquake, parameters", "Sumber": "Earthquake Science  February 2016, Volume 29, Issue 1, pp 27\u201333", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Agu 2019"}
