This study examined antioxidantmetabolism variation associated with salt stress tolerance of six maize cultivars (Luyu39, Huanong138, Xianyu335, Aoyu3007, Yayu8, Jinping618) under growth chamber environments. The seedlings of six cultivarswere subjected to seven NaCl concentrations ranging from 0 to 295 mM for 20 days. The salt stress tolerance of the six cultivars varied largely, with their salt tolerance threshold values ranging from 184.5 to 303.4 mM. Luyu39 had the highest threshold value and was considered as salt tolerant cultivar, and Jinping618 had the lowest threshold (184.5mM) andwas considered as salt sensitive cultivar. Luyu39 had lowerMDA content, higher antioxidant enzyme (SOD, CAT, and POD) activity, and lower proline content when compared to Jinping618 at 245 mM and 295 mM NaCl levels. The results suggest that MDA, antioxidant enzyme activity, and proline content can be used as metabolic markers to evaluate relative salt tolerance of different maize cultivars under severe salt stress (245 mM or higher concentration NaCl) conditions.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yongliang Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Danli Jia, Junling Guo,  Xunzhong Zhang, Caixia Guo, Zhiping Yang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Antioxidant, Cultivar, Maize, Salt tolerance, Superoxide dismutase", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Jul 2019"}
