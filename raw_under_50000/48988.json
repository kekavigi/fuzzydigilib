{"Nomor": 48988, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTION PERFORMANCE METHOD OF MICROBIAL HUFF AND PUFF", "Abstrak": "Based on the factors related with Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery (MEOR), microbial growth is one of the most\ncritical factor that determines the population of microbes, their metabolism and metabolic by-products which may\nlead to physical alteration in the reservoir, increase oil production, and even reserves. Therefore, microbial growth\nmodelling is necessary in order to forecast the performance of MEOR-implemented well. The objective of this\nstudy is to determine the most representative microbial growth model for the microbe used in Field X by fitting\nexisting empirical models (Logistic, Gompertz, and Richards) by using grofit package in R program and analyzing\nthe R-squared (R2) and Residual Sum of Squared (RSS) values. Hence, forecasting future production performance\ncould be performed by employing Darcy equation. Related parameters such as viscosity and skin need to be\nadjusted since MEOR contributes to oil viscosity reduction and wellbore clean-up. In order to gain the accurate\nprediction, oil viscosity reduction model over time is constructed using laboratory data.\nFrom the microbial population monitoring in Field X (TM-122 and TM-125 well), Gompertz model is considered\nto describe microbial growth in reservoir. MEOR treatment resulted the reduction of oil viscosity for about 23%\nand 15% which supported by laboratory data of TM-125 and TM-122. By adjusting some parameters, Darcy\nequation is suitable to forecast future production performance of MEOR-implemented well with error less than\n5%. From this study, the primary mechanisms of MEOR in Field X are viscosity reduction, near wellbore damage\nremoval, and IFT reduction.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Wiranty Prayoga Ningmandira": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/209131"}, "Penulis": "Wiranty Prayoga Ningmandira [12216092]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
