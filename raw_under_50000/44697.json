{"Nomor": 44697, "Judul": "Development of a Behavior-Based Passenger Flow Assignment Model for Urban Rail Transit in Section Interruption Circumstance", "Abstrak": "At present, the urban rail transit (URT) system\nhas achieved network operation in many major cities of\nChina. But, little attention has been given to the vulnerability of the URT system. The purpose of this study is\nto assign the passenger flow under the condition of section\ninterruption in URT system. Two surveys (a passenger\nbehavior survey and a stated preference survey) were\nconducted and a multinomial logit model was developed.\nThe results show that although the first choice of passengers in emergency situation is to stay in URT system by a\ncircuitous way, more than half of the respondents express\ninterest in the temporary shuttle bus. For the temporary\nshuttle bus, the sensitivity analysis show that the relative\nspeed is more important than crowding degree for passengers. The significant variables mostly fall in the personal attributes such as income, gender, age, etc. The\nimpacts of trip feature factors are similar to the previous\nresearch in normal situations. These results provide basic\nsupport for passenger flow assignment at the shuttle bus\nlevel and reducing the risk of crowding at some special\nstations. Moreover, it is also good for reducing passenger\ndelay and recovering the trip.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jing Teng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wang-Rui Liu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering of railroads & roads", "Kata Kunci": "Urban rail transit  Section interruption Passenger flow assignment  SP survey  Multinomial logit mod", "Sumber": "Urban Rail Transit (2015) 1(1):35\u201346", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Okt 2019"}
