{"Nomor": 45840, "Judul": "Highly selective separation of Re(VII) from Mo(VI) by using biomaterialbased ionic gel adsorbents: Extractive adsorption enrichment of Re and surface blocking of Mo", "Abstrak": "It is urgently needed to develop highly efficient and selective adsorbents for enrichment and separation of Re\n(VII) from Mo(VI) to obtain metallic rhenium. By tuning cross-link of chitosan, ionic gel capsules (CSN) were\nprepared, which had a core-shell structure and wrapped N263 (methyl trioctyl ammonium chloride) as an extractant. After being characterized, the CSN capsules were used as a green adsorbent for separation .....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Wenjing Li [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xuelin Dongb, Lihua Zhu, Heqing Tang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Ionic gel, Chitosan, Quaternary ammonium, Rhenium, Molybdenum, Extractive adsorption", "Sumber": "Chemical Engineering Journal journal, www.elsevier.com/locate/cej", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Jan 2020"}
