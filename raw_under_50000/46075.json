{"Nomor": 46075, "Judul": "A DECADE OF ELECTROCHEMICAL DEHYDROGENATIVE C,C-COUPLING OF ARYLS", "Abstrak": "The importance of sustainable and green synthetic protocols for the\nsynthesis of fine chemicals has rapidly increased during the last decades in an effort to\nreduce the use of fossil fuels and other finite resources. The replacement of common\nreagents by electricity provides a cost- and atom-efficient, environmentally friendly, and\ninherently safe access to novel synthetic routes. The selective formation of carbon?\ncarbon bonds between two distinct substrates is a crucial tool in organic chemistry. This\nfundamental transformation enables access to a broad variety of complex molecular\narchitectures. In particular, the aryl?aryl bond formation has high significance for the\npreparation of organic materials, drugs, and natural products. Besides well-known and\nwell-established reductive- and oxidative-reagent-mediated or transition-metal-catalyzed\ncoupling reactions, novel synthetic protocols have arisen, which require fewer steps than\nconventional synthetic approaches.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Johannes L.
