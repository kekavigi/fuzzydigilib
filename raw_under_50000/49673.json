Knowing the\ninitial condition of the cable when it will install or knowing periodically the\ncondition of the cable that has operated from the threat of external interference is\nessential because, in this phase, failure usually occurs. Various electrical test\nmethods have developed to diagnose cable conditions that can divide into two\nessential categories, namely in the ability to identify defects such as globally or in\nbulk and spatially or locally. Locating and detecting degraded portions of defect\nbecomes very important because it is related to the next preventive step that must\ntake considering that replacing cables throughout the section is an incorrect choice\nboth in terms of cost and time.\nThe problem that often occurs in the field is the occurrence of soft defects that often\noccur when installing cables due to various factors such as being pinched,\npunctured, or peeled. Over last year, many methods based on non-destructive tests\nsuch as Line Resonance Analysis (LIRA), Broadband Impedance Spectroscopy\n(BIS). Time Domain Reflectometry, Joint time-frequency domain Reflectometry is\ncarried out. Apart from the non-destructive method, it also does not require a\nsource or higher test voltage approaching Uo but only a low voltage \u00b1 5 Vpp, so it\nis very flexible to do in the field. The BIS method is still being developed and\nresearched because there are still many challenges in processing and the ability to\ninterpret test result data.\nThe approach used is to conduct experimental laboratory experiments and\nsimulations with ANSYS Electronic Desktop software. An RG 58 CU cable of 33.5\nmeters used in the experiment, divided into four sections, 3 meters of which were\nprobes to DUT, 15 meters of the whole section, 0.5 meters of degraded portion, and\n15 meters at the end was regular cable. Each section is connected using an\nindividual BNC connector for RG 58 CU cables. The degraded portion is done by\nusing several types. The first is to use mechanical damage by bending beyond the \ncable's tolerance limit until there is a change in the geometry of the cable. The\nsecond is by connecting the resistance (100 Ohm) or capacitance (10 nF) value\nusing the T joint connector, adding capacitance or resistance values will change\nthe impedance value at that point so that the change in impedance value interpreted\nas a degraded portion.\nThe simulation was done by using three models, namely normal conditions with a\nlength of 33.5 meters, a model with a mechanical damage section, and a model with\na peeled off 90-degree damage section. The next approach is to compare test results\nwith simulations designed with the same parameters as the experimental setup.\nFrom the test results compared with the simulation results, it found that the type of\ndefect caused by the mechanical press and the peeled parts have different\ncharacteristics where the mechanical press will have a smaller impedance value\nwith increasing frequency. In contrast, the peeled part has the opposite\ncharacteristic. Besides, the IT transform method and IFFT method both of them can\ndetect precisely the degraded portion at 18.5 meters from 33.5 meters total length\nof the cable under test. IT transform is easier to use but has to have a frequency\nrange that matches the velocity factor of the cable being tested besides the initial\nor healthy conditions of the cable must be known as a comparison factor. If using\nthe IFFT method, the constraints found are noise interference so that the correct\nwindowing and signal processing is needed and also to get a smaller resolution, a\nhigher frequency range is needed.", "Daftar File": {"Cover": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/211674", "Abstrak dan Abstract": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/211675", "Lembar Pengesahan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/211676", "Tesis": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/211677"}, "Penulis": "Agung Siswoyo [23218019]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
