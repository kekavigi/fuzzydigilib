{"Nomor": 46119, "Judul": "COLLAGEN STRUCTURE-FUNCTION RELATIONSHIPS FROM SOLID-STATE NMR SPECTROSCOPY", "Abstrak": "The extracellular matrix of a tissue is as\nimportant to life as the cells within it. Its detailed molecular\nstructure defines the environment of a tissue\u2019s cells and thus\ntheir properties, including differentiation and metabolic status.\nCollagen proteins are the major component of extracellular\nmatrices. Self-assembled collagen fibrils provide both specific\nmechanical properties to handle external stresses on tissues\nand, at the molecular level, well-defined protein binding sites to\ninteract with cells. How the cell?matrix interactions are\nmaintained against the stresses on the tissue is an important\nand as yet unanswered question. Similarly, how collagen\nmolecular and fibrillar structures change in aging and disease is\na crucial open question.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ieva Goldberga [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Rui Li, Melinda J.
