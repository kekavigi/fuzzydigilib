{"Nomor": 45260, "Judul": "Assessment Of Hydrocarbon Generation Potential And Thermal Maturity Of The Ofshore Mannar Basin, Sri Lanka", "Abstrak": "The Mannar Basin is an under-explored ofshore sedimentary basin in terms of petroleum geology. The Cretaceous to Paleogene cutting samples were collected in three ofshore exploration wells (i.e. the Dorado North, Dorado and Barracuda) in the\nMannar Basin. In this study, kerogen type, quantity and thermal maturity of sedimentary organic matter were ascertained\nusing Rock\u2013Eval pyrolysis and vitrinite refectance analyses. In addition, 1-D basin modelling was used to analyse the timing of hydrocarbon generation in the Mannar Basin. Total organic carbon (TOC) contents and total hydrocarbon potential\nare higher in the Cretaceous calcareous mudstones than in the Paleogene calcareous silty/sandy mudstones. TOC contents\nshow a negative correlation with oxygen index. Hydrogen index and oxygen index values range from 77 to 785 mg HC/g\nTOC and from 25 to 165 mg HC/g TOC, respectively. Organic matters were identifed as mixed Type II\u2013III and Type III\nkerogen. Maturity expressed in term of Tmax and vitrinite refectance range from 332 to 456 \u00b0C and from 0.26 to 1.49%,\nrespectively. It indicates both immature and mature sediments. In general, maturity values are relatively high in the Late\nCretaceous sediments (Tmax, from 332 to 456 \u00b0C, average = 423 \u00b0C \u00b1 25) compared to the Paleogene sediments (Tmax,\nfrom 388 to 431 \u00b0C, average 419 \u00b0C \u00b1 10). Geochemical proxies show that oil and gas prone (Type II\u2013III) and gas prone\n(Type III) kerogen-rich Late Cretaceous sediments of the Dorado and Barracuda wells have principally achieved maturity\nlevels for oil window. Therefore, it suggests incomplete thermal conversion for the wet gas generation in the northeast part\nof the Mannar Basin. In the 1-D basin modelling, the maximum hydrocarbon generation was observed during the Neogene\nPeriod in the Late Cretaceous sediments of the deeper Barracuda well.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "AMILA SANDARUWAN RATNAYAKE [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Chaminda Wimal Kularathne", "Yoshikazu Sampei"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Rock\u2013Eval pyrolysis, Vitrinite reflectance, Kerogen type, 1-D kinetic modelling, Petroleum geochemistr", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Exploration and Production Technology, Volume 8, Issue 3, 641-654-1224 (September 2018), https://doi.org/10.1007/s13202-018-0408-1", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Des 2019"}
