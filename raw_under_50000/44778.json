{"Nomor": 44778, "Judul": "Determination Of Oil Well Production Performance Using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Linked To The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Tool", "Abstrak": "Greater complexity is involved in the transient pressure analysis of horizontal oil wells in contrast\nto vertical wells, as the horizontal wells are considered entirely horizontal and parallel with the top\nand underneath boundaries of the oil reserve. Therefore, there is an essential need to estimate\nproductivity of horizontal wells accurately to examine the effectiveness of a horizontal well in\nterms of technical and economic prospects.\nIn this work, novel and rigorous methods based on two different types of intelligent approaches\nincluding the artificial neural network (ANN) linked to the particle swarm optimization (PSO) tool\nare developed to precisely forecast the productivity of horizontal wells under pseudo-steady-state\nconditions. It was found that there is very good match between the modeling output and the real\ndata taken from the literature, so that a very low average absolute error percentage is attained (e.g.,\n<0.82%). The developed techniques can be also incorporated in the numerical reservoir simulation\npackages for the purpose of accuracy improvement as well as better parametric sensitivity analysis", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MOHAMMAD ALI AHMADI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Reza Soleimani", "Moonyong Lee", "Tomoaki Kashiwao", "Alireza Bahadori"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Well productivity, Drainage area, Skin factor, Least square, Support vector machine, Hybrid connectionist model, Particle swarm optimization", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 2, Pages 118-132 (September  2015),  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.06.004", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "05 Nov 2019"}
