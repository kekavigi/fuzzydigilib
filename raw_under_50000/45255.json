The phenomenon serves vital role\nin many facets of hydrocarbon production, especially\nassociated with reservoir management such as interpretation of temperature logs of production and injection well,\nidentification of water and gas entry locations in multilayer\nproduction scenarios, modelling of thermal response of\nhydrocarbon reservoirs and prediction of wellbore flowing\ntemperature profile. The purpose of this study is to develop\na new method for the evaluation of JT coefficient, as an\nessential parameter required to account the Joule\u2013Thomson\neffects while predicting the flowing temperature profile for\ngas production wells. To do this, a new correction factor,\nCNM, has been developed through numerical analysis and\nproposed a practical method to predict CNM which can\nsimplify the prediction of flowing temperature for gas\nproduction wells while accounting the Joule\u2013Thomson\neffect. The developed correlation and methodology were\nvalidated through an exhaustive survey which has been\nconducted with 20 different gas mixture samples. For each\nsample, the model has been run for a wide range of temperature and pressure conditions, and the model was rigorously verified by comparison of the results estimated\nthroughout the study with the results obtained from\nHYSYS and Peng\u2013Robinson equation of state. It is observed that model is very simple and robust yet can\naccurately predict the Joule\u2013Thomson effect", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "N. TAROM [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Md.
