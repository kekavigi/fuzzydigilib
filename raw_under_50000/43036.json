{"Nomor": 43036, "Judul": "0.75 V 2.6 GHz digital bang\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdbang PLL with dynamic double-tail phase detector and supply-noise-tolerant gm-controlled DCO", "Abstrak": "A compact low-supply-voltage yet low-noise digital bang\u2013bang PLL\n(DBBPLL) is proposed. The bang\u2013bang phase detector is based on a\ndynamic double-tail latch which enables high time-to-voltage gain\nand low input-referred noise under tight power-supply headroom.\nThe ring-based digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) is made of multiple\ngm-controlled delay units and a constant-gm-biased current\nDAC. By combining these two blocks, the DCO can now better tolerate\nsupply noise and process variations. A prototype DBBPLL has been\nimplemented in a mainstream 28 nm CMOS process with a compact\ndie area of 0.014 mm2. When operating at 2.6 GHz, it consumes\n2.9 mW with 0.75 V supply and achieves low in-band phase noise of\n?105 dBc/Hz.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "C.-H.
