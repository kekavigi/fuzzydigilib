This study\nproposed four steps for applying an integrated structure stability index, which was derived to characterize\nboth the diversity and equilibrium of eco-industrial chain, to structure stability analysis, and searching\na final eco-industrial chain with the highest structure stability as follows: (1) analyzing links and link\npoints of existing and planned industries through material and energy flow analysis; (2) identifying supplementary\nindustries, which are integrated with pillar industries to enhance structure stability, through\nforward diffusion effect, backward diffusion effect and sideward diffusion effect analysis of pillar industries;\n(3) testing industrial structure stability by introducing an integrated structure stability index;\n(4) coupling of all definitized links and link points.\nThese four steps were applied to a case study of Lianyungang Xuwei New Area, China. The results\nshowed that: (1) there were 9 link points and 17 links of the planned five pillar industries in this area;\n(2) cement, building materials, chemical fertilizer, fine chemicals and marine chemicals with newly added\n23 link points and 44 links should be considered as the supplementary industries; (3) the improvement\nin structure stability was confirmed by the integrated structure stability index increasing from 0.116 to\n0.158 after adding supplementary industries; and (4) the final \u201csteel\u2013petrochemical-equipment\nmanufacturing-logistics-IGCC polygeneration\u201d eco-industrial chain was constructed by coupling 32 link\npoints and 61 links. Therefore, by taking pillar industries as the kernel and by introducing an integrated\nstructure stability index for the verification of stability improvement in industrial structure, these proposed\nfour steps were proved to be an effective process and feasible method for enhancing the stability\nof eco-industrial system structure.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hu Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiang Sun, Xiaodong Zhu, Yangfan Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Eco-industrial chain, Structure stability, Lianyungang Xuwei New Area", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Jul 2019"}
