{"Nomor": 41216, "Judul": "COMPUTER PROGRAMFOR DIRECTED STRUCTURE TOPOLOGYOPTIMIZATION", "Abstrak": "To compensate for the imperfection of traditional bi-directional evolutionary struc-\ntural optimization, material interpolation scheme and sensitivity filter functions are introduced. A\nsuitable filter can overcome the checkerboard and mesh-dependency. And the historical informa-\ntion on accurate elemental sensitivity numbers are used to keep the objective function converging\nsteadily. Apart from rational intervals of the relevant important parameters, the concept of dis-\ntinguishing between active and non-active elements design is proposed, which can be widely used\nfor improving the function and artistry of structures directly, especially for a one whose accu-\nrate size is not given. Furthermore, user-friendly software packages are developed to enhance its\naccessibility for practicing engineers and architects. And to reduce the time cost for large time-\nconsuming complex structure optimization, parallel computing is built-in in the MATLAB codes.\nThe program is easy to use for engineers who may not be familiar with either FEA or struc-\nture optimization. And developers can make a deep research on the algorithm by changing the\nMATLAB codes. Several classical examples are given to show that the improved BESO method\nis superior for its handy and utility computer program software.", "Daftar File": {"2015 EJRNL PP Xianjie Wang 1.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/178242"}, "Penulis": "Xianjie Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xun\u2019an Zhang, Kepeng Cheng"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO), continuum structures, computer program development, improved algorithm, directed structure topology optimization, portion construction design", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 4, August, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Jul 2019"}
