{"Nomor": 43067, "Judul": "Decentralized Model Predictive Control Strategy of a Realistic Multi Power System Automatic Generation Control", "Abstrak": "This paper presents a decentralized Model\nPredictive Control (MPC) for Automatic Generation Control\n(AGC) of a realistic multi power system in Egypt with inherent\nnonlinearities. The Egyptian Power System (EPS) is\ndecomposed into three dynamic subsystems which are nonreheat,\nreheat, and hydro power plants. Moreover, each\nsubsystem has its private characteristics compared to the\nothers. Therefore, each subsystem controller has been\ndesigned independently to guarantee the stability of the overall\nclosed loop system. Hence, MPC is proposed for every\nsubsystem separately to regulate the frequency and to track\nthe load demands of EPS. The performance of the proposed\ndecentralized MPC of each subsystem is compared with the\ncentralized one at different operational scenarios. The results\nby nonlinear simulation MATLAB/SIMULINK for the\ngeneration control of EPS approves that the decentralized\npredictive model gives almost the same performance as the\ncentralized one. However, the centralized model cannot\naddress the large load disturbance and system parameters\nvariation. In contrast, the decentralized MPC scheme is more\nrobust and effective against all disturbances and operating\nconditions.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "G.
