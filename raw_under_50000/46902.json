{"Nomor": 46902, "Judul": "STRATEGI BISNIS UNTUK MENINGKATKAN OKUPANSI DARI GEDUNG PERKANTORAN SEWA DI MENARA KOMPAS, JAKARTA", "Abstrak": "Economic development in a country has a very significant influence on the development of supporting infrastructure. Especially occurs in urban areas that have a high level of supporting density with various levels of economic needs. The existence of economic development also affects the development of business and industry, where the higher the country's GDP, the greater the opportunity for business development in the country.\nWith the development of the business, a good and integrated supporting infrastructure system is also needed. In this case, TOD (Transit Oriented Development) is one solution to the existing infrastructure problems. Kompas Gramedia sees this TOD phenomenon as an opportunity to earn revenue as well as a profitable method of asset utilisation.\nThe construction of Menara Kompas building as a rented office building in the TOD area is an attractive business alternative. Today, the challenges of the leasing office business are facing a difficult time due to an excess supply of office space compared to market demand. Over the past five years, the supply of leased office space has increased significantly and has resulted in more than 40% of the available space compared to the needs in the rental office market. The excess space that is not absorbed reaches 150,000 m2. This situation has caused a phenomenon in the market called the \"tenant market\" where the tenants of the building can determine the rental pricing policy. This condition is very dangerous for the rental office business.\nThis situation has a negative impact on landlords (building owners) where an office building has a large initial capital in the form of capital expenditure which usually consists of investment and loans. At the time of operation, the landlord has a calculation of the return on investment costs along with the interest that needs to be met through building rental income. When building occupancy is low, there is a lack of income to reduce capital costs or even worse, reduce building operating costs. Buildings suffer operational losses and landlords may not be able to recover investment costs\nTherefore, it takes a creative marketing effort and maximises all the potential and resources of the company into a competitive advantage that has added value to increase the occupancy of the leased office building. Menara Kompas rental office buildings, in this case, try to respond to the situation that occurs by analysing external and internal factors in the business environment and digging deeper into the resources of the company to be used as marketing forces to increase building occupancy.\nThe analysis shows that Kompas Tower has a lot of potentials that can be utilised as a source of marketing power \u2014 starting from the use of the Kompas Gramedia ecosystem as the Head Office to collaborating with consulting companies and property management to expand the marketing network. The finding strategy of this research needs to be implemented to maintain the continuity of Menara Kompas management in the future.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Natashia Dwiyanita H Sitorus": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/204668"}, "Penulis": "Natashia Dwiyanita H Sitorus [29318085]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Anh Dung Do, MBA, Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Administrasi Bisnis", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Gedung Perkantoran Sewa, Tingkat Okupansi, Strategi Bisnis", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Roosalina Vanina Viyazza \u00a0\n                                     Roosalina Vanina Viyazza", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Mar 2020"}
