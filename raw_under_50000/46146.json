{"Nomor": 46146, "Judul": "PREPARATION OF AMORPHOUS SOLID DISPERSIONS BY CRYOMILLING: CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL CONCERNS RELATED TO ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENTS AND CARRIERS", "Abstrak": "In this work, a chemical (and physical) evaluation\nof cryogenic milling to manufacture amorphous solid dispersions\n(ASDs) is provided to support novel mechanistic insights in the\ncryomilling process. Cryogenic milling devices are considered as\nreactors in which both physical transitions (reduction in crystallite\nsize, polymorphic transformations, accumulation of crystallite defects, and partial or complete amorphization) and chemical reactions (chemical decomposition, etc.) can be mechanically triggered. In-depth characterization of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) (content determination) and polymer (viscosity, molecular weight, dynamic vapor sorption, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and ANS and thioflavin T staining) chemical decomposition demonstrated APIs to be more prone to chemical degradation in case of presence of a polymer. A significant reduction of the polymer chain length was observed and in case of BSA denaturation/aggregation. Hence, mechanochemical activation process(es) for amorphization and ASD manufacturing cannot be regarded as a mild technique, as generally put forward, and one needs to be aware of chemical degradation of both APIs and polymers.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Timothy Pas [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Alessandra Bergonzi, Emiel Michiels"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "amorphous solid dispersions (ASD), cryomilling, protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), gelatin, biopolymers, (semi)synthetic polymers, degradation, decomposition, mechanochemical activation", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Feb 2020"}
