This was the trigger of one of \nthe most serious clusters of COVID-19 in the world, outside of China. Despite aggressive restraint \nand inhibition efforts, COVID-19 continues to increase, and the total number of infected patients in \nItaly is growing daily. After six weeks the total number of patients reached 128,948 cases (April 5, \n2020), with the higher case-fatality rate (15,887 deaths) dominated by old and very old patients.  \nThis sudden health emergency severely challenged the Italian Health System, in particular \nacute care hospitals and intensive care units. In one hospital, geriatric observation units were \ncreated, the experience of which can be extremely useful for European countries, the United \nStates, and all countries that in the coming days will face a similar situation", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Gemelli Against  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["COVID-19 Geriatrics Team, F.
