{"Nomor": 46180, "Judul": "TEMPLATE-ASSISTED MAGNETRON SPUTTERING OF COTTON NONWOVENS FOR WOUND HEALING APPLICATION", "Abstrak": "In the present study, three kinds of functional wound dressings (Zn@\nCotton, Ag@Cotton, and Ag/Zn@Cotton) were developed by template-assisted\nmagnetron sputtering of cotton nonwovens. Scanning electron microscopy and energy\ndispersive spectrometry revealed a very thin, uniform silver oxides and zinc coating on the\ncotton cellulose microfibers, which was further confirmed by X-ray diffraction pattern, Xray\nphotoelectron spectrometry, and thermal gravimetric analysis. The physical\ncharacteristics such as high swelling ability, moderate air and water vapor permeabilities,\ngood mechanical properties, and excellent flexibility support the suitability of magnetron\nsputtering cotton nonwovens for wound dressing applications. Moreover, the Ag/Zn@ Cotton showed effective antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, which was mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of electrical stimulation and continuous release of Ag+/Zn2+. Meanwhile, benefiting from the low metal coating area percentage (17.54%), the Ag/Zn@Cotton exhibited good cytocompatibility. The in vitro and in vivo test show that Ag/Zn@Cotton can remarkably accelerate the wound healing process, which can be attributed to the enhanced cellular migration by electrical stimulation, strong antibacterial activity, good cytocompatibility, and excellent physical properties. Potentially, template-assisted magnetron sputtering may provide a simple, green, and sustainable alternative for the development of functional wound dressings.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Shangpeng Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jiwei Li, Shaohua Zhang, Xiying Zhang, Jianwei Ma, Na Wang, Shuang Wang, Bin Wang, and Shaojuan Chen"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "magnetron sputtering, cotton nonwovens, antibacterial, wound healing, biocompatibility", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Feb 2020"}
