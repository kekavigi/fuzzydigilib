{"Nomor": 48138, "Judul": "APPLICATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK CLASSIFICATION (UNFC) FOR RESOURCES TO JAILOLO GEOTHERMAL FIELD, INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "UNFC-2009 is the newest resource assessment method. The application of this Method is still limited in geothermal energy sector. The advantage of UNFC-2009 Method is the Method does the study for geoscience, social, economic, and environmental aspects. Thus, UNECE, cooperates with IGA, expects that the Method will become standard for geothermal resource assessment. In Indonesia, UNFC-2009 is still rarely used. For those reasons, this study aims to applicate UNFC-2009 to get resource assessment in Indonesian geothermal field. The case study which is used is Jailolo Geothermal Field, North Maluku. Jailolo Field is selected because the data of the field is easy to be found. UNFC method itself will assess the resource of the field from three aspect (i.e. socio-economic, project feasibility, and geological knowledge). In practice, the study use decision tree from Specification for The Application of UNFC-2009 to Geothermal Energy Resources to get the resource assessment.\nBased on the reference in this study, Jailolo Field is categorized as E3.2 for social and economic aspects, F3.1 for the feasibility of extraction based on maturity studies, and G4 (G4.1+G4.2+G4.3) for geological studies. It means the field is too early a stage to determine economic due to insufficient data. In the other hand, feasibility of extraction by a defined development project cannot be evaluated due to limited technical data, although site-specific geoscience studies and exploration activities have identified the potential for an geothermal resources with sufficient confidence to warrant drilling or testing. Based on geoscience studies, there are estimated quantities associated with a potential deposit, that is low-confidence estimate as 75 M.W. This study finds that the field has great potency to be commercial because many aspects have supported the development of this field. Based on this study, to upgrade the assessment and prove the commerciality of this field, the government must drill some exploration wells.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Afif Andria Ma'fu [12216054]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Heru Berian Pratama, S.T., M.T.", "Angga Bakti Pratama, S.Si., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "UNFC method, resource assessment, Jailolo Field", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Jun 2020"}
