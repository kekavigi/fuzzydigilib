{"Nomor": 41240, "Judul": "MULTISCALE SIMULATION OF INCIPIENT PLASTICITY AND DISLOCATION NUCLEATION ON NICKEL FILM DURING TILTED FLAT-ENDED NANO INDENTATION", "Abstrak": "Multiscale simulations of the tilted flat-ended nanoindentation with different tilted\nangles (from 5?\n 30?) on the (?1 1 0) surface of nickel crystal were studied using the QC method.\nThe model of the indentation is a flat-end indenter inclined by an angle \" driven into a half-\nplane vertically. Load-displacement responses, initial stages of the plasticity deformations and\ndislocation emissions for nickel film at different inclined angles were obtained and analyzed as well.\nAn energy criterion was successfully proposed to analyze the critical load for the first dislocation\nemission beneath the edge of the indenter. Simulation results agree well with analytical ones.\nAn elastic model based on the contact theory and the Peierls-Nabarro dislocation model were\ncombined to analyze when and where the dislocation will be emitted beneath the lower surface\nof an inclined indenter. Results indicate that the key parameter is the ratio of the contact half-\nwidth to the position of the slip plane. This parameter shows the range in which a dislocation\nwill probably be emitted. This mechanism explains the simulation results well. This work is of\nvalue for understanding the mechanism of dislocation emissions of FCC crystals under tilted flat-\nended nanoindentation while providing approaches to predicting when the first dislocation will\nbe emitted and where subsequent dislocations will probably be emitted.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Fanlin Zeng   [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Bing Zhao, Yi Sun"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "multiscale simulations, tilted flat-ended nanoindentation, dislocations, mechanism", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 5, October, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan \u00a0\n                                     Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Agu 2019"}
