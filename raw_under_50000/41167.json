{"Nomor": 41167, "Judul": "LONGITUDINAL VIBRATIONS OF ARBITRARY NON-UNIFORMRODS", "Abstrak": "Free and steady-state forced longitudinal vibrations of non-uniform rods are investigated\nby an iteration method, which results in a series solution. The series obtained are convergent\nand linearly independent. Its convergence is verified by convergence tests, its linear independence\nconfirmed by the nonzero value of the corresponding Wronski determinant. Then, the solution\nobtained is an exact one reducible to a classical solution for the case of uniform rods. In order to\nverify the method, two examples are presented as an application of the proposed method. The\nresults obtained are equivalent to the method in literature. In contrast to the proposed method capable\nof dealing with arbitrary non-uniform rods in principle, the method in literature is confined\nto work on special cases.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Shuqi Guo [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Shaopu Yang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "longitudinal vibration, arbitrary non-uniform rod, series solution, convergence", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 2, April, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Jul 2019"}
