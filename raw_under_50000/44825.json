{"Nomor": 44825, "Judul": "Locality and heating in periodically driven, power-law-interacting systems", "Abstrak": "We study the heating time in periodically driven D-dimensional systems with interactions that decay with the distance r as a power law 1/r?. Using linear-response theory, we show that the heating time is exponentiallylong as a function of the drive frequency for ? > D. For systems that may not obey linear-response theory, we use a more general Magnus-like expansion to show the existence of quasiconserved observables, whichimply exponentially long heating time, for? > 2D. We also generalize a number of recent state-of-the-art Lieb-Robinson bounds for power-law systems from two-body interactions to k-body interactions and thereby obtain alonger heating time than previously established in the literature. Additionally, we conjecture that the gap betweenthe results from the linear-response theory and the Magnus-like expansion does not have physical implications, but is, rather, due to the lack of tight Lieb-Robinson bounds for power-law interactions. We show that the gapvanishes in the presence of a hypothetical, tight bound.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Minh C. Tran [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Adam Ehrenberg ,", "Andrew Y.
