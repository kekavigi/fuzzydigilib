{"Nomor": 46382, "Judul": "CHLORIDE ION TRANSPORT BY PITENINS ACROSS THE PHOSPHOLIPID BILAYERS OF VESICLES AND CELLS", "Abstrak": "Small-molecule-based Cl? ion carriers are gaining revived attention\nbecause of their recently discovered role toward anticancer activity. Herein, we\nshowed that the anticancer agents, PITENINs, have an efficient transmembrane\nCl? ion transport activity. Theoretical calculations, 1H NMR titration, and\nspectrophotometric analysis suggest that the PITENINs strongly bind with a Cl?\nion. In addition to the lipophilicity, the presence of both acylthiourea and phenolic\nOH moieties of the compounds plays a crucial role in the transport of Cl? ions.\nAmong the tested compounds, PIT-1 and DM-PIT-1 showed higher Cl? ion\nselectivity and transport efficiency. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the\npotent compounds follow the H+/Cl? transport pathway. Cellular activity studies\nshowed that the disruption of Cl? ion homeostasis by PIT-1 and DM-PIT-1\npreferentially promotes apoptotic cell death.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Oindrila Biswas [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Nasim Akhtar, Yoya Vashi, Abhishek Saha, Vishnu Kumar, Sudipa Pal, Sachin Kumar, Debasis Manna"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "acylthiourea, apoptosis, bilayers, ion transporter, PITENINs", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "03 Mar 2020"}
