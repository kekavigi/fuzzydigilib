{"Nomor": 40804, "Judul": "MECHANICAL AND ACOUSTIC RESPONSEOF AN UNDERWATER STRUCTURE SUBJECTED TO MECHANICAL EXCITATION", "Abstrak": "In this paper, an underwater structure is modeled as a cylindrical shell with internal\nbulkheads, and closed by a truncated conical shell, and it consists of metal substrate and sound\nabsorbing coating, whose FGM core is considered. Suppose the inner cavity and outer space of\nthe structure are filled with air and fluid mediums, the mechanical response of the underwater\nstructure is calculated with Galerkin method while the acoustic response is investigated by means\nof the Helmholtz integral. Some numerical examples are given and the effect of geometrical size\nand material parameters on mechanical and acoustic response is discussed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xuetao Weng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Shijian Zhu, Hongliang Dai, Yiming Fu, Yiqi Mao"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "underwater structure, acoustic response, functionally graded material, boundary element method, Helmholtz integral formula", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 27, No. 3, June, 2014", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Jul 2019"}
