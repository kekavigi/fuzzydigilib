{"Nomor": 44682, "Judul": "Innovative Interior Designs for Urban Freight Distribution Using Light Rail Systems", "Abstrak": "High levels of pollution and congestion in urban\ncentres are an increasing concern for local councils in the\nUK. Heavy goods vehicles delivering urban freight to city\ncentres are a leading cause of this problem. This paper\ndiscusses the concept of using light rail networks to deliver\nfreight to city centres from surrounding businesses.\nSpecifically, various innovative designs are considered for\nthe interior of the metro carriage and developed into visual\nmodels using Autodesk Inventor software. A full evaluation of all the designs developed is completed, resulting in\na proposed design for consideration. The conclusion\nreached is that the proposed interior design is viable and\ncoincides with the future metro fleet designs and concepts.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "James Kelly [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Marin Marinov"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Metro  Urban freight  Interior design Autodesk Inventor  Tyne and Wear metro  Light rail Urban environment", "Sumber": "Urban Rail Transit (2017) 3(4):238\u2013254", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Okt 2019"}
