{"Nomor": 45155, "Judul": "Numerical Study Of Influence Of Hydraulic Fracturing On Fluid Flow In Natural Fractures", "Abstrak": "The hydraulic fracturing operation is highly complex in fractured reservoirs. The fundamental key to a successful\noperation is processing and analysis of the propagation of hydraulic fracturing in a natural fracture network. In\nthis paper, the hydraulic fracturing process is evaluated in a fractured reservoir in southwest Iran. The developing process of induced fracture in a natural fracture network is analysed by the Distinct Element Method\n(DEM). After determining the fluid flow regime in the natural fractures of the reservoir, hydraulic fracturing is\napplied along different lengths of the reservoir and in each range, the production rate is checked. Fluid flow in\nnatural fractures after the hydraulic fracturing operation is shown and evaluated in order to evaluate the induced\nfracture effectiveness in enhancing fluid flow regimes in the reservoir. The reverse suction phenomenon which\ncauses changes in the fluid flow pattern in fractures and will thus affect the production rate is also studied in this\npaper. Fracture coalescence will cause the induction of natural fractures to hydraulically fracture without their\nintersection; this is one of the significant parameters in hydraulic fracturing in naturally fractured reservoirs\nwhich is also discussed in detail. This paper can present valuable information on fluid flow analysis before and\nafter applying hydraulic fracturing in a fractured reservoir and solve some essential ambiguities in this area.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "JABER TAHERI-SHAKIBA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Amir Ghaderib", "Mohammad Amin Sharif Nik"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Hydraulic fracture, Fractured reservoirs, Production, Coalescence, Fluid flow", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 5, Issue 3, Pages 321-328 (September 2019), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.10.005", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Nov 2019"}
