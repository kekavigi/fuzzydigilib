{"Nomor": 40805, "Judul": "MICROMECHANICALMODELLINGOF PHASE TRANSFORMATIONBEHAVIOUR OFA TRANSITIONAL SOIL", "Abstrak": "Experiments show that silts and silty soils exhibit contraction followed by dilation\nduring shearing and the slope of failure line decreases at large strains, termed as phase trans-\nformation behaviour. This paper is to develop a new micromechanical stress-strain model that\naccounts for the phase transformation behaviour by explicitly employing the phase transformation\nline and its related friction angles. The overall strain includes plastic sliding and plastic compres-\nsion among grains. The internal-friction angle at the phase transformation state and the void state\nvariable are employed to describe the phase transformation behaviour. The model is examined by\nsimulating undrained and drained triaxial compression tests performed on Pitea silts. The local\nstress-strain behaviour for contact planes is also investigated.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Chuang Yu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zhenyu Yin, Dongmei Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "micromechanics, silts, constitutive models, elastoplasticity, anisotropy, simulation", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 27, No. 3, June, 2014", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Jul 2019"}
