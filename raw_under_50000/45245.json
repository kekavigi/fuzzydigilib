{"Nomor": 45245, "Judul": "Structural Invertibility and Optimal Sensor Node Placement for Error and Input Reconstruction in Dynamic Systems", "Abstrak": "Despite recent progress in our understanding of complex dynamic networks, it remains challenging to\ndevise sufficiently accurate models to observe, control, or predict the state of real systems in biology,\neconomics, or other fields. A largely overlooked fact is that these systems are typically open and receive\nunknown inputs from their environment. A further fundamental obstacle is structural model errors caused\nby insufficient or inaccurate knowledge about the quantitative interactions in the real system. Here, we\nshow that unknown inputs to open systems and model errors can be treated under the common framework of invertibility, which is a requirement for reconstructing these disturbances from output measurements. By exploiting the fact that invertibility can be decided from the influence graph of the system, we analyze the relationship between structural network properties and invertibility under different realistic scenarios. We show that sparsely connected scale-free networks are the most difficult to invert. We introduce a new sensor node placement algorithm to select a minimum set of measurement positions in the network required for invertibility. This algorithm facilitates optimal experimental design for the reconstruction of inputs or model errors from output measurements. Our results have both fundamental and practical implications for nonlinear systems analysis, modeling, and design.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Dominik Kahl [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Philipp Wendland, Matthias Neidhardt, Andreas Weber, and Maik Kschischo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW X 9, 041046 (2019), APS", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Des 2019"}
