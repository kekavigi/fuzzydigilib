{"Nomor": 46139, "Judul": "ACTIVITY-BASED SENSING METHODS FOR MONITORING THE REACTIVE CARBON SPECIES CARBON MONOXIDE AND FORMALDEHYDE IN LIVING SYSTEMS", "Abstrak": "Carbon is central to the chemistry of life, and in addition to\nits fundamental roles as a static component of all major biomolecules spanning\nproteins, nucleic acids, sugars, and lipids, emerging evidence shows that small\nand transient carbon-based metabolites, termed reactive carbon species\n(RCS), are dynamic signaling/stress agents that can influence a variety of\nbiological pathways. Recent examples include the identification of carbon\nmonoxide (CO) as an ion channel blocker and endogenous formaldehyde\n(FA) as a one-carbon metabolic unit formed from the spontaneous\ndegradation of dietary folate metabolites. These findings motivate the\ndevelopment of analytical tools for transient carbon species that can achieve\nhigh specificity and sensitivity to further investigate RCS signaling and stress\npathways at the cell, tissue, and whole-organism levels. This Account\nsummarizes work from our laboratory on the development of new chemical\ntools to monitor two important one-carbon RCS, CO and FA, through\nactivity-based sensing (ABS), where we leverage the unique chemical\nreactivities of these small and transient analytes, rather than lock-and-key\nbinding considerations, for selective detection. Classic inorganic/organometallic\nand organic transformations form the basis for this approach....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jun Ohata [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["? Kevin J.
