{"Nomor": 44880, "Judul": "Experimental And Numerical Study Of Multiphase Flow Phenomena And Models In Oil & Gas Industry", "Abstrak": "Multiphase flows, including gas-liquid, gas-solid, liquid-liquid, liquid-solid, and solid-liquid-liquid flows, exist in many fields such as\npetroleum, power, chemical, food, biomedical, metallurgical, nuclear,\nand hydraulic engineering. In the Oil & Gas industry, they play a key\nrole due to its presence in many phases of oil and gas\u2019 production and\ntransportation and, especially as fields become more economically\nmarginal, there is growing demand to model and predict the detailed\nthermo-fluid dynamic behavior of those flows and the phenomena that\nthey manifest. Studies on phase distribution and heat or mass transfer\nare fundamental to give insight into the complicated principle and the\napplication prospect", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ALESSANDRO TERENZI  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Barbara Marchetti", "Mariella Leporini", "Pietro Poesio", "Jianjun Liu", "Wuhan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Multiphase Flow Phenomena, Oil, Gas, Industry", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 5, Issue 2, Pages 113 (June  2019), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2019.04.004", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Nov 2019"}
