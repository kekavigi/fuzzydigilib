{"Nomor": 41566, "Judul": "Perfect link routing for energy efficient forwarding in geographic routing", "Abstrak": "Geographic routing has been widely advocated for use with multihop ad hoc and sensor\nnetworks because of its scalability and use of only local information. These types of networks\ntypically have lossy links where the instantaneous quality of a wireless link can vary\nsignificantly presenting a trade-off between hop length and link quality. In this paper we\nrevisit the question of energy efficient geographic routing for such networks and argue\nin favour of Perfect Link Routing, an extreme form of blacklisting with a fall-back option.\nExisting research has favoured cost-based methods where all links are considered for\nrouting. We argue, however, that a discontinuity exists between the cost of perfect links\n(those with virtually guaranteed delivery) and other links. This is based on a more careful\nuse of acknowledgements which we suggest ought to be considered a function of individual\nlinks. Revisiting the original analysis we find that for energy efficiency, perfect links\nshould be favoured except in low-density networks where such a scheme leads to very\npoor delivery rates. A hybrid approach is proposed which we call Perfect Link Routing\nand this method is shown to outperform alternatives for a number of ARQ schemes.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "A.
