One of the factors is ultraviolet light which can induce expression of cathepsin g that can increase\nmatrix metalloproteinase which degrade extracellular matix and eventually damage the skin. Some plants\nsuch as Curcuma heyneana, Psidium guajava, and Murayya paniculata are traditionally used as cosmetics\nthat have function to protect skin from skin problems. The objective of this study was to predict cathepsin\ng inhibitory activity and safety of several compounds derived from Curcuma heyneana, Psidium guajava,\nand Murraya paniculata using in silico method. A total of 34 compounds were grouped based on their\norigin and functional groups and were assessed by docking method using Autodock application. Five\ncompounds with the lowest free energy estimation representing each functional group were further\nstudied using molecular dynamics simulation method using AMBER application with MM-GBSA calculation\nmethod and the compounds toxicity was predicted using ADMET Predictor application. (2-[3-({Methyl[1-(2-\nNaphthoyl)Piperidin-4-yl] Amino} Carbonyl )-2-Naphthyl ] -1-(1-Naphthyl )-2-Oxo Ethyl phosphonic acid) or\nKPA used as reference compound and having a binding free energy value of -28.6078 kcal/mol and the\ncandidate compounds having binding free energy value in the range of -12.0316 to -29.8995 kcal/mol. The\nresults of the toxicity prediction showed that the candidate compounds were relatively non-toxic. Based\non the data obtained that all candidate compounds were not toxic, and one of the compounds which was\nguaijaverin had a lower binding free energy compared to reference compounds.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Raden Haekal Nur Fadhilah Roch": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/204036"}, "Penulis": "Raden Haekal Nur Fadhilah Roch [10715017]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. rer. nat.
