Using a combined storytelling and clay modelling task\nand an analysis of the clay models in terms of a physical ontological concept, we observed the visual-like abstraction of\ncongenitally blind individuals. Next, we observed their distinct mental lexicon construction through an analysis of how\nthey include attributive adjectives of an animal\u2019s savageness using semantic memory. The results demonstrated that\nvisual thinking is a conflict between immature visual cognitive resource with critical adult logic induced by the absence\nof visual recognition and the proper resources for a mental lexicon. This leads to feelings of estrangement, which allows\nthis ambiguous concept to occur. To capture visual phenomena, their brain harnesses another particular mode of\nthinking, associative and/or bisociative thinking, as a referral in addition to employing self-body referencing as an\narchetype. We discuss how these findings can be applied to possible employment opportunities for people with visual\nimpairments.", "Daftar File": {"2020 FSRD 1- JRNL": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/208763"}, "Penulis": "Deny Willy Junaidy", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Ilmu Seni Rupa dan Desain", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Seni Rupa dan Desain", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Visual Thinking, Congenitally Blind, Creativity, Bisociative Thinking, Clay Modeling", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "05 Jul 2020"}
