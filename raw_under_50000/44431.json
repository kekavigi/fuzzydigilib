{"Nomor": 44431, "Judul": "TELESCOPE WINS FUNDING REPRIEVE", "Abstrak": "The US National Science Foundation (NSF) will continue to fund operations at the Green\nBank Observatory in West Virginia, which is home to the world\u2019s largest fully steerable radio\ntelescope. In a decision announced during a 23 September briefing, the agency said that it\nwould give the facility US$37 million over the next five years. The move comes seven years\nafter an NSF committee recommended that the agency divest from the observatory to free up\nmoney for newer telescopes. But subsequent studies showed that Green Bank remains\na cutting-edge astronomical facility and is worth the investment, NSF officials said at the\nbriefing. The observatory currently receives $8.4 million per year from the NSF; under the\nnew agreement, the amount will drop slightly but will never be below $7 million annually.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SEVEN DAYS [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Astronomi", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "TELESCOPE", "Sumber": "3 OCTOBER 2019 | VOL 574 | NATURE | 11", "Staf Input/Edit": "pustaka bosscha", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Okt 2019"}
