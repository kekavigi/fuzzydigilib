{"Nomor": 45267, "Judul": "Triassic Petroleum System As An Alternative Exploration Concept In Ofshore Western Timor Indonesia", "Abstrak": "Located in the north-western part of Bonaparte Basin, ofshore western Timor presents the opportunity for a distinct exploration concept due to the discovery of the Abadi gas feld. A classic Jurassic petroleum play did not develop as a proven\nreservoir and source rock in the study area due to severe erosion during the Valanginian event. Therefore, the Triassic interval\nrequires assessment to reveal an alternative petroleum system in the study area. A petroleum system analysis utilising 2D\nseismic lines and three exploration wells was performed to construct a new exploration concept. The study showed that the\nScythian Mount Goodwin interval could be considered a primary gas-prone source rock, with type II/III kerogen, a total\norganic content up to 2.09% and a hydrogen index that could reach 569 mg/g. Based on a study of a pseudo-well conducted\nhere, the Mount Goodwin interval is found to have reached gas generation in the Early Cretaceous and expulsion in the Early\nEocene. The potential reservoir rocks are the Carnian\u2013Ladinian Challis and Anisian Pollard intervals. The Challis interval,\nthe primary reservoir, has typical shoreline sandstones and is interbedded with claystones and limestone intercalations.\nPetrophysical and petrographic studies in this interval indicate good reservoir properties. However, the Pollard interval\nmainly consists of carbonates with minor claystones and has a low quality of reservoir properties. The intraformational shale\nof the Challis is considered as the potential regional seal, especially within areas that are not truncated by the Valanginian\nevent. From the perspective of exploration, the Jurassic north-east\u2013south-west-tilted fault blocks are still favourable for new\ndiscoveries in the ofshore western Timor area.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SUGENG S.
