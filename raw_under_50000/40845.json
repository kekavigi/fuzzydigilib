{"Nomor": 40845, "Judul": "FREE TRANSVERSE VIBRATIONS OFA DOUBLE-WALLED CARBON N ANOTUBE: GRADIENT AND INTERNAL INERTIA EFFECTS", "Abstrak": "This is a modest contribution on higher-order continuum theory for predicting size\neffects in small-scale objects. It relates to a preceding article of the journal by the same authors\n(AMSS, 2013, 26: 9-20) which considered the longitudinal dynamical analysis of a gradient elastic\nfiber but, in addition to an internal length, an internal time parameter is also introduced to\nmodel delay/acceleration effects associated with the underlying microstructure. In particular, the\nfree transverse vibration of a double-walled carbon nanotube (DWNT) is studied by employing\ngradient elasticity with internal inertia. The inner and outer carbon nanotubes are modeled as two\nindividual elastic beams interacting with each other through van derWaals (vdW) forces. General\nexplicit expressions are derived for the natural frequencies and the associated inner-to-outer tube\namplitude ratios for the case of simply supported DWNTs. The effects of internal length (or scale)\nand internal time (or inertia) on the vibration behavior are evaluated. The results indicate that\nthe internal length and time parameters of the adopted strain gradient-internal inertia generalized\nelasticity model have little influence on the lower order coaxial and noncoaxial vibration modes,\nbut a significant one on the higher order modes.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "K.
