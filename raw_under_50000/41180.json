The effective elastic constants of prismatic cellular materials are obtained by the homog-\nenization method. By applying the variational principle and introducing the dual variables, the\ncanonical equations of Hamiltonian system are constructed. Thereafter, the wave propagation\nproblem is converted to an eigenvalue problem. In numerical examples, the effects of the pris-\nmatic cellular topology, the relative density, and the boundary conditions on dispersion relations,\nrespectively, are investigated.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Junmiao Meng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zichen Deng, Xiaojian Xu, Kai Zhang, Xiuhui Hou"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "extendedWittrick-Williams algorithm, cellular material, Hamiltonian system, dis- persion relation", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 4, August, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Jul 2019"}
