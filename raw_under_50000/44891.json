{"Nomor": 44891, "Judul": "Slug Catcher Finger-Type CFD Simulator For Two-Phase Flow Separation", "Abstrak": "Slug catcher is an important and costly equipment in the up-stream assets, but is the less supported by\nresearch or commercial simulation software in terms of design and sizing criteria.\nThe purpose of this paper is to present a simulation model based on the open-source software for\ncomputational fluid-dynamics OpenFOAM\u00ae, which can assist during the preliminary sizing, made by the\nusual simplified methods, proving the fluid-dynamic behaviour and drive the process engineers to an\noptimum final design by checking all the expected production profiles of the related oil/gas field, for a\ncomprehensive and safe operation all along the reservoir life.\nThe slug catcher main function is to ensure the separation of the phases within the acceptance\nspecifications dictated by the process units of downstream CPF (Central Production Facility).\nThe optimization of the slug catcher could allow the reduction of the equipment overall dimensions,\nthat is essential to reduce the capital expenditure and make the installation more flexible.\nThe graphic output is a strong tool in the hand of engineers, following the fluid-dynamic response of\nthe slug catcher in the gas-liquid separation section, in function of the flow pattern at the entrance and\nsuperficial velocities of the phases.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ALESSIO PIERRO [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Simone Spadoni", "Francesco Chiappetta", "Francesco Ferrini"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Catcher finger-type, Two-phase flow separation, oil, gas", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 5, Issue 2, Pages 133-140 (June  2019), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2017.12.006", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Nov 2019"}
