{"Nomor": 44796, "Judul": "Aging of a quantum battery", "Abstrak": "We study the use of ensembles of quantum two-level systems as batteries to store and release radiative energy. Collective coupling to a tuneable cavity mode leads to enhanced charging power and a means to recover the energy on demand in a controllable manner. Individual decay and decoherence of the emitters occur on a much slower timescale, but they gradually cause population of states with lower symmetry and similar to the aging of rechargeable household batteries, they reduce the efficiency of the battery with time.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Faezeh Pirmoradian [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Klaus M\u00f8lmer"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW A 100, 043833 (2019), APS", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Nov 2019"}
