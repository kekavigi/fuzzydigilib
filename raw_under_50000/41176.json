The governing equations of the interaction system are established first, and the\nsolution procedure and assembly method of the coupling element are demonstrated. Finally, the\naccuracy, efficiency and function of the integrated coupling element are tested using two numerical\nexamples. The influences of different combinations of rail and bridge element length in the coupling\nelement on the solution are investigated, and the effects of different rail irregularities on the\ndynamic responses are discussed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hongyin Yang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zhijun Chen, Shaofan Li, Hailong Zhang, Jianping Fan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "vehicle-rail-bridge dynamic interaction, integrated coupling element, non-uniform continuous beam, wheel-rail contact, rail irregularity", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 3, June, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Jul 2019"}
