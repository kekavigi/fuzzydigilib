{"Nomor": 44698, "Judul": "Suitability of Tilting Technology to the Tyne and Wear Metro System", "Abstrak": "This paper attempts to determine the suitability\nof tilting technology as applied to metro systems, taking\nthe Tyne and Wear Metro as its base case study. This is\ndone through designing and implementing of several tests\nwhich show the current metro situation and reveals possible impacts on ride comfort and speed, in case tilting\ntechnology has been implemented. The paper provides\nbrief background literature review on tilting technology, its\ndifferent designs and types, control systems, customer\nsatisfaction and history on the Tyne and Wear metro system. Ride comfort evaluation methods, testing of the Metro\nfleet comfort levels and simulation modelling through the\nuse of OpenTrack simulator software are also introduced.\nResults and findings include test accuracy and validations\nand suggest that although tilting technology could be\nbeneficial with respect to speed (minimal improvements)\nand comfort, implementing it to the Tyne and Wear metro\nwould be an unwise decision owing to the immense amount\nof upgrades that would be needed on both the network and\nthe metro car fleet. Therefore, recommendations are subsequently made on alternative systems which could achieve\nor surpass the levels of comfort achievable by tilting\ntechnology without the need for an outright overhaul of\nlines and trains.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Agajere Ovuezirie Darlton [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Marin Marinov"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering of railroads & roads", "Kata Kunci": "Tilting technology  Tyne and wear metro OpenTrack  Simulation  Lateral acceleration  Ride comfor", "Sumber": "Urban Rail Transit (2015) 1(1):47\u201368", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Okt 2019"}
