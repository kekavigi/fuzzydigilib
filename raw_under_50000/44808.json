{"Nomor": 44808, "Judul": "The Productivity Calculation Model Of Perforated Horizontal Well And Optimization Of Inflow Profile", "Abstrak": "Aiming at the large error in productivity predication and incomplete consideration in completion parameters design of perforated horizontal well, a model which coupled the relationship of pressure and\nflow rate in reservoir seepage, near-wellbore inflow and wellbore flow was established. The impact of\nnear-wellbore heterogeneity, wellbore flow pressure drop and completion parameters on the inflow\nprofile of horizontal well is analysed. Studies showed that with a stronger near-wellbore heterogeneity,\ntheinflow profilewouldfluctuatemore seriously. Perforation density had a greatinfluence on the inflow\nprofile and local changes of it would bring a shunt effect. Completion design of variable density\nperforated horizontal well with an optimized inflow profile which was close to a standard profile would\nimprove the horizontal well development effect. The achievement can provide directive meanings to\nproductivity predication and completion parameters design of horizontal wells in oilfield", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "XIANBO LUO [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Lifu Jiang", "Yanchun Su", "Kai Huang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Horizontal well, Productivity model, Variable density perforation, Inflow profile", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 2, Pages 154-157 (September  2015),    http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.04.002", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Nov 2019"}
