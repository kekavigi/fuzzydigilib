{"Nomor": 44779, "Judul": "Characterizing Hydraulic Fractures In Shale Gas Reservoirs Using Transient Pressure Tests", "Abstrak": "Hydraulic fracturing combined with horizontal drilling has been the technology that makes it\npossible to economically produce natural gas from unconventional shale gas or tight gas reservoirs.\nHydraulic fracturing operations, in particular, multistage fracturing treatments along with horizontal wells in unconventional formations create complex fracture geometries or networks, which\nare difficult to characterize. The traditional analysis using a single vertical or horizontal fracture\nconcept may be no longer applicable. Knowledge of these created fracture properties, such as their\nspatial distribution, extension and fracture areas, is essential information to evaluate stimulation\nresults. However, there are currently few effective approaches available for quantifying hydraulic\nfractures in unconventional reservoirs.\nThis work presents an unconventional gas reservoir simulator and its application to quantify\nhydraulic fractures in shale gas reservoirs using transient pressure data. The numerical model incorporates most known physical processes for gas production from unconventional reservoirs,\nincluding two-phase flow of liquid and gas, Klinkenberg effect, non-Darcy flow, and nonlinear\nadsorption. In addition, the model is able to handle various types and scales of fractures or heterogeneity using continuum, discrete or hybrid modeling approaches under different well production conditions of varying rate or pressure. Our modeling studies indicate that the most\nsensitive parameter of hydraulic fractures to early transient gas flow through extremely low\npermeability rock is actually the fracture-matrix contacting area, generated by fracturing stimulation. Based on this observation, it is possible to use transient pressure testing data to estimate the\narea of fractures generated from fracturing operations. We will conduct a series of modeling studies\nand present a methodology using typical transient pressure responses, simulated by the numerical\nmodel, to estimate fracture areas created or to quantity hydraulic fractures with traditional well\ntesting technology. The type curves of pressure transients from this study can be used to quantify\nhydraulic fractures in field application", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "CONG WANG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yushu Wu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Hydraulic fractures, Shale gas reservoirs, Transient pressure tests, Reservoir simulation, Formation characterization, Gas adsorption", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 2, Pages 133-138 (September  2015),  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.05.002", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "05 Nov 2019"}
