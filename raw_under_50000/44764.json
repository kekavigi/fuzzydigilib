{"Nomor": 44764, "Judul": "The Design And Simulation Of New Downhole Vibration Deviceabout Acoustic Oil Recovery Technology", "Abstrak": "More and more oilfields are using acoustic technology to enhance oil recovery. In order to know the\nmechanism of acoustic oil recovery technology, the sound radiator of a new downhole vibration\ndevice is modeled and analyzed. Based on the theoretical background, this paper firstly analyzes\nthe acoustic mechanism for the oil reservoir and then makes a acoustic response analysis on the\nsound radiator model for frequency and time-domain investigation by using professional acoustic\nsimulation softwareeLMS Virtual.lab Acoustics, finally calculates the acoustic transmission loss in\nthe downhole oil reservoir. The research reveals that firstly, acoustic waves have influences on the\noil & water fluidity in the oil reservoir, the oil pressure gradient and the interfacial tension of\ncapillary; secondly, the acoustic radiation power and sound pressure of field point attain a peak on\nthe natural frequency of the sound radiator; thirdly, with the acoustic impact, the sound pressure of\noil reservoir would fluctuate so as to improve the oil recovery ratio; the last but not the least one is\nboth the sound pressure of oil reservoir point and the transmission loss of rock have a positive\ncorrelation with the vibration frequency. Therefore, it is of great importance for the research of\nvibration frequency and structure optimization of sound radiator", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "YONGJUN HOU [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ran Zhou", "Xiaokang Long", "Peng Liu", "Yunhao Fu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Oil recovery ratio, The acoustic oil recovery technology, The sound radiator, LMS Virtual.lab Acoustics, The acoustic response analysis, The transmission loss", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 3, Pages 257-263 (September  2015),  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.09.001", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "05 Nov 2019"}
