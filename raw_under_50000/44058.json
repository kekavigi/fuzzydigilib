{"Nomor": 44058, "Judul": "GIS-BASED MULTI-CRITERIA DECISION-MAKING APPROACH FOR SITE SELECTION OF CROSS-DOCKING FACILITY IN A RETAIL SUPPLY CHAIN", "Abstrak": "Traffic congestion is a critical issue in nearly all over the globe. To date, the\nbottleneck has gotten into a new chapter. Not only occurs in the collector and\narterial road segments, but it has also penetrated to the highways, which become\none of the base aspects in respect to mobility management. The construction of a\ntoll road is intended to increase the mobility and accessibility of people and goods\nthat will affect regional development and economic improvement. However, with\nthe above phenomenon, it cannot be avoided that the traffic condition on the\nhighways has become increasingly alarming as has happened in several\nmetropolitan areas. Besides providing a direct impact on road users, congestion on\nthe toll roads also affects retail franchise companies which play an essential role in\ndistributing daily needs to the communities. Therefore, companies have to spend\nmore costs due to waste both in terms of transport as well as productivity.\nA direct-shipment is claimed to bring in lower transport cost if only the suppliers\nand customers are located in the same geographical terrain, yet, for long-distance\nsuppliers-customers location, they may gain cost saving from the cross-docking\nimplementation. However, for a short-distance origin and destination, increasing\ndemand for products has caused retail companies to allocate more trucks, which\neventually escalate the number of freight vehicles going through the toll roads. With\na large number of freight trucks operated in their supply chain, it has supplemented\nsignificantly to congestion on the highways. Thus, a cross-docking idea, which is\none of the distribution strategies, is proposed in this research.\nA challenging issue in a cross-docking system for long-term planning involves the\ndecision of facility location. The development of a cross-docking facility for a retail\ncompany is expected to make the performance, especially products shipment to the\noutlets, run more effective and efficient. This research will focus on providing aii\ncomprehensive site selection framework for the cross-docking facility within a city\nterritory from multiple criteria as well as multiple stakeholders.\nFirstly, eight criteria for the site selection are identified, i.e. zoning, flood-prone,\ncloseness to toll booth, road accessibility, outlet proximity, population size, land\nprice, and transport cost. Meanwhile, criteria weights are derived from pairwise\ncomparison using Row Geometric Mean Method (RGMM). It involves 18 experts\ncoming from three distinct dimensions, namely academic, business, and\ngovernment. Exploiting the criteria performance and consensus criteria weights,\nsuitability analysis is carried out in ArcGIS. Specifically, it exerts minimization\nweighted sum method on raster-based map layers. This analysis generates 234\nsuitable locations for establishing cross-docking facility. Explore more deeply to\nthe preferred locations which is in the rank 1; it unfolds that the suitability is\nprincipally rendered by the flood-free, transport cost, area zonation, outlet\nproximity, road accessibility, and land price factors. Meanwhile, the closeness to\ntoll booth is mediocre. Regrettably, these areas cannot meet the criterion of the\ngreatest population size.\nHereinafter, a further analysis is performed to evaluate the proposed locations\nwhether they are robust to weights changes that might occur or not. By\nsuperimposing the suitability surface to three new layers from different\nperspectives, which their weights also calculated using RGMM, it affirms that\n57.27% sites could maintain their best rank. It implies that 134 locations are robust\nto weights changes. In addition, integrated uncertainty and sensitivity analysis\nproves that the chosen locations pose a low uncertainty and a tiny percentage of\noutput variance coming from independent inputs. Then, the opted sites are worth to\npropose to be the cross-docking facility.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Zusnita Meyrawati": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184368", "BAB 1 Zusnita Meyrawati": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184369", "BAB 2 Zusnita Meyrawati": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184370", "BAB 3 Zusnita Meyrawati": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184371", "BAB 4 Zusnita Meyrawati": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184372", "BAB 5 Zusnita Meyrawati": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184373", "DAFTAR Zusnita Meyrawati": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184374", "2019 TS PP ZUSNITA MEYRAWATI_JURNAL.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184375"}, "Penulis": "Zusnita Meyrawati [25417045]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Shanty Yulianti Rachmat, S.T., M.T., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Perencanaan Wilayah dan Kota", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Arsitektur, Perencanaan dan Pengembangan Kebijakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "GIS-based MCDM, retail, cross-docking, site selection", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yoninur Almira", "File": "8 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Okt 2019"}
