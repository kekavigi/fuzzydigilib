{"Nomor": 41475, "Judul": "THE FORMATION OF JUPITERS'S DILLUTED CORE BY A GIANT IMPACT", "Abstrak": "The Juno mission1 has provided an accurate determination of Jupiter\u2019s gravitational field2 , which has been used to obtain information about the planet\u2019s composition and internal structure. Several models of Jupiter\u2019s structure that fit the probe\u2019s data suggest\nthat the planet has a diluted core, with a total heavy-element mass ranging from ten to a few tens of Earth masses (about 5 to 15 per cent of the Jovian mass), and that  heavy elements (elements other than hydrogen and helium) are distributed within a region extending to nearly half of Jupiter\u2019s radius3,4. Planet-formation models indicate\nthat most heavy elements are accreted during the early stages of a planet's formation to create a relatively compact core5\u20137  and that almost no solids are accreted during subsequent runaway gas accretion8\u201310. Jupiter\u2019s diluted core, combined with its possible high heavy-element enrichment, thus challenges standard planetformation theory. A possible explanation is erosion of the initially compact heavy-element core, but the efficiency of such erosion is uncertain and depends on both the immiscibility of heavy materials in metallic hydrogen and on convective mixing as the planet\nevolves11,12. Another mechanism that can explain this structure is planetesimal enrichment and vaporization13\u201315 during the formation process, although relevant models typically cannot produce an extended diluted core. Here we show that a sufficiently energetic head-on collision (giant impact) between a large planetary embryo\nand the proto-Jupiter could have shattered its primordial compact core and mixed the heavy elements with the inner envelope. Models of such a scenario lead to an internal structure that is consistent with a diluted core, persisting over billions of years. We suggest that collisions were common in the young Solar system and that a\nsimilar event may have also occurred for Saturn, contributing to the structural differences between Jupiter and Saturn16\u201318", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SHANG, Fei Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["HORI, Y et al"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Astronomi", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "planetary", "Sumber": "15 AUGUS T 2019 | VOL 572 | NA T U RE | 355", "Staf Input/Edit": "pustaka bosscha", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "16 Agu 2019"}
