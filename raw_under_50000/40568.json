{"Nomor": 40568, "Judul": "REPLY TO MOON", "Abstrak": "I am grateful to Moon et al.1  and Lanzante2 for their interest in my original Letter3, the results of which can be summarized as follows.Using the available historical record of regional and global tropical\ncyclone tracks for the period 1949\u20132016, I found that the forward translation speed of tropical cyclones is generally slower in the later periods than in the earlier periods. The potential impacts of such a slowdown\nand a possible link to anthropogenic climate change were discussed. Such a link can be considered in terms of a growing number of previous studies that show a general weakening of general atmospheric\ncirculation patterns in a warming climate4\u201311. In the broadest sense, it can be argued that Arctic amplification12,13 is expected to slow the general circulation through the reduction of meridional temperature and pressure gradients. Since tropical cyclones are largely carried passively within these circulation patterns, it is reasonable to say that the observed slowdown of tropical-cyclone translation speed is consistent, at least in sign, with expected circulation changes forced by anthropogenic factors.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "J.P.
