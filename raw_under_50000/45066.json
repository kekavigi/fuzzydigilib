{"Nomor": 45066, "Judul": "Empirical Analysis For The Characterization Of Geo-Mechanical Strength And Pressure Regime: Implications On Hydraulic Fracturing Stimulation", "Abstrak": "Among the several activities involved in oil exploration are the determination of hydrocarbon in-place\nand mechanical competency of the oil reservoir. The pressure regimes of the formation have also\nbecome vital properties which must be well known to ensure preliminary awareness of the hydraulic\nfracturing. This study seeks to adopt a prediction strategy of the overall geo-mechanical competency and\nstrength of the formation, using a less stressful computational process and an empirical analysis,\ndeveloped using three wells from ED BON area in parts of Niger Delta.\nElastic constants such as Poisson Ratio, Young's, Shear and Bulk moduli which are the parameters for\ncharacterizing rock mechanical properties were estimated, as well as the subsurface formation pressures\nand the associated fracture gradient using P-wave sonic and density logs.\nThe results from the analysis showed that there is correlation between elastic strength and fracture\npressure.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "DORCAS S.
