{"Nomor": 43428, "Judul": "Thermal image processing for real-time non-contact respiration rate monitoring", "Abstrak": "A real-time thermal imaging based, non-contact respiration rate monitoring method was developed. It measured the respiration related skin surface temperature changes under the tip of the nose. Facial tracking was required as headmovements caused the face to appear in different locations in the recorded images over time. The algorithm detected the tip of the nose and then, a region just under it was selected. The pixel values in this region in successive images were processed to determine respiration rate. The segmentation method, used as part of the facial tracking, was evaluated on 55,000 thermal images recorded from 14 subjects with different extent of head movements. It separated the face from image background in all\nimages. However, in 11.7% of the images, a section of the neck was also included, but this did not cause an error in determining respiration rate. The method was further evaluated on 15 adults, against two contact respiration rate monitoring methods that tracked thoracic and abdominal movements. The three methods gave close respiration rates in 12 subjects but in 3 subjects, where there were very large head movements, the respiration rates did not match.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Abdulkadir H Alkali [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Reza Saatchi, Heather Elphick, Derek Burke"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "Circuits, Devices & Systems, IET", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2019"}
