{"Nomor": 46123, "Judul": "ENERGIES OF ADSORBED CATALYTIC INTERMEDIATES ON TRANSITION METAL SURFACES: CALORIMETRIC MEASUREMENTS AND BENCHMARKS FOR THEORY", "Abstrak": "Better catalysts and electrocatalysts are\nessential for the production and use of clean fuels with less\npollution and improved energy efficiency, for making\nchemicals with less energy and environmental impact, for\npollution abatement, and for many other future technologies\nneeded to achieve environmentally friendlier energy supply\nand chemicals industry. Crucial for rational design of better\ncatalyst and electrocatalyst materials is knowledge of the\nenergies of elementary chemical reactions on late transition\nmetal surfaces. This knowledge would also aid in designing\nmore efficient and stable photocatalysts and batteries for\nharvesting and storing solar energy.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Charles T.
