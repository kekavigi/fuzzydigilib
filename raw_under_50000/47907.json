{"Nomor": 47907, "Judul": "THE EFFECT OF ELECTRICAL STRESS, POLARITY REVERSAL, AND ELECTRO-THERMAL STRESS ON SPACE CHARGE BEHAVIOR IN HVDC MODEL CABLE", "Abstrak": "Transmission systems using HVDC become an attractive option for power industry players due to\ntheir efficiency and reliability compared to HVAC, especially for bulk power, lengthy, and / or\nsubmarine electric power transmissions. In the HVDC system, space charge is an interesting\nphenomenon to be investigated related to the electric field distortion and to the degradation of\ninsulation in the cable. Therefore, research on the charge space on the cable is essential to study.\nThis study aims to observe the behavior of space charge on HVDC miniature cable considering\nthe voltage level, polarity reversal, and electro-thermal stress.\nThe tested miniature cable (mini-cable), model of HVDC cables, is copper core conductor cable\nwith 3 mm-thick XLPE insulation with the semi conductive shield. The space charge\nmeasurements were achieved by the pulsed electro-acoustic (PEA) method. In order to contribute\nto the settlement of experimental means, we have investigated the effect of the experimental\narrangement on the quality of the electro acoustic signal that can be obtained.\nSeveral voltages both in positive and negative polarity are applied to the cable with levels up to 35\nkV. +35 kV and -35 kV are applied for observing space charges under-voltage polarity reversal.\nSome measurements were achieved under a thermal gradient of 7\u00b0C along the insulation of the\ncable. It was used to observe for the field redistribution and possible electro-thermal ageing effect\non the cable. Space charge is measured using the pulse electric acoustic (PEA) method.\nComparisons of the space charge patterns are performed. The effect of the electrical stress, polarity\nreversal, and electro-thermal stress on space charge behavior on XLPE insulation in HVDC\nminiature cables are obtained.", "Daftar File": {"Abstract": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/207481", "Tesis": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/210166"}, "Penulis": "Dhany Irvandy [23218065]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr.-Ing.
