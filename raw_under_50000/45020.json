The oil and gas industry requires rapid and reliable means of forecasting production.\nExisting traditional decline curve analysis (DCA) methods have been limited in their ability to satisfactorily\nforecast production from unconventional liquid-rich shale (LRS) reservoirs. This is due to several causes ranging\nfrom the complicated production mechanisms to the ultra-low permeability in shales. The use of hybrid (combination) DCA models can improve results. However, complexities associated with these techniques can still\nmake their application quite tedious without proper diagnostic plots, correct use of model parameters and some\nknowledge of the production mechanisms involved. This work, therefore, presents a new statistical data-driven\napproach of forecasting production from LRS reservoirs called the Principal Components Methodology (PCM).\nPCM is a technique that bypasses a lot of the difficulties associated with existing methods of forecasting and\nforecasts production with reasonable certainty. PCM is a data-driven method of forecasting based on the statistical technique of principal components analysis (PCA).\nIn our study, we simulated production of fluids with different compositions for 30 years with the aid of a\ncommercial compositional simulator. We then applied the Principal Components Methodology (PCM) to the\nproduction data from several representative wells by using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to calculate the\nprincipal components. These principal components were then used to forecast oil production from wells with\nproduction histories ranging from 0.5 to 3 years, and the results were compared to simulated data. Application of\nthe PCM to field data is also included in this work.\nThis study provides fresh initiatives into how production forecasting from unconventional LRS reservoirs can\nbe done in a different way.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "IBUKUN MAKINDE [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["W.
