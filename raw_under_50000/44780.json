{"Nomor": 44780, "Judul": "Solving Asphaltene Precipitation Issue In Vertical Wells Via Redesigning Of Production Facilities", "Abstrak": "Precipitation of heavy hydrocarbon components such as Wax and Asphaltenes are one of the most\nchallenging issues in oil production processes. The associated complications extend from the\nreservoir to refineries and petrochemical plants. Precipitation is most destructive when the affected\nareas are hard to reach, for example the wellbore of producing wells. This work demonstrates the\neffect of adjusting choke valve sizes on thermodynamic parameters of fluid flowing in a vertical\nwell. Our simulation results revealed optimum choke valve sizes that could keep producing vertical\nwells away from Asphaltene precipitation. The results of this study were implemented on a well in\nDarquin Reservoir that had been experiencing asphaltene precipitation. Experimental analysis of\nreservoir fluid, Asphaltene tests and thermodynamic simulations of well column were carried out\nand the most appropriate size of choke valve was determined. After replacing the well's original\nchoke valve with the suggested choke valve, the Asphaltene precipitation problem diminished", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MAHDI ZEINALI HASANVAND [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mohammad Ali Ahmadi", "Reza Mosayebi Behbahani"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Asphaltene precipitation, Vertical well, Choke valve, Thermodynamic parameters, Well column", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 2, Pages 139-145 (September  2015),  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.07.002", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "05 Nov 2019"}
