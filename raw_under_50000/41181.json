{"Nomor": 41181, "Judul": "STRESS-STRAIN STATE OF ELASTOPLASTIC BODIES WITHCRACK", "Abstrak": "A physical cut model is used to describe the changes in the stress-strain state (SSS)\nin elastoplastic bodies weakened by cracks. The distance between the crack edges is considered\nto be finite in contrast to the mathematical cut. The interactive layer with a thickness limited by\nthe possibility of using the hypothesis of continuity is distinguished on the physical cut extension.\nDistribution of stresses and strains over the layer thickness is constant and does not depend on the\ngeometry of the boundary between the cut and the interactive layer. The relationship between\nstresses and strains is determined by the deformation plasticity theory. The problem of plane\nstrain or plane stress state of an arbitrary finite body weakened by a physical cut is reduced to\nsolving a system of two variational equations for displacement fields in the body parts adjacent\nto the interactive layer. The proposed approach eliminates the singularity in stress distribution\nin contrast to the mathematical cut model. Use of local strength criteria allows us to determine\nthe time, point and direction of the fracture initiation. Possibilities of the proposed model are\nillustrated by solving the problems of determining the SSS of a rectangular body weakened by a\nphysical cut under symmetric and antisymmetric loadings.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "V .
