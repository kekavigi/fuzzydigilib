{"Nomor": 44019, "Judul": "RECONSTRUCTION OF BANDUNG LOCAL METEORIC WATERLINE FOR RECHARGE ANALYSIS BASED ON SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF STABLES ISOTOPES 18O AND 2 H", "Abstrak": "The Bandung groundwater basin topographic form can be considered as unique and has a big influence on the local meteorological parameters. The irregularity of rainfall frequently occurred at a local scale leading to the complex analysis of the groundwater recharge. this research applied Stables isotopes (18H and 2 H) Hydrogeochemistry approach to evaluate and determine the source of Local Meteoric Water Lines. the recharge area of the basin is located at the mountain formation of the northern and southern part. result of the analysis done in order to reconstruct he Local Meteoric Water Lines suggest that the Local met Local Meteoric Water for Line remain different and have their own condensation source. Meanwhile the condensation source of the southern part is not determined yet. The anomalies of isotope ratio composition in the south only are not enough to estimate the position of its condensation.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Ranaivo Andrianjafitoanina Hob": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184289"}, "Penulis": "Ranaivo Andrianjafitoanina Hob [22716701]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Rusmawan Suwarman, S.Si., M.T.", "Irwan Iskandar, S.T., M.T., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Air Tanah", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Ilmu dan Teknologi Kebumian", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Okt 2019"}
