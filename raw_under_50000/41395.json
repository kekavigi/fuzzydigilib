{"Nomor": 41395, "Judul": "2D-ERT monitoring of soil moisture seasonal behaviour in a river levee: A case study", "Abstrak": "We present a study of the seasonal behaviour of soil moisture in an old embankment levee by means of 2D DCelectrical\nresistivity tomography monitoring based on an embedded electrode installation.\nWewere able to produce seasonal resistivity changemodels that are compensated for temperature effects using a\nseasonal temperature profile model. Time-lapse sections of percentage resistivity changes showspatial and temporal\noverall consistency with seasonal variations of soil temperature. Discrepancies are likely due to the pavement\nlayer that is not well considered in the inversion process as well as to time-lapse inversion pitfalls.\nFurthermore, a detailed estimation of seasonal moisture content variations could not be given as an accurate calibration\nof the employed suction probes was not achievable.\nNevertheless, the levee appears to have spatially consistent time variations in soil moisture, clearly influenced by\nboth rainfall and water table and river levels. Future work on developing 3D acquisitions and adding embedded\nmoisture content probes should prove effective to our monitoring design and give a more detailed understanding\nof the soil moisture seasonal behaviour in the studied stretch of levee", "Daftar File": {"2019 EJRNL PP CLARA JODRY 1": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/178724"}, "Penulis": "Clara Jodry [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["S\u00e9rgio Palma Lopes, Yannick Fargier, Martin Sanchez, Philippe C\u00f4te"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Electrical Resistivity Tomography Monitoring Seasonal variations Soil moisture Temperature compensation Embankment levee", "Sumber": "Journal of Applied Geophysics 167 (2019) 140\u2013151, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2019.05.008", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Agu 2019"}
