The method used in\nthe manufacture of hydrophobic layer is electrochemical deposition and epoxy\nresin-silica coating. Experiment with electrochemical deposition method will use\ntwo types of etching substrate which are CH3COOH and HNO3 while on the\nother hand, the coating with epoxy resin will be using silica fume. Both methods\nuse the same substrate to lower the surface energy which is stearic acid. The\nresults of the samples was then characterized by Scanning Electron Microscope\n(SEM), Fourier Transfer Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and the measurement of\ncontact angle along the sliding angle. The best contact angle for the\nelectrochemical deposition method in stearic acid concentration of 20 mM for 4\nhours with CH3COOH as etching substrate obtained at 143.9\u00b0 whereas with\nHNO3 as etching substrate will obtain the contact angle at 145.0\u00b0. The best angle\nof contact with the epoxy resin-silica coating obtained at 152.9\u00b0 with stearic acid\nconcentration of 20 mM, 1.5 grams of silica fume, and 2 grams of epoxy-resin at a\ntemperature of 230 \u00b0C.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Albert Wilson [13312052]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
