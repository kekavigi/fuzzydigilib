{"Nomor": 46118, "Judul": "MOLECULAR CLUSTERS: NANOSCALE BUILDING BLOCKS FOR SOLID-STATE MATERIALS", "Abstrak": "The programmed assembly of nanoscale building blocks into\nmulticomponent hierarchical structures is a powerful strategy for the bottom-up\nconstruction of functional materials. To develop this concept, our team has\nexplored the use of molecular clusters as superatomic building blocks to fabricate\nnew classes of materials. The library of molecular clusters is rich with exciting\nproperties, including diverse functionalization, redox activity, and magnetic\nordering, so the resulting cluster-assembled solids, which we term superatomic\ncrystals (SACs), hold the promise of high tunability, atomic precision, and robust\narchitectures among a diverse range of other material properties.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Andrew Pinkard [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Anouck M.
