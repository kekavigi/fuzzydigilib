{"Nomor": 44144, "Judul": "EXPLORING AN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY WASTEWATER TREATMENT FOR BATIK COTTAGE INDUSTRY IN PEKALONGAN CITY: THE CASE OF OZONATION TREATMENT FOR DECOLORIZATION AND BIODEGRADABILITY ENHANCEMENT", "Abstrak": "Designating batik as an Indonesian Cultural Heritage in 2009 by UNESCO\nincreased the demand for batik in Indonesia. Consequently, Indonesia faces serious\nenvironmental problems caused by waste/wastewater generated from the batik\nindustry. Pekalongan City as one of the biggest batik producers in Central Java,\nIndonesia operates three batik biological treatment wastewater treatment plants\n(WWTPs). This research focused on investigate current situation and problems of\ntreatment then evaluated through the effluent quality index (EQI) and compared\nwith water quality class criteria which is stated by government of Indonesia.\nAlternative treatment using ozonation followed by aerobic biological treatment was\nalso conducted. The EQI indicates that the WWTPs effectively improved the water\nquality. The EQI scores of 3 WWTPs\u2019 effluent were comparable to the score of\nwater resource class II in Indonesia and Banyuurip Village WWPT which is using\nanaerobic treatment followed by constructed wetland was the most effective for\nbatik wastewater treatment. Alternative treatment systems combining\nphysicochemical processes and biological processes will be needed by local\ngovernment of Pekalongan city for the batik industry in future.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Ahsin Pramugani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184567", "BAB 1 Ahsin Pramugani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184573", "BAB 2 Ahsin Pramugani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184574", "BAB 3 Ahsin Pramugani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184575", "BAB 4 Ahsin Pramugani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184576", "BAB 5 Ahsin Pramugani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184577", "BAB 6 Ahsin Pramugani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184578", "DAFTAR Ahsin Pramugani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184579", "2019 TS PP AHSIN PRAMUGANI_LAMPIRAN.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184580", "2019 TS PP AHSIN PRAMUGANI_JURNAL.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184581"}, "Penulis": "Ahsin Pramugani [25417008]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
