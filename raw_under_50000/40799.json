The analysis procedure is based on nonlocal elasticity theory with surface\neffects. The nonlocal elasticity theory states that the stress at a point is a function of strains at\nall points in the continuum. This theory becomes significant for small-length scale objects such as\nmicro- and nanostructures. The effects of nonlocality, surface energy and axial force on the natural\nfrequencies of the nanotube are investigated. In this study, analytical solutions are formulated\nfor a clamped-free Euler-Bernoulli beam to study the free vibration of nanoscale tubes.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hossein Roostai [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mohammad Haghpanahi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "nonlocal elasticity theory, vibration, surface effects, nanoscale tube", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 27, No. 2, April, 2014", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Jul 2019"}
