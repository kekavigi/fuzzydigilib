{"Nomor": 44876, "Judul": "The Effect Of Natural Fracture On The Fluid Leak-Off In Hydraulic Fracturing Treatment", "Abstrak": "Fluid leak-off phenomenon plays a critical role in hydraulic fracturing operation. This phenomenon can\nbe very impressive in successful operation of hydraulic fracturing. This operation is very complex in\nfractured reservoirs due to the reaction between induced fracture and natural fractures. In this study\nwith the cohesive element method, the effect of presence of natural fracture on the magnitude of hydraulic fracturing fluid leak-off is investigated. First of all, cohesive element and extended finite element\nmethod methods are described. The fluid flow inside hydraulic fracture and the affecting parameters on\nleak-off of this fluid on adjacent environment are analyzed. Then, effects of natural fracture on hydraulic\nfracturing direction such as deviation, leak-off and the mutual influences (which includes the changes of\nstress regime around the natural fracture) and also changes in pore pressure are processed. The results\nindicate that presence of natural fracture will cause reduction in aperture of hydraulic fracture. This\ndecrease will lead to extension of fluid lag and eventually delaying of leak-off phenomenon. However,\nthis effect is negligible against the positive impact due to shear and normal displacement on increasing\nleak-off", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "AMIR GHADERI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jaber Taheri-Shakib", "Mohamad Amin Sharifnik"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Hydraulic fracturing, Natural fracture, Leak-off, Interaction, XFEM", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 5, Issue 1, Pages 85-89 (March  2019), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.05.006", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Nov 2019"}
