{"Nomor": 47404, "Judul": "2D INCOMPRESSIBLE FLOW SOLVER IN VELOCITY-VORTICITY FORMULATION USING DC-PSE OPERATOR DISCRETIZATION", "Abstrak": "In the field of engineering, many applications involve complex geometries. Classical\nfluid flow simulations of these problems often require difficult and time consuming\nmesh generation. Meshless methods come with the hope to overcome the\nlimitation by eliminating the mesh altogether by using a set of particles arbitrarily\ndistributed in the domain without any interconnectivity. Among meshless methods,\nDC PSE (Discretization Corrected Particle Strength Exchange) is one which\nis found to be numerically robust, especially for irregular node configurations.\nIn this work, fully meshless 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes solver is developed\nusing DC PSE operator discretization. The Steady Navier-Stokes equations are\nrepresented in velocity-vorticity formulation. Iterative velocity correction scheme\nis employed to ensure continuity equation of the velocity field. Two well-known\nand established benchmark problems, the lid driven cavity flow and the flow over\na backward-facing step are tested in order to evaluate the accuracy of the solver.\nIn addition, the solution of a flow over a cylinder in a rectangular channel is\nalso presented. The results demonstrate that the developed solver produces wellcomparable\nresult with the widely accepted literatures.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Tobias Samuel Sugandi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/206630", "BAB 1 Tobias Samuel Sugandi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/206631", "BAB 5 Tobias Samuel Sugandi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/206635", "PUSTAKA Tobias Samuel Sugandi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/206636"}, "Penulis": "Tobias Samuel Sugandi [13615042]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Lavi Rizki Zuhal"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "2D Incompressible Navier-Stokes, DC PSE, meshless methods, velocityvorticity formulation, velocity correction method.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Apr 2020"}
