In this study, a questionnaire\nwas used to find the important situations in which English is used in business communication.\nFor this purpose, Thai businesses were requested to provide samples of written\nbusiness correspondencedmostly e-mails in English. These e-mails were examined using\ngenre analysis to identify typical moves and steps in order to understand the use of English\nat the linguistic and discourse levels. Genre can be defined as a class of communicative\nevents, with the members sharing some set of communicative purposes. Interviews were\nalso conducted to gather data in order to describe in-depth, the nature of English language\ncommunication and possible problems arising in a Thai business context. The findings\nshowed that despite a large number of errors in usage in the English samples, they rarely\ncaused problems with the running of the business as Thai communicators employed a\nmove/step structure in their e-mails and other communications strategies including\nfollow-up inquiries for clarification. Pedagogical implications are discussed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Kulaporn Hiranburana [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "business English, business English communication, English in the workplace", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect,", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Agu 2019"}
