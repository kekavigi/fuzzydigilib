{"Nomor": 46102, "Judul": "TRIALKYLSILYL-SUBSTITUTED SILOLE AND GERMOLE DIANIONS AS PRECURSORS FOR UNUSUAL SILICON AND GERMANIUM COMPOUNDS", "Abstrak": "Group 14 element heteroles are the heavier analogues of cyclopentadienes in\nwhich a heavier group 14 element atom replaces the sp3 carbon atom. In particular siloles and,\nto a somewhat smaller degree, germoles attracted considerable attention since the early 1990s\ndue to their favorable photophysical properties which allowed the construction of OLEDs\nusing group 14 element heteroles as emissive or electron-transport layers.\nAnions and in particular dianions derived from group 14 element heteroles have been of\nsubstantial interest due to the possible occurrence of Hu?ckel aromaticity involving the heavier\nmain group atom. Aromaticity is not the only notable electronic feature of silole and germole\ndianions; the spatial and energetic alignment of their frontier orbitals is equally remarkable.\nWith a high lying lone pair at the heteroatom, which is orthogonal to a delocalized ?-system,\ntheir frontier orbital sequence closely resembles that of N-heterocyclic carbene analogues.\nDespite these intriguing parallels between carbene analogues and silole and germole dianions,\ndisappointingly little is known about their reactivity.
