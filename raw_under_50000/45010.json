{"Nomor": 45010, "Judul": "Coriolis force-driven instabilities in stratified miscible layers on a rotationally actuated microfluidic platform", "Abstrak": "Stability analysis of stratified multiphase flow for a spanwise system of rotation plays\na pivotal role in micromixing and micromachines. In several such systems, centrifugal\nactuation is the driving force, which creates a pressure gradient in a rotating channel and\nCoriolis force enhances mixing in a short span by destabilizing the flow. Here, we focus\non the impact of the Coriolis force on a rotating two-fluid flow through a microchannel,\nwhich is miscible in nature, having small viscosity difference and thereby forming a thin\ndiffusive interface between fluids due to viscosity stratification. Modal stability analysis is\nused to estimate the critical flow parameters which are, in turn, responsible for regulating\nthe instability mechanism for different viscosity contrasts and mixed layer thicknesses.\nUsually, viscosity stratified flow with respect to streamwise disturbance becomes more\nunstable for a thinner mixed layer. On the contrary, our numerical computation confirms\na completely discrepant scenario by considering Coriolis force-driven instability of a\nmiscible flow system on account of spanwise disturbances. Possible physical mechanisms\nfor the same are discussed in terms of base flow pattern and the energy fluctuation between\nthe perturbed and base flow. Comparison of three-dimensional disturbances of the flow\nfield, in both clockwise and anticlockwise directions (for two different viscosity ratios),\nis executed to provide an insight into the dynamics of the flow system. Distributions of\nthe velocity perturbations display a critical bonding between the vortices near and away\nfrom the mixed layer. These vortices are, in turn, responsible for the variation in instability\nmechanism with respect to different viscosity ratios and rotational directions.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Saunak Sengupta [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sukhendu Ghosh , Sandeep Saha, and Suman Chakraborty"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS 4, 113902 (2019), APS", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Nov 2019"}
