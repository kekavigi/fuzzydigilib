{"Nomor": 44971, "Judul": "Topological cathodes: Controlling the space charge limit of electron emission using metamaterials", "Abstrak": "The space charge limit (SCL) of emission from photocathodes sets an upper limit on the performance of\nboth high- and low-field electron guns. Generally, one is forced to strike a compromise between the space charge limit and the cathode\u2019s intrinsic emittance [I. Bazarov et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 104801 (2009)]. However, it is possible to nearly eliminate the SCL due to the image charge by engineering the topography of the cathode\u2019s surface. A cathode with a surface plasma frequency below the frequency spectrum of the accelerating electrons will greatly reduce the polarization of the cathode and its image-charge field, thereby mitigating the cathode\u2019s space charge limit for photoelectric, thermionic, and field emission. In the work presented here, a theory for the image-charge field of a disk of charge being accelerated from the cathode surface is developed which includes the frequency-dependent effects of the cathode\u2019s dielectric function. This theory verifies the concept of SCL mitigation with a wire array metamaterial to design a metacathode with greatly reduced image-charge fields. The details of the holistic metacathode design spanning 6 orders of magnitude in scale are described.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "David H.
