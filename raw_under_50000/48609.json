{"Nomor": 48609, "Judul": "HIDROLISIS ENZIMATIK PALM STEARIN SEBAGAI BAHAN BAKU KOMPONEN ADITIF PANGAN", "Abstrak": "Indonesia is one of the largest palm oil producers in the world. In its processing, palm oil fractionation (CPO) produces liquid fraction (olein) and solid fraction (stearin). Palm stearin content from CPO is around 21%, far less than olein (73%). Its low levels and high melting point cause palm stearin to be not fully utilized. Palm stearin can be hydrolyzed to produce free fatty acids for further utilization. Enzyme catalysts in hydrolysis are used because they can be carried out at low temperatures and do not produce side products. This study aims to determine the effect of enzyme concentration and the addition of organic solvents to the levels of free fatty acids produced. The lipase used is derived from Candida rugosa (triacylglycerol hydrolase, EC.3.1.1.3).\nThe results showed an increase in enzyme concentration could increase the degree of hydrolysis of stearin to free fatty acids. Higher enzyme concentrations will increase reaction rates because more active sides can interact with the substrate. The highest degree of hydrolysis is obtained at a concentration of 2,5% (% -b/b) stated in terms of acid numbers, free fatty acid levels, and degrees of hydrolysis, respectively at 103,5 mg KOH/g stearin, 47,35 % and 52,13%. The addition of hexane and isooctane organic solvents can increase the degree of hydrolysis of palm stearin to free fatty acids where non-polar organic solvents can help increase substrate solubility and also help to open the enzyme lid so that the active side can more easily reach its active state. The highest results obtained were experiments using isooctane stated in the form of acid numbers, free fatty acid levels, and degrees of hydrolysis respectively of 86,32 mg KOH / g stearin, 39,46%, and 42,94%.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Putri Nurul Hikmah [14316023]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ardiyan Harimawan, S.T., M.Eng.", "Dr. Dianika Lestari, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Pangan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknologi Industri", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Candida rugosa, fatty acid, hydrolysis, lipase, stearin", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Jun 2020"}
