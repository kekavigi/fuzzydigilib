{"Nomor": 42721, "Judul": "Low-resolution face alignment and recognition using mixed-resolution classifiers", "Abstrak": "A very common case for law enforcement is recognition of suspects from a long distance or in a crowd. This is an important application for low-resolution face recognition (in the authors' case, face region below 40 \u00d7 40 pixels in size). Normally, high-resolution images of the suspects are used as references, which will lead to a resolution mismatch of the target and reference images since the target images are usually taken at a long distance and are of low resolution. Most existing methods that are designed to match high-resolution images cannot handle low-resolution probes well. In this study, they propose a novel method especially designed to compare low-resolution images with high-resolution ones, which is based on the log-likelihood\nratio (LLR). In addition, they demonstrate the difference in recognition performance between real low-resolution images and images down-sampled from high-resolution ones. Misalignment is one of the most important issues in low-resolution face recognition. Two approaches \u2013 matching-score-based registration and extended training of images with various alignments \u2013 are introduced to handle the alignment problem. Their experiments on real low-resolution face databases show that their methods outperform the state-of-the-art.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yuxi Peng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Luuk Spreeuwers, Raymond Veldhuis"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "mixed-resolution classifiers", "Sumber": "IET Biometrics", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Sep 2019"}
