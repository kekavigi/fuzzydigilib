This condition will activate cathepsin L as well as inflammation happened. Cathepsin L is\none of the therapeutic target for antiaging that is still developed until now. Three types of plants named\ntahongai (Kleinhovia hospita), kemiri (Aleurites moluccana), and pegagan (Centella asiatica) are known\nempiritically in Indonesia as anti-inflammatory drug. The aims of this study were to predict the activities\nof 31 compounds from tahongai, kemiri, and pegagan as cathepsin L inhibitor and their toxicity level.\nThese 31 compounds were optimized geometrically using Chimera 1.13.1rc and ChemBio 3D Ultra 12.0.\nMolecular docking interaction was performed using Autodock 4.2.6. on the other hand, molecular\ndynamic interaction was generated using Amber 18. Furthermore, the interaction analysis were obtained\nfrom Ligand Scout 4.2.1 and Biovia Discovery Studio 2017. The toxicity test was performed using ADMET\nPredictor 7.1. Based on molecular docking and molecular dynamic results????\u00ff?\u00b1\u00f0?\u00ed?????????\u00f0????\u00f0?\u00b1 !????????-Amyrin, and\ncastiliferol gave the lower binding free energy than schinol as positive control (-27.0925, -28.6813, dan -\n26.0037 kcal/mol) and also had interaction with TRP 193, TRP 189, and GLN 19 o?????\u00ed\u00b1\u00f0????????????????\u00b1\u00e3\u00f0??\u00a2\u00f0?\u00ad\u00f0?\u00e3\nsite which near to triad catalytic residues. Toxicity test was done towards these compounds which\nincluded sensitization test, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and environmental toxicity. In conclusion????????-\nAmyrin is the most potential candidate since it gave low binding energy and also had high safety level.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Nabilla Rizkia Fabelle": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/204026"}, "Penulis": "Nabilla Rizkia Fabelle [10715054]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. rer. nat.
