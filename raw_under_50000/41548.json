{"Nomor": 41548, "Judul": "Pre-service English teachers' attitudes towards English as a lingua franca", "Abstrak": "This study investigated the attitudes pre-service English teachersdEnglish majors, students minoring in\nEnglish, graduate students, and internsdhave towards English as a lingua franca. Results showed differences\nconcerning the native speaker of English as a role model and the importance of exposure to a\nvariety of Englishes. Interns and English majors expressed higher expectations for attaining native-like\nproficiency; English minors showed less reliance on a native-speaker model. To help future educators\ndevelop greater awareness of the role of English in today's world, teacher preparation programs in\nsettings where English is a foreign language should reflect a global Englishes perspective.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jean E.
