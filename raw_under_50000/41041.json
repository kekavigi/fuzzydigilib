{"Nomor": 41041, "Judul": "Evidence for Vortex Shedding in the Sun\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds Hot Corona", "Abstrak": "Vortex shedding is an oscillating flow that is commonly observed in fluids due to the presence of a blunt\nbody in a flowing medium. Numerical simulations have shown that the phenomenon of vortex shedding\ncould also develop in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) domain. The dimensionless Strouhal number, the\nratio of the blunt body diameter to the product of the period of vortex shedding and the speed of a flowing medium, is a robust indicator for vortex shedding, and, generally of the order of 0.2 for a wide range of Reynolds number. Using an observation from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we report a wavelike or oscillating plasma flow propagating upward against the Sun\u2019s gravitational force. A newly formed shrinking loop in the postflare region possibly generates the\noscillation of the upflow in the wake of the hot and dense loop through vortex shedding. The computed\nStrouhal number is consistent with the prediction from previous MHD simulations. Our observation\nsuggests the possibility of vortex shedding in the solar corona.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Tanmoy Samanta [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hui Tian,", "and Valery M.
