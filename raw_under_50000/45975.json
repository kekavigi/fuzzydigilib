{"Nomor": 45975, "Judul": "Feeding of particle-based materials in continuous solid dosage manufacturing: a material science perspective", "Abstrak": "Based on the demands of an increasingly diverse patient population\nand the requirement for a robust manufacturing supply chain\nto combat drug shortages, pharmaceutical product manufacturing\nis now advancing toward efficient, flexible and continuous processing\n[1]. This has increased the need for in-depth knowledge of\nthe relevant material properties in terms of manufacturability and\nprocess understanding. The material science tetrahedron (MST),\nthe manufacturability classification system (MCS) and material\ndatabase approaches are some preliminary concepts and initiatives...", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Wen-Kai Hsiao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Theresa R.
