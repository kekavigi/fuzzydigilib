{"Nomor": 44710, "Judul": "Trip misreporting forecast using count data model in a GPS enhanced travel survey", "Abstrak": "As Global Positioning System (GPS) technology advances, it has been\nincreasingly used to supplement traditional self-reported travel surveys due to its promising\nfeatures in capturing travel data with better accuracy and reliability. Realizing the limitations of diary-based surveys, this paper presents a study that directly accounts for trip\nmisreporting behavior in trip generation models. Travel data were obtained from prompted-recall assisted GPS survey along with a diary-based survey. Negative Binomial models\nfor count data were developed to accommodate misreporting behavior by introducing\ninteraction effects of the sample-indicator variable with various personal and household\nvariables. The interaction effects indicate how the impacts of the socioeconomic and\ndemographic variables on trip-making vary across the two samples. Assuming that the GPS\nsample represents the ground truth, the interaction effects actually capture the likelihood\nand the extent of trip misreporting by detailed personal and household characteristics. The\nmodel results reveal significant interaction effects of several personal and household\nvariables, indicating misreporting behavior associated with these attributes. The addition of\ninteraction coefficients to the main effect model represents the real impacts of the independent variables, after compensating for trip misreporting behavior, if any", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Md.
