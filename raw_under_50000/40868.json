{"Nomor": 40868, "Judul": "Limits of Chromosome Compaction by Loop-Extruding Motors", "Abstrak": "During mitosis, human chromosomes are linearly compacted about 1000-fold by loop-extruding\nmotors. Recent experiments have shown that condensins extrude DNA loops but in a \u201cone-sided\u201d\nmanner. This contrasts with existing models, which predict that symmetric, \u201ctwo-sided\u201d loop extrusion\naccounts for mitotic chromosome compaction. We explore whether one-sided extrusion, as it is\ncurrently seen in experiments, can compact chromosomes by developing a mean-field theoretical\nmodel for polymer compaction by motors that actively extrude loops and dynamically turnover. The\nmodel establishes a stringent upper bound of only about tenfold for compaction by strictly one-sided\nextrusion. We confirm this result with stochastic simulations. Thus, strictly one-sided extrusion as it\nhas been observed so far cannot be the sole mechanism of chromosome compaction. However, as\nshown by the model, other two-sided or effectively two-sided mechanisms can achieve sufficient\ncompaction.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Edward J.
