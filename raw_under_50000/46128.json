{"Nomor": 46128, "Judul": "DESIGN PRINCIPLES, SENSING MECHANISMS, AND APPLICATIONS OF HIGHLY SPECIFIC FLUORESCENT PROBES FOR HOCL/OCL", "Abstrak": "Hypochlorous acid/hypochlorite (HOCl/\nOCl?), one of the most important reactive oxygen species\n(ROS), plays vital roles in various physiological and pathological\nprocesses. At normal concentrations, OCl? acts as part of an\nimmune defense system by destroying invasive bacteria and\npathogens. However, nonproperly located or excessive amounts of\nOCl? are related to many diseases, including cancers. Thus,\ndetection of OCl? has great importance. Owing to their high\nsensitivities, selectivities, fast response times, technical simplicities,\nand high temporal and spatial resolution, fluorescent probes\nare powerful tools for in vitro and in vivo sensing of target\nsubstances. This Account focuses on the development of new\nchemosensors for detection of OCl?, which operate by undergoing\na chemical reaction with this ROS in conjunction with a change in emission properties.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Di Wu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Liyan Chen,Qingling Xu, Xiaoqiang Chen, Juyoung Yoon"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Design Principles, Sensing Mechanisms, Applications of Highly Specific Fluorescent Probes for HOCl/OCl", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Feb 2020"}
