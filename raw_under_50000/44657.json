{"Nomor": 44657, "Judul": "Research Strategies on New Prefabricated Technology for Underground Metro Stations", "Abstrak": "Based on the first successful application of new\nprefabricated technology in underground metro stations on\nline 2 of the Changchun Metro in China, a comprehensive\nanalysis and discussion on research strategies for new\nprefabricated technology for large underground structures\nis provided. This paper introduces the application status of\nprefabricated technology in underground engineering\nworldwide, illustrates the different characteristics of prefabricated technology applied to ground buildings and\nunderground structures, puts forward the key technologies,\nand compares the major technical, economic, and social\nbenefits achieved. The successful application of prefabricated technology for underground structures in Changchun\nMetro demonstrates the feasibility and great advantages of\nthe new prefabricated technology for underground\nengineering.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xiuren Yang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Meiqun Huang1  \u2022 Fang Lin"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering of railroads & roads", "Kata Kunci": "Metro station  Prefabricated technology Monolithic precast concrete structure  Superimposed prefabricated integral structure  Fully prefabricated structure  Rebar splicing by grout-filled coupling sleeve Grouted mortise\u2013tenon joint  Closed-cavity thin-walled components", "Sumber": "Urban Rail Transit (2019) 5(3):145\u2013154", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Okt 2019"}
