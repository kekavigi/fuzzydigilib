{"Nomor": 41574, "Judul": "Eggshell membrane: Review and impact on engineering", "Abstrak": "Agricultural bioresources are being recognised as emerging functional platforms that can\nfind application in biological, environmental, and agricultural engineering. Eggshell\nmembrane (ESM), the protein-rich membrane between the eggshell and egg white, has\nusually been regarded as waste and overlooked. However, its potential is now being\nhighlighted in many engineering fields. This review provides basic information about ESM\nstarting with its structural, chemical, and physical properties, and expands on its role in\nengineering fields. It touches upon various fabrication methods for constructing compatible\nESM-based functional platforms. The review focuses on the role and performance of\nESM in engineering applications: electric devices, sensors, environmental engineering,\nbiomedical engineering, and commercialization. Finally, new perspectives about the potential\nof ESM as a highly valuable bioresource in various engineering fields are discussed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Sunho Park [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Kyoung Soon Choi, Dohyeon Lee"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Eggshell membrane, Functional platforms, Agricultural engineering, Biological engineering, Environmental engineering", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect,", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Agu 2019"}
