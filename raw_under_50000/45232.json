{"Nomor": 45232, "Judul": "Electronic Properties of ?-RuCl3 in Proximity to Graphene", "Abstrak": "In the pursuit of developing routes to enhance magnetic Kitaev interactions in ?-RuCl3, as well as\nprobing doping effects, we investigate the electronic properties of ?-RuCl3 in proximity to graphene. We\nstudy ?-RuCl3/graphene heterostructures via ab initio density functional theory calculations, Wannier\nprojection, and nonperturbative exact diagonalization methods. We show that ?-RuCl3 becomes strained\nwhen placed on graphene and charge transfer occurs between the two layers, making ?-RuCl3 (graphene) lightly electron doped (hole doped). This gives rise to an insulator-to-metal transition in ?-RuCl3 with the Fermi energy located close to the bottom of the upper Hubbard band of the t2g manifold. These results suggest the possibility of realizing metallic and even exotic superconducting states. Moreover, we show that in the strained ?-RuCl3 monolayer the Kitaev interactions are enhanced by more than 50% compared to the unstrained bulk structure. Finally, we discuss scenarios related to transport experiments in ?-RuCl3/graphene heterostructures.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Sananda Biswa [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ying Li, Stephen M.
