The results show\nthat the present method is an effective and exact numerical one for solving the thermoelastic cou-\npling problem and is capable of overcoming the defects of traditional integrated transformation\nand inverse integrated transformation methods. At the same time, the temperature step of the\nthermal wave front is obtained exactly in contrast with conventional numerical transformation\nmethods.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ronghou Xi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiaogeng Tian, Yapeng Shen2"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "thermal relaxation time, generalized thermoelasticity theory, thermoelastic cou- pling, finite element method, time domain", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 27, No. 3, June, 2014", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Jul 2019"}
