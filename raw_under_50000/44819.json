Research results include the\nfollowing: According to lithofacies features and their association, the rudist-mound and tidal flat\nare the main microfacies in the Sar-3 depositional time. By investigating the regional tectonic\nsetting and seismic interpretation, a depositional model was built for the Sar-3 zone, which\nhighlights four key points: 1) The distribution of the rudist-buildup is controlled by the paleo-high.\n2) The build-up outside of the wide colonize stage but reached the wave-base level in a short time\nby regression and formation uplift, and was destroyed by the high energy current, then forming the\nmoundy allochthonous deposition after being dispersed and redeposited. 3) The tidal flat develops\nwidely in the upper Sar-3, and the deposition thickness depends on the paleo-structure. The tidal\nchannel develops in the valley and fringe of the Paleo-structure. 4) The exposure within the\nleaching effect by the meteoric water of the top of Sar-3 is the main controlling factor of the\nreservoir vertical architecture. The Sar-3 zone featured as the dualistic architecture consists of two\nregions: the lower is the rudist reef limestone reservoir and the upper is the tidal condense\nlimestone interlayer. The thickness of each is controlled by the paleo-structure. The Paleo-high zone\nis the preferential development zone. Based on reservoir characteristics of the different zones, a\ntargeted development strategy has been proposed. Keeping the trajectory in the middle of the oillayer in the paleo-high, and in the paleo-low, make the trajectory crossing the oil-zone and then\nkeep it in the lower", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "YANG DU [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jin-liang Zhang", "Shu-fen Zheng", "Jun Xin", "Jie Chen", "Yi-Zhen Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Iran, Southwest, Iran, Sarvak, Lithology facies, Depositional model, Reservoir architecture, Development strategy", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 1, Pages 16-26 (March  2015),    http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.04.001", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Nov 2019"}
