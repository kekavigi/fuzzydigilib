{"Nomor": 46070, "Judul": "COPPER(I)-CATALYZED ASYMMETRIC REACTIONS INVOLVING RADICALS", "Abstrak": "Asymmetric functionalization of alkyl radicals represents a robust yet\nunderdeveloped method for efficient construction and decoration of carbon skeletons in\nchiral organic molecules. In this field, we have been inspired by the excellent redox, alkyl\nradical trapping, and Lewis acidic properties of copper to develop several catalytic modes for\nasymmetric reactions involving alkyl radicals. At the beginning, we discovered tandem\nradical hydrotrifluoromethylation of unactivated alkenes and enantioselective alkoxylation of\nremote ....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Qiang-Shuai Gu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zhong-Liang Li and Xin-Yuan Liu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Catalyzed Asymmetric Reactions", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Feb 2020"}
