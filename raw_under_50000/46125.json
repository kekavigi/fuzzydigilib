{"Nomor": 46125, "Judul": "ACTIVITY-BASED SENSING AND THERANOSTIC PROBES BASED ON PHOTOINDUCED ELECTRON TRANSFER", "Abstrak": "Fluorescent probes have become powerful tools in detection,\nimaging and disease diagnosis due to their high sensitivity, specificity, fast\nresponse, and technical simplicity. In the last decades, researchers have made\nremarkable progress in developing signaling mechanisms to design fluorescent\nprobes such as photoinduced electron transfer (PET), intramolecular charge\ntransfer (ICT), and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Typical\nPET is composed of a multicomponent system in which a fluorophore\n(electron acceptor) is separately linked with a recognition group (electron\ndonor) via a short spacer. PET probes normally feature a low fluorescence\nbackground and significant fluorescence enhancement in response to targets.\nRecent research revealed that PET probes have also been used as theranostic\nagents, whose fluorescence and toxicity can be simultaneously activated by\ncancer-specific parameters.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Wen Sun [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Miao Li, Jiangli Fan, Xiaojun Peng"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Activity-Based Sensing, Theranostic Probes Based, Photoinduced Electron Transfer", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Feb 2020"}
