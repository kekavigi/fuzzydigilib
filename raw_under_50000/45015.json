{"Nomor": 45015, "Judul": "Influence Of Oil Viscosity On Oil-Water Core-Annular Flow Through A Horizontal Pipe", "Abstrak": "An experimental study has been made of oil-water core-annular flow in a horizontal pipe with special\nattention for the influence of the oil viscosity on the pressure drop. For that purpose a heating system has\nbeen installed and configured that is able to control the oil temperature, such that the oil viscosity could\nbe varied between 3000 cSt at 20 C and 400 cSt at 50 C. The oil flow rate was kept at a constant value of\n0.35 l/s, whereas the watercut was varied between 9% and 25%. The measured pressure drop is scaled\nwith the calculated pressure drop of only oil flowing at the same flow rate and viscosity.\nThe main conclusion is that for a large oil viscosity the scaled pressure drop is almost independent of\nthe watercut, whereas with decreasing viscosity the scaled pressure drop becomes strongly dependent\non the watercut. Visualisation of the oil-water interface shows a more irregular wave shape with smaller\nwave lengths when the viscosity is decreased. There is very good agreement between the predictions of\nthe model of Ullmann & Brauner for the scaled pressure drop and the measurements.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ERIK VAN DUIN [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ruud Henkes", "Gijs Ooms"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "Oil,  water core, pipe, Annular Flow Through", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 5, Issue 2, Pages 199-205 (June  2019), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.01.003", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Nov 2019"}
