{"Nomor": 44679, "Judul": "Smart Urban Transit Systems: From Integrated Framework to Interdisciplinary Perspective", "Abstrak": "Urban transit system is an important part of\ncity transportation, which is an interdisciplinary industry,\nincluding traffic engineering, operation research, and\ncomputer science. To provide smart services for passengers while applying the new technologies, it is necessary to\nbuild an optimal transit network and transit service. A\nsmart transit system is processed from strategic planning,\ntactical planning, operational planning, transit evaluation to marketing and policy. For each stage, large quantities of related literature have been introduced from\ndifferent perspectives. The aim of this research is to document the main smart urban transit models, topics and\nimplementations for future references and research in each\nstage. For the planning part, this paper first summarized the\nobjectives, constraints, algorithms, and implications of\nthe models currently in use and classified the objectives\nand constraints with classic category and new category.\nThe prominent topics and potential research were captured\nclearly when comparing the two categories. The methodologies for solving those models were proposed and the\ngenetic algorithm and simulated annealing have been\nmostly used, which will be helpful for filling the gaps for\nfurther research. Despite of the model updates, this study\nalso summarized the application trends such as integrated\nnetwork design in strategic planning, synchronization and\ntimetable recovery from disruption in tactical and operational planning. To improve the transit system and service,\nevaluation models on service reliability, service accessibility, timetable robustness, and energy consuming are\nproposed, which highlight the gap between the idealized\nservice and the real service. Some flexible fare scheme,\ninvestments, and commercial strategies are discussed in the\nfinancial part. The conclusion highlighted the future scope\nof the smart urban transit in passenger demand management, travel information service, facility and service optimization and shared mobility, in order to make it more\nconvenient for the passengers and more friendly to the\nenvironment.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Kai Lu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["\u2022 Baoming Han   \u2022 Xuesong Zhou"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering of railroads & roads", "Kata Kunci": "Smart urban transit  Network design Operation and service  Evaluation  Control  Marketing", "Sumber": "Urban Rail Transit (2018) 4(2):49\u201367", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Okt 2019"}
