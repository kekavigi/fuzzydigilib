In this study the active diazotrophic community was investigated in\nthe three treatments of mowed, grazed and enclosed Leymus chinensis steppes in Hulunbeier grassland\nof Inner Mongolia by using approaches of polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis\n(PCR\u2013DGGE) and sequence analysis. The community structure and diversity of the bacterial groups\nfrom the different samples was further analyzed by using different techniques, such as statistical analysis\nand diversity index evaluation of the band patterns etc. The results showed that grazing activity significantly\nreduced the number of species and quantities of nitrogen-fixing microorganisms, as well as the\nnifH gene diversity.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zou Yukun [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zhang Jingni, Yang Dianlin, Chen Xiurong, Zhao Jianning, Xiu Weiming, Lai Xin, Li Gang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Leymus chinensis steppe, nifH, Biodiversity, Phylogenetic analysis", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Jul 2019"}
