Wave attenuation\nis a term that refers to the reduction of wave energy as the effect of scattering and\nabsorbing. First, the one-dimensional (1-D) and two-dimensional (2-D)\nmathematical model that represents the wave propagation phenomenon passing\nthrough porous media is governed using Shallow Water Equations (SWEs).\nSecondly, some modifications towards the SWEs will be applied in order to capture\nthe wave attenuation caused by porous media. The modifications are by adding\nfriction and diffusion factor into the SWEs. Afterwards, the 1-D model will be\nsolved analytically using the characteristics method and numerically using the finite\nvolume method on a staggered grid scheme. Moreover, numerical observation of\nthe wave propagation phenomenon will be conducted on a real bathymetry profile.\nThe 2-D SWEs is discretized using the Arakawa Staggered C-Grid. In this 2-D\nmodel, wave shoaling phenomenon is taken into account. Wave shoaling is the\nchange in water height as the effect of change in water depth. Next, the robustness\nof the 1-D numerical scheme is validated by its convergence to the analytical\nsolution by means of the transmission coefficient. The transmission coefficient\nrepresents the wave amplitude reduction caused by the porous media. The results\nshow that the friction coefficient, diffusion coefficient, and vegetation length have\na significant effect upon the transmission coefficient.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK VIVIANNE.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/232402"}, "Penulis": "Vivianne [10116052]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ikha Magdalena, S.Si., M.Si."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Matematika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Shallow Water Equations, reduction, friction, diffusion, transmission coefficient, bathymetry profile", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Dwi Ary Fuziastuti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "16 Sep 2020"}
