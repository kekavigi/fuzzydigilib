{"Nomor": 46076, "Judul": "ANODIC OXIDATION FOR THE STEREOSELECTIVE SYNTHESIS OF HETEROCYCLES", "Abstrak": "Stereodefined aliphatic heterocycles are one of\nthe fundamental structural motifs observed in natural products and\nbiologically active compounds. Various strategies for the synthesis\nof these building blocks based on transition metal catalysis,\norganocatalysis, and noncatalytic conditions have been developed.\nAlthough electrosynthesis has also been utilized for the functionalization\nof aliphatic heterocycles, stereoselective transformations\nunder electrochemical conditions are still a challenging field in\nelectroorganic chemistry....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Kosuke Yamamoto [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Masami Kuriyama, Osamu Onomura"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Anodic Oxidation, Stereoselective Synthesis, Heterocycles", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Feb 2020"}
