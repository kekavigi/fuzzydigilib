{"Nomor": 41512, "Judul": "Automatic landing system design via multivariable model reference adaptive control", "Abstrak": "The landing of a civil transport aircraft is one of the most critical phases due to parametric uncertainties and strong crosswind conditions. In this paper, separate controllers are designed for longitudinal and lateral-directional channels for the landing phase, which is divided into the final approach, flare, and decrab. A multivariable model reference adaptive control scheme is implemented with state feedback for output tracking. The safety and flight performance of the autolanding control system are demonstrated through Monte Carlo simulations of a nonlinear civil transport aircraft model.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yawen Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Qifu Li, Bei Lu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Other branches of engineering", "Kata Kunci": "Civil transport aircraft,  Autolanding design,  Adaptive control, Output tracking,  Monte Carlo simulations", "Sumber": "Aerospace Systems  June 2018, Volume 1, Issue 1, pp 63\u201371", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Agu 2019"}
