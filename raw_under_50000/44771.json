{"Nomor": 44771, "Judul": "Nanorheology of Interfacial Water during Ice Gliding", "Abstrak": "The slipperiness of ice is an everyday-life phenomenon, which, surprisingly, remains controversial\ndespite a long scientific history. The very small friction measured on ice is classically attributed to\nthe presence of a thin self-lubricating film of meltwater between the slider and the ice. But while the\nmacroscale friction behavior of ice and snow has been widely investigated, very little is known about the\ninterfacial water film and its mechanical properties. In this work, we develop a stroke-probe force\nmeasurement technique to uncover the microscopic mechanisms underlying ice lubrication. We simultaneously measure the shear friction of a bead on ice and quantify the in situ mechanical properties of the interfacial film, as well as its thickness, under various regimes of speed and temperature. In contrast with standard views, meltwater is found to exhibit a complex viscoelastic rheology, with a viscosity up to 2 orders of magnitude larger than pristine water. The unconventional rheology of meltwater provides a new, consistent, rationale for ice slipperiness. Hydrophobic coatings are furthermore shown to strongly reduce friction due to a surprising change in the local viscosity, providing an unexpected explanation for waxing effects in winter sports. Beyond ice friction, our results suggest new avenues towards self-healing lubricants to achieve ultralow friction.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "L.
