{"Nomor": 44662, "Judul": "Contribution of Artificial Intelligence to Risk Assessment of Railway Accidents", "Abstrak": "In the design, development, and operation of a\nrail transport system, all the actors involved use one or\nmore safety methods to identify hazardous situations, the\ncauses of hazards, potential accidents, and the severity of\nthe consequences that would result. The main objective is\nto justify and ensure that the design architecture of the\ntransportation system is safe and presents no particular risk\nto users or the environment. As part of this process of\ncertification, domain experts are responsible for reviewing\nthe safety of the system, and are being brought in to\nimagine new scenarios of potential accidents to ensure the\nexhaustiveness of such safety studies. One of the difficulties in this process is to determine abnormal scenarios that\ncould lead to a particular potential accident. This is the\nfundamental point that motivated the present work, whose\nobjective is to develop tools to assist certification experts in\ntheir crucial task of analyzing and evaluating railway\nsafety. However, the type of reasoning (inductive, deductive, by analogy, etc.) used by certification experts as well\nas the very nature of the knowledge manipulated in this\ncertification process (symbolic, subjective, evolutionary,\nempirical, etc.) justify that conventional computer solutions cannot be adopted; the use of artificial intelligence\n(AI) methods and techniques helps to understand the\nproblem of safety analysis and certification of high-risk\nsystems such as guided rail transport systems. To help\nexperts in this complex process of evaluating safety\nstudies, we decided to use AI techniques and in particular\nmachine learning to systematize, streamline, and\nstrengthen conventional approaches used for safety analysis and certification", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Habib Hadj-Mabrouk [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering of railroads & roads", "Kata Kunci": "Rail safety  Risk assessment  Accident scenarios  Artificial intelligence  Machine learning Expert system", "Sumber": "Urban Rail Transit (2019) 5(2):104\u2013122", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Okt 2019"}
