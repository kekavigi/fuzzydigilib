{"Nomor": 44887, "Judul": "Stratified Gas-Liquid Flowean Analysis Of Steady State And Dynamic Simulation For Gas-Condensate Systems", "Abstrak": "In the transport of gas-liquid mixtures, where the amount of liquid condensate is low, a stratified flowpattern is predicted by mechanistic two-phase flow models. In this case, the momentum balance between liquid and the gas phases is the key relation for the calculation of the steady state flow equilibrium\nand the existing liquid hold-up. The latter value is particularly important at low production rates for\npipelines with a large number of upward and downward inclined pipe segments (making V shaped\nsections) where liquid can easily accumulate in the lower parts. The error in predicting the liquid inventory has critical consequences on the evaluation of the total pressure drop along the pipeline. The\nresults obtained from steady state simulation can be far from reality or, at least, cannot be reproduced by\na dynamic simulation of the same operating conditions. These topics are analysed using a multiphase\nflow simulator developed by the author (XPSIM, eXtended Process SIMulation) which can perform\ncompositional and fluid-mechanical analysis at the same time. Steady state and dynamic simulations are\ndeveloped for the Ormen-Lange pipeline (about 120 km long): large differences are found between the\nsteady state and dynamic solutions", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "LUIGI RAIMONDI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Gas-Liquid, Dynamic Simulatio, Gas-Condensate Systems", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 5, Issue 2, Pages 128-132 (June  2019), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2017.11.002", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Nov 2019"}
