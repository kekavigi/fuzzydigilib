{"Nomor": 45259, "Judul": "Well Placement Optimization For Offshore Oilfield Based On Theil Index And Differential Evolution Algorithm", "Abstrak": "Proper well placement should match the\nheterogeneity of reservoir and development schedule, in\nwhich case the displacement is balanced. A balanced displacement process can achieve a good development performance of reservoir. Present parameters to evaluate the\ndisplacement balanced degree are not fit for high water-cut\noilfields and need a specific reservoir simulator. In this\nwork, a well placement optimization method for offshore\noilfield is established. A displacement balanced degree\nevaluation method is proposed based on Theil index. By\nusing minimum Theil index as the objective function, well\nplacement optimization model for offshore oilfield is built.\nIn this model, constraints about the available infilling scope\nand minimum inter-well distance are considered to find the\nrealizable optimal location. This optimization model is\nsolved by a derivative-free optimization algorithm, differential evolution algorithm. This method is applied and\nvalidated in a semisynthetic offshore oilfield to find optimal well locations. Results demonstrate that this proposed\nmethod can find the optimal well placement for offshore\noilfield to achieve a more balanced displacement and a\nhigher oil recovery.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "HONGWEI CHEN [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Qihong Feng", "Xianmin Zhang", "Sen Wang", "Wensheng Zhou", "Chen Liu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Well placement, Optimization model, Offshore oilfield, Theil index, Differential evolution algorithm", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Exploration and Production Technology, Volume 8, Issue 4, 1209-1224 (December 2018), https://doi.org/10.1007/s13202-018-0440-9", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Des 2019"}
