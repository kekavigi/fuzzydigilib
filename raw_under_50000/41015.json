However, little research has been dedicated to vegetation dynamics in the abandoned croplands, which are\nsurrounded by shrub-encroached grasslands. In this study, several abandoned croplands in Ruanliang and\nYingliang in the Ordos Plateauwere selected, and the biomass, coverage, density, root pattern, and plant litter dynamics were studied. The results showed that: (1) The abandoned croplands in Ruanliang experienced three\ncommunity types, including weeds community, the subshrub Artemisia ordosica community, and the perennial\ngrass community.....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Wentao Cai [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Tianyu Guan, Heyi Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Shrub encroachment, Abandoned croplands, Vegetation dynamics, Ordos Plateau", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Jul 2019"}
