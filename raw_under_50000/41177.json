{"Nomor": 41177, "Judul": "CURVATURE-BASED INTERACTIONPOTENTIAL BETWEENMICRO/NANO PLANAR CURVEAND PARTICLE LOCATED OUTSIDE THE CURVE", "Abstrak": "Based on the negative exponential pair-potential (1/R)n, the interaction potential\nbetween the micro/nano planar curve and the particle located outside the curve is studied. We\nverified that, whatever the value of exponent n may be, the potential of particle/plane-curve is\nalways of unified curvature form. Furthermore, we proved that the driving forces acted on the\nparticle may be induced by the highly curved micro/nano curve, and the curvature and gradient\nof curvature are confirmed to be the essential factors forming the driving force. Through the\nidealized numerical experiments, the accuracy and reliability of the curvature-based potential are\nexamined.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xugui Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ya jun Yin,   Jiye Wu, Kun Huang, Dan Wang, Qinshan Fan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "micro/nano planar curve, curvature-based potential, driving force, curvature and the gradient of curvature", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 4, August, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Jul 2019"}
