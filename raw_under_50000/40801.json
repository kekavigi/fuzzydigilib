Elements with both\nsingle layer and two layers of gradient are presented. The general stress field is obtained through\nan asymptotic analysis coupled with Westergaard\u2019s stress function approach. With the aid of\nboundary collocation technique, convergence of the derived stress field is verified. Effectiveness\nand efficiency of the element is investigated through calculation and comparison. Based on that\nelement, stress field of FGM plate under different loading cases is studied briefly.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "C he n Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["X iw u X u"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "finite element method, hybrid method, complex function, functionally graded ma- terials", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 27, No. 3, June, 2014", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Jul 2019"}
