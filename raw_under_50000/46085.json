{"Nomor": 46085, "Judul": "SEMICONDUCTING POLYMER NANOMATERIALS AS NEAR-INFRARED PHOTOACTIVATABLE PROTHERAPEUTICS FOR CANCER", "Abstrak": "Cancer therapy is routinely performed in the clinic to cure cancer and\ncontrol its progression, wherein therapeutic agents are generally used. To reduce side\neffects, protherapeutic agents that can be activated by overexpressed cancer biomarkers\nare under development. However, these agents still face certain extent of off-target\nactivation in normal tissues, stimulating the interest to design external-stimuli activatable\nprotherapeutics. In this regard, photoactivatable protherapeutic agents have been utilized\nfor cancer treatments. However, because of the intrinsic features of photolabile moieties,\nmost photoactivatable protherapeutic agents only respond to ultraviolet?visible light,\nlimiting their in vivo applications. Thus, protherapeutic agents that can be activated by\nnear-infrared (NIR) light with minimal phototoxicity and increased tissue penetration\nare highly desired....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jingchao Li  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Kanyi Pu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Semiconducting Polymer Nanomaterials, Photoactivatable Protherapeutics, Cancer", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "14 Feb 2020"}
