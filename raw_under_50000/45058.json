The research was conducted in a cohort-based astronomy MOOC \u201cAstronomy:\nExploring Time and Space\u201d provided through the Coursera platform. In order to discern motivations of\ncourse participants, the Science Motivation Questionnaire II was administered as a first assignment of the\ncourse. The survey data were collected from December 2016 until December 2018 and responses from\n3701 learners were acquired. In order to determine the relationship of motivation to course performance,\nfour course engagement indicators are defined: course completion, use of video lectures, participation in\nthe discussion forums, and participation in peer-grading assignments. Self-determination and self-efficacy are identified as the main motivational factors influencing all aspects of the course engagement except for the video usage. We show that both of these decrease with age, but increase with the number of previously taken science courses. The main reasons for signing up for the course which had an effect on course engagement were the goal of getting a certificate and perceived importance of the reputation of the instructor. There was no statistically significant difference in motivations between people who dropped after the first peer graded writing assignment and those who successfully completed the course, suggesting that after the first writing assignment learners quit from other reasons than lack of motivation.\nUnexpectedly, learners with high career, grade, and social motivation watched statistically significantly\nfewer instructional videos, and social motivation did not play a role in the forum usage.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Martin Formanek [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sanlyn Buxner,  Chris Impey, and Matthew Wenger"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH 15, 020140 (2019), APS", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Nov 2019"}
