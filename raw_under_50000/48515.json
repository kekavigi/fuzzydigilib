{"Nomor": 48515, "Judul": "DESIGN OPTIMIZATION AND VALIDATION OF IMPACT ENERGY ABSORBING SYSTEM FOR LIGHTWEIGHT VEHICLE APPLICATION", "Abstrak": "Railway transportation, one of the mass transportations types, ought to protect the occupant in the event of accidents by considering crashworthiness safety issues. The objective of this research is to increase the occupant protection by optimizing impact energy absorbing system on Light Rail Transit (LRT) subjecting to axial impact loading, according to international regulation UIC/EN 15227. The validation is carried out by utilizing the critical crashworthy component of a thin-walled cylinder.\nThe focus of the optimization process is to reduce the initial peak force (IPF) and effective deceleration (ED) value based on the crashworthiness performance of baseline design. Otherwise, other parameters, such as stroke efficiency (SE), crushing force efficiency (CFE), specific energy absorption (SEA), and static test (regulated in UIC/EN12663) are bounded as the optimization constraints. System topological design is optimized by varying the components\u2019 thickness, material, and the cross-section and the number of crash boxes attached to the system. 60 trained data model is evaluated in the Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) process. The combination of ANN, NSGA-II, and MOORA is used for optimization. The validation process, then, is executed as the comparison of simulation and available experimental data is used as the validation analysis.\nThe optimization process has been done on various system designs and configurations. The optimized design has a configuration of 8 circular crash boxes, 1.8 mm, 3.5 mm and 4.0 mm, crash box, end under frame, and pusher bar/ crossbar thickness with AA6005-T5 material. The system is verified with available experimental data. Full-scale system configuration can be done as the future works of this researc", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Raynald Masli": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/208340"}, "Penulis": "Raynald Masli [23619015]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
