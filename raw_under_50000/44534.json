{"Nomor": 44534, "Judul": "Pre-Timed and Coordinated Traffic Controller Systems Based on AVR Microcontroller", "Abstrak": "The major weaknesses of traffic controllers in Indonesia are unable to accommodate the variety\nof traffic volume and unable to be coordinated. To solve the problem, a pre-timed and coordinated traffic\ncontroller system is built. The system consists of a master and a local controller. Each controller has a\ndatabase containing signal-timing plans. To synchronize the signal-timing, the master controller sends the\nsynchronization data to the local controller wirelessly, and the local controller can modify a cycle length by\nadding or subtracting the green interval of any phases. The transition time for synchronization only takes\none to several cycles. The algorithm for controlling the traffic including coordination can be done by an\nAVR microcontroller. Memory usage of the microcontroller is lower than 10%, meanwhile the CPU\nutilization is no more than 1%, and thus the systems could be widely developed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Freddy Kurniawan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Denny Dermawan , Okto Dinaryanto , Mardiana Irawati"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Architecture", "Kata Kunci": "traffic controller, pre-timed, coordinated, AVR microcontroller", "Sumber": "TELKOMNIKA; Yogyakarta Vol. 12, Iss. 4,  (Dec 2014): 787-794.", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Okt 2019"}
