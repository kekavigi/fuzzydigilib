{"Nomor": 41237, "Judul": "ONTHE INTERACTIONBETWEEN A QUARTZ CRYSTAL RESONATORAND ANARRAY OF MICRO-BEAMS IN THICKNESS-SHEAR VIBRATIONS", "Abstrak": "We studied the coupled dynamic behavior of a quartz-crystal-resonator (QCR)/microbeams\nsystem in the thickness-shear motions. Through taking into account the couple stress in\nthe dynamic equations of the quartz plate, both continuous conditions of shear force and bending\nmoment at the resonator/micro-beams interface are realized. Frequency shift of the compound\nQCR system induced by micro-beams is studied in detail. The obtained results are useful in device\ndesign and frequency-stability analysis of quartz crystal resonators.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lingcheng Kong [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xuan Xie, Jun Zhang, Yuxi Wang, Yuantai Hu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "quartz crystal resonator, couple stress, frequency shift", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 5, October, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Agu 2019"}
