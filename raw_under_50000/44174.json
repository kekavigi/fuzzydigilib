{"Nomor": 44174, "Judul": "KEY FACTORS OF URBAN FARMING SUSTAINABILITY IN BANDUNG CITY", "Abstrak": "Urban farming activity in Bandung began with the urban farming movement\ninitiated by the Bandung Berkebun community in 2011. Since 2014, this activity\nhas been regarded as a flagship program by the Department of Food Security and\nAgriculture, which means that it receives governmental (including financial)\nsupport. Urban farming has raised expectations of Bandung City practitioners and\nobservers as a solution to land use ineffectiveness, food security and environmental\nissues in a densely populated city. After more than seven years since it started, the\nurban farming program demonstrates many advantages, but on the other hand, it\nperforms poorly in terms of its development and sustainability. Therefore, this\nresearch aims to identify the main factors of urban farming sustainability through\nfour research phases, namely: 1) elaborate a historical framework of urban farming\ngrowth in Bandung; 2) define the form and pattern of the urban farming community\nin Bandung via thematic content analysis; 3) calculate the economic, social and\nenvironmental value of urban farming in Bandung using preliminary cost-benefit\nanalysis; and 4) identify the main problems with the Ishikawa technique of analysis.\nThe data were collected from semi structured, in-depth interviews with six key\nstakeholders and questionnaire-based surveys completed by 46 urban farming\ncommunity leaders. The final results of each analysis converged into the key factors\nof urban sustainability namely (1) economic: contribution to household economy;\n(2) environmental and physical: certainty of land access availability; and (3) social:\ncommunity leadership.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Ratih Wulandari": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184683", "BAB 1 Ratih Wulandari": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184684", "BAB 2 Ratih Wulandari": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184685", "BAB 3 Ratih Wulandari": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184686", "BAB 4 Ratih Wulandari": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184687", "BAB 5 Ratih Wulandari": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184688", "BAB 6 Ratih Wulandari": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184689", "DAFTAR Ratih Wulandari": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184690", "2019 TS PP RATIH WULANDARI_LAMPIRAN.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184691"}, "Penulis": "Ratih Wulandari [25417012]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ridwan Sutriadi, S.T., M.T., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Perencanaan Wilayah dan Kota", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Arsitektur, Perencanaan dan Pengembangan Kebijakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "urban farming, Bandung, thematic content analysis, preliminary costbenefit analysis, key sustainability factors", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yoninur Almira", "File": "9 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Okt 2019"}
