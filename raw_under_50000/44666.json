The institutional constraints imposed on the SRTUs\nresult in low productivity and inefficiency. In this fiercely\ncompetitive environment, the state-owned public transport\nindustry cannot operate sustainably, showing mediocre\nperformance. With relatively scarce financial resources,\nhigh political expectations, and competition between\noperators, the efficiency and performance of the industry\nmust be improved by optimizing the available resources. In\nthis study, an integrated analytical hierarchy process\u2013goal\nprogramming technique considering both operators\u2019 and\nusers\u2019 perceptions is used for performance optimization.\nThe methodology starts with the selection of various performance indicators, considering both operators\u2019 and users\u2019\nperceptions. The decision variables are then categorized\ninto user-oriented and operator-oriented. The analytical\nhierarchy process (AHP), a multicriteria decision-making\ntool, is then used to evaluate the decision variables and\ncalculate their weights to be used as penalties in goal\nprogramming (GP). Pairwise comparison of decision\nvariables on the AHP rating scale was carried out by\nexperts associated with bus transportation and academia.\nThis was used to assign weights to the variables to denote\ntheir priority based on their importance. Then, these\nweights were assigned to the objective function of the GP\nproblem to find a solution that minimizes the weighted sum\nof deviations from the goal values. As a case study, performance optimization of the Kerala State Road Transport\nCorporation was undertaken. Twelve decision variables\nwere identified, by taking into account both user and\noperator perceptions, viz. controllable costs, noncontrollable costs, taxes, staff per bus ratio (fleet operated), safety,\naccessibility, regularity, load factor, fleet utilization, percentage of dead kilometers to effective kilometers, journey\nspeed, and percentage of cancelled kilometers to scheduled\nkilometers. The perceived importance of each of these\ndecisive factors from both the users\u2019 and operators\u2019 perspectives was obtained from the experts and prioritized\nusing the AHP. The results indicated that operator cost and\nstaff per schedule were the most important variables for the\noperators, while safety of travel had the highest weighting\naccording to the users\u2019 perceptions. The optimal solution\nindicated that increasing the accessibility, safety, and regularity would attract passengers to public transport, which\nwould in turn improve the load factor and influence operators to maximize fleet utilization and reduce cancellation\nof schedules. Moreover, the solution also suggested that\ndecreasing the staff per bus would further reduce the\noperating cost. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis was carried out to identify the impact of variations in the decision\nvariables on the performance of the system. The presented\nmethod could be used for performance evaluation and\noptimization of urban rail, metro, and various other public\ntransport systems.\n& Raviraj H.

Mitigation of this transport crisis has become a challenging task in the transport\nindustry. Development of public transport has been identified as a sustainable solution for all major transport\nproblems. Moreover, public transport is the primary and\nonly means of transport for a large section of society in\nIndia. The Working Group of Urban Transport [1] has\nsuggested a desirable share of public transport of 60% of\nmotorized trips to reduce energy needs and address the\ntransport crisis. Public transport undertakings are striving\nto provide efficient and convenient travel. However, they\nare not providing better travel options due to various\nchallenges in the public transport industry, such as financial\ninstability, incompetence, and unreliability. Excessive\noperating cost, overstaffing, low productivity, and imprudent use of financial resources are a few of the institutional\nissues, while inadequate frequency, increased travel time,\npoor service quality, and overcrowding are a few of the\nreasons why users are shifting away from public transport.\nThe declining share of public transport has caused the\npublic transport industry to become loss-making.\nWhile the government has a complete monopoly over\nthe rail transport sector, there are many competing players\nin the road transport industry. In this fiercely competitive\nenvironment, state-owned public transport industry cannot\noperate sustainably, showing mediocre performance. In this\nrespect, a crucial question is to identify which operating\npractices and administrative regulations could improve the\npublic transport industry. Meanwhile, inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and the potential of public transport should be\ndetermined by evaluating the performance in the current\nscenario. Moreover, to improve the performance and efficiency in the face of reduced budgets, high political\nexpectations, and competition between operators, the performance of the industry must be improved by optimizing\nthe available resources.\nIn recent years, performance evaluation has become a\nfocus of attention in the public transport industry, as it is\nviewed as a method to assess the outcomes of the system,\nwhich can be further analyzed to decide upon improvement\nstrategies. Since public transport involves multiple stakeholders, optimization procedures must be performed rather\nthan just evaluation.
