We propose the use of fuzzy integral (FI) operators to combine support vector machines (SVMs) associated with different local features. Presently, we focus on local histogrambased features that describe different kinds of handwriting traits to ensure SVM complementarity. First, we introduce a new feature based on the histogram of templates that aims to highlight local orientations of the text strokes. As a second feature, we propose the rotation invariant uniform local binary patterns to enhance local textural information, whereas the third feature is the gradient local binary patterns. Various forms of the FI are used for combining these predictors. Experiments are conducted on\nfour standard datasets of English, Arabic and French handwritten text. First, for each language, the prediction task is evaluated by considering text-independent and writer-independent design. Then, a more challenging prediction is tried by adding the language-independency constraint. The results obtained confirm the effectiveness of the proposed features. Also, they highlight the contribution of the combination step to achieve a robust prediction.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Nesrine Bouadjenek [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hassiba Nemmour, Youcef Chibani"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "IET Biometrics", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Sep 2019"}
