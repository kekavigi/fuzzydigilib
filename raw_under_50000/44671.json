{"Nomor": 44671, "Judul": "Design of Passenger Aerial Ropeway for Urban Environment", "Abstrak": "Aerial ropeway is an effective alternative to the\nconventional modes of land public transport in metropolitan areas and cities. Construction of passenger aerial\nropeways in urban environment is a very costly enterprise\nin terms of engineering and economics, and requires significant financial resources. This article is aimed at the\ndevelopment of the design method of the passenger aerial\nropeway, ensuring the reduction in its construction cost.\nFor this purpose, the individual components of the construction cost are considered, and the approximate calculation dependencies are proposed. It is shown that the cost\nof the aerial ropeway is mainly influenced by the installation step, height of intermediate towers and carrying rope\ntension. The task of the conditional nonlinear optimization\nof the given parameters is formulated and solved in the\nresearch. This task ensures the minimum cost of the aerial\nropeway. The optimization task is done by taking into\naccount possible limitations on the ropeway laying in the\nseverely urbanized environment (the terrain, urban infrastructure arrangement, altitude performance of the urban\ndevelopment, technical characteristics of the carrying rope,\netc.). Implementing the solution findings of the given\noptimization task makes it possible to significantly reduce\nthe construction cost of aerial ropeways in urban\nenvironment.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Alexander V.
