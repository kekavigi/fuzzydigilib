Several areas of focus have been proposed to guide the preparation of teachers for working\nwith ELs, including: language related knowledge, skills, and dispositions. This narrative study examined\nhow field-based experiences shaped 49 preservice teachers' dispositions toward ELs. An iterative and\nthematic analysis of collected narratives found that preservice teachers often completed their practicum\nin classrooms that did not model positive dispositions or pedagogical practices toward ELs. These\nfindings have implications for the tasks and experiences given to preservice teachers during their\npreparation sequence.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Amanda T.
