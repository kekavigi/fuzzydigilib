The governing equations are formulated and found to be nonlinear because\nof the temperature-dependence of properties. Owing to the nonlinearity of the governing equa-\ntions, the finite element method is resorted to for solution. The results obtained show that the\ntemperature-dependent properties influence the variables considered by reducing their magni-\ntudes. This indicates that taking the temperature-dependence of properties into consideration in\nthe investigation of generalized thermoelastic problems is necessary and practical for accurately\npredicting the thermoelastic behavior.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "T ianhu He [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Shuanhu Shi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Green and Lindsay theory, thermal shock, finite element method, thermal wave, temperature-dependent properties", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 27, No. 4, August, 2014", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "16 Jul 2019"}
