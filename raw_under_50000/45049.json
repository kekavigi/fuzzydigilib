{"Nomor": 45049, "Judul": "AI COPERNICUS 'DISCOVERS' THAT EARTH ORBITS THE SUN", "Abstrak": "Astronomers took centuries to figure it out. But now, a machine-learning algorithm inspired by the brain has\nworked out that it should place the Sun at the centre of the Solar System, on the basis of how movements of the Sun and Mars appear from Earth. The feat is one the first tests of a technique that researchers hope\nthey can use to discover new laws of physics, and perhaps to reformulate quantum mechanics, by finding patterns in large data sets. The results are due to appear in Physical Review Letters (R. Iten et al. Phys. Rev. Lett.; in the press).", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "- [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Astronomi", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "TATA SURYA", "Sumber": "266 | Nature | Vol 575 | 14 November 2019", "Staf Input/Edit": "pustaka bosscha", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Nov 2019"}
