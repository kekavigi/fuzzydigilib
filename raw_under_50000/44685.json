{"Nomor": 44685, "Judul": "A Safety Management and Signaling System Integration Method for Communication-Based Train Control System", "Abstrak": "The safety and the correctness of signaling system not only relate to the safety and efficiency of the rail\ntransit operation, but also link with the life safety of passengers. In order to guarantee the safety of a signaling\nsystem for metro, the safety certificate for the trial operation with carrying passengers must be obtained. In this\npaper, a suitable safety management and signaling system\nintegration model are explored according to the CENELEC\nstandards and applied in China. With taking account of the\nstrict safety requirements for the Communication-Based\nTrain Control (CBTC) system, a safety assurance and\nassessment method based on safety verification and validation process was put forward. This method was applied\nin every phase of the CBTC system development life cycle\nto monitor and control each activity in the life cycle and to\nreview each document in system development process. At\nthe same time, this method is also used to ensure the\ntraceability of relevant documents and to test all the\nfunctions of the whole system sufficiently and completely.\nSo that the safety operation of train control system can be\nensured. Up to now, the independently developed CBTC\nsystem with the safety management had been applied in\nmany urban rail transit lines of Beijing, such as Yizhuang\nLine, Changping Line, Line No. 14, and Line No. 7. The\nCBTC signaling systems of these projects have been\nauthorized by the safety certification from a third party,\ne.g., Lloyd Register which is a British company and\nfamous for the safety verification and validation process.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Fei Yan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["\u2022 Chunhai Gao   \u2022 Tao Tang   \u2022 Yao Zhou"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering of railroads & roads", "Kata Kunci": "sRail transit system,  CBTC,  Safety management,  Signaling system,  Safety verification and validation,  System safety assurance", "Sumber": "Urban Rail Transit (2017) 3(2):90\u201399", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Okt 2019"}
