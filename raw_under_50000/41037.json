{"Nomor": 41037, "Judul": "Quantum Electrodynamical Bloch Theory with Homogeneous Magnetic Fields", "Abstrak": "We propose a solution to the problem of Bloch electrons in a homogeneous magnetic field by including\nthe quantum fluctuations of the photon field. A generalized quantum electrodynamical (QED)-Bloch\ntheory from first principles is presented. In the limit of vanishing quantum fluctuations, we recover the\nstandard results of solid-state physics: the fractal spectrum of the Hofstadter butterfly. As a further\napplication, we show how the well-known Landau physics is modified by the photon field and that Landau\npolaritons emerge. This shows that our QED-Bloch theory does not only allow us to capture the physics of\nsolid-state systems in homogeneous magnetic fields but also novel features that appear at the interface of\ncondensed matter physics and quantum optics.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Vasil Rokaj [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Markus Penz,", "Michael A.
