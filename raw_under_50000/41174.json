{"Nomor": 41174, "Judul": "SYMPLECTICANALYSIS FORWAVE PROPAGATION OFHIERARCHICALHONEYCOMB STRUCTURES", "Abstrak": "Wave propagation in two-dimensional hierarchical honeycomb structures with two-\norder hierarchy is investigated by using the symplectic algorithm. By applying the variational prin-\nciple to the dual variables, the wave propagation problem is transformed into a two-dimensional\nsymplectic eigenvalue problem. The band gaps and spatial filtering phenomena are examined to\nfind the stop bands and directional stop bands. Special attention is directed to the effects of the\nrelative density and the length ratio on the band gaps and phase constant surfaces. This work\nprovides new opportunities for designing hierarchical honeycomb structures in sound insulation\napplications.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Kai Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zichen Deng, Xiaojian Xu, Xiuhui Hou, Junmiao Meng"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "hierarchical honeycomb structures, wave propagation, band gap, phase constant surface, symplectic analysis", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 3, June, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Jul 2019"}
