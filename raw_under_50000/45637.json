{"Nomor": 45637, "Judul": "STUDY OF THE NUMBER AND TYPES OF PRESCRIPTION ERRORS IN MALAYSIAN HOSPITAL", "Abstrak": "Background and purpose: The prescribing of medicines is an essential skill required by\ndoctors. For every prescribing decision the potential for benefit needs to be balanced against the\nrisk of harm. The prescriber must use clinical knowledge skills based on patient\u2019s pathology\nconditions. Prescribing errors are potentially preventable source of harm to patients and are\ntherefore an important target for improvement. Method: This research was done retrospectively\nfrom the month of January to June 2014 in pharmacy department of one of the Malaysian\ngovernment hospitals. All prescriptions received in six months were collected and only\nprescriptions with one or more errors would be evaluated. Result: Total prescription errors\ndetected in six months were 1390 in which January(242), February(170), March(252), April\n(241), May(233), June(253). Percentage of error calculated and highest error was made in March\nand June 2014, 18.0% and average of 16.67% in six months time. The department which\nencountered the highest error was the medical department, 58.84% and lowest error in eye\ndepartment, 3.23%. Inappropriate regime type of prescription error has contributed to most of the\nprescription errors in all months and in medical department. Conclusion: As the result, the total\nerrors detected were 1390 out of 33891 prescriptions evaluated. Suggestion: A study to compare\ntypes as well as the frequency of prescribing error made by prescribers of other degree should be\ncarried out to get a clearer picture on Malaysia prescribing errors epidemiology.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Thulasi Letchimanan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/195162"}, "Penulis": "Thulasi Letchimanan [10712762]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Kusnandar Anggadiredja, S.Si., M.Si.", "Dr. Neng Fisheri Kurniati, S.Si., M.Si., Apt."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sains dan Teknologi Farmasi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Farmasi", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Jan 2020"}
