{"Nomor": 45501, "Judul": "METHOD VALIDATION OF GLUCOSAMINE HCL LEVEL DETERMINATION IN TABLET SUPPLEMENT WITH SPECTROPHOTOMETRY UV-VISIBLE USING CHLORAMINE-T AND CRYSTAL VIOLET REAGENTS", "Abstrak": "Glucosamine is a hexosamine sugar compound, naturally produced inside the body and concentrated\nwithin the cartilage. Glucosamine supplements are among the most commonly used products to lighten\nthe symptoms in osteoarthritis. High dose or prolonged use of glucosamine could increase the risk of\ndeveloping diabetes. Therefore, determination of glucosamine in dossage form is needed. By its\nstructure, glucosamine does not have a chromophoric group so that analysis with Spectrophotometry\nUV-Visible method cannot be done directly, but it needs a pre-treatment reaction. The purpose of this\nresearch was to validate determination method of glucosamine HCl level with spectrophotometry UV-\nVisible method using chloramine-T and crystal violet reagents in acidic state and determination of\nglucosamine HCl level in commercial tablet. Glucosamine HCl was dissolved in aquadest and reacted\nwith 0.02 M chloramine-T in acidic state (HCl 2 M), the reaction was allowed for 15 minutes then\nadded 0.01% crystal violet to react for 5 minutes. The result of this reaction was analyzed with\nSpectrophotometer UV-Visible Beckman DU 720 with maximum absorbtion wavelength at 435 nm.\nThis study gave linearity in range of 12-86 ?g/mL with correlation coefficient (r) of 0.9996, accuracy\nwith percent recovery of 98.61-101.12%; repeatability with coefficient of variance of 1.19, and\ninterday presicion with coefficient of variance day one, two, and three were 1.19, 1.71, and 1.14%,\nrespectively. Meanwhile for glucosamine HCl standard spiked method, the study gave accuracy with\npercent recovery of 98.39-100.69% and presicion with coefficient of variance of 1.61%. Glucosamine\nHCl level determination with spectrophotometry UV-Visible method with chloramine-T and crystal\nviolet reagents provide a valid result dan levels of glucosamine HCl in commercial tablet A, B, and C\nwere 96.11, 103.55, and 93.02%, respectively.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Tasha Vania Hendarto": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/193373"}, "Penulis": "Tasha Vania Hendarto [10711116]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. rer. nat.
