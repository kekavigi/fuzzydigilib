{"Nomor": 40110, "Judul": "GEODETIC INVERSION FOR AQUIFER DAMAGE MODEL IN SEMARANG CITY BASIN, CENTRAL JAVA, INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "An aquifer may be defined as a formation that contains sufficient saturated permeable\nmaterial to yield significant quantities of water to wells and springs. Aquifer system\nin Semarang city basin is mainly divided into two different types including\nunconfined aquifer with an average depth of 3 \u2013 18 meters and confined aquifer with\nan average depth from 50 \u2013 90 meters.\nUrbanization and industrialization processes cause groundwater in Semarang city area\nto be overexploited to meet the needs for domestic and industrial use. As a result, the\naquifer system in Semarang city is being partially damaged. Damaged aquifer has the\nlower possibility to store the water because its void, porosity and hydraulic\nconductivity are reduced dramatically. Damaged aquifer also intensifies water\nscarcity and affects the water security in the future.\nThere is a difficulty in estimating water table decline due to the limited on-site\ngroundwater data. Luckily, there is correlation between water table decline and land\nsubsidence from existing publications in several places across the world. While\naquifer damage can be estimate from water table decline value. The correlation is\nused as an alternative to do inversion to calculate water table decline from land\nsubsidence data. Therefore, this research is to create two mathematical models for\nestimating water table decline. Model 1 is built based on the field data of groundwater\nin Semarang in correlation with land subsidence data and Model 2 is built by using\nthe correlation data from existing publications.\nThe research shows that Model 1 and Model 2 well represent for the correlation\nbetween land subsidence and water table decline in Semarang city basin. The two\nmodels give the similar resulting water table decline. Consequently, the two models\ncan be used interchangeably. Moreover, Model 2 can be also used for other places in\nthe world in consideration of VS30 similarity.\nAccording to water table decline value estimated by both Model 1 and Model 2, more\nthan 70 percent of the aquifer system of Semarang city basin will be damaged and\nvery damaged in 2050 if there is no action taken to stop the subsidence phenomenon.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Mai Cong Nhut": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/173607", "COVER Mai Cong Nhut": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/196071", "BAB 1 Mai Cong Nhut": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/196072", "BAB 2 Mai Cong Nhut": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/196073", "BAB 3 Mai Cong Nhut": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/196074", "BAB 4 Mai Cong Nhut": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/196075", "BAB 5 Mai Cong Nhut": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/196076", "PUSTAKA Mai Cong Nhut": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/196077"}, "Penulis": "Mai Cong Nhut [25117701]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Heri Andreas, S.T., M.T.", "Dr. Irwan Meilano, S.T., M.Sc.", "Dr. Susilo, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Geodesi dan Geomatika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Ilmu dan Teknologi Kebumian", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "land subsidence, water table decline, geodetic inversion, aquifer damage", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "8 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Jul 2019"}
