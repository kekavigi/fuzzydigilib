{"Nomor": 42718, "Judul": "BioTAM: a technology acceptance model for biometric authentication systems", "Abstrak": "The increasing demand on biometric authentication systems (BASs) has brought the need of secure and privacypreserving solutions accepted by a wider community of users. The decision makers pay a great attention to how people react to BASs and their opinions about the features and procedures of the system. In this work, a generic Biometric Technology Acceptance Model (BioTAM) is proposed. BioTAM encounters trust as an objective measure of privacy-security tradeoff, public willingness and user confidence. BioTAM takes into account social and human factors which prominently affect the wider dissemination and easy penetration of BASs. To scrutinise people's behavioural intention to use a BAS, BioTAM melds traditional Technology Acceptance Model constructs and the trust model offered as a new construct. In order to inspire stakeholders on how BioTAM can be used to assess a BAS, a sample case study is investigated.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Alper Kanak [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ibrahim Sogukpinar"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "IET Biometrics", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Sep 2019"}
