{"Nomor": 41171, "Judul": "A CONCURRENTMULTISCALEMETHODFOR SIMULATIONOF CRACKPROPAGATION", "Abstrak": "A concurrent multiscale method is developed for simulating quasi-static crack prop-\nagation in which the failure processes occur in only a small portion of the structure. For this pur-\npose, a multiscale model is adopted and both scales are discretized with finite-element meshes.\nThe extended finite element method is employed to take into account the propagation of discon-\ntinuities on the fine-scale subregions. At the same time, for the other subregions, the coarse-scale\nmesh is employed and is resolved by using the extended multiscale finite element method. Several\nrepresentative numerical examples are given to verify the validity of the method.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jingkai Wu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hongwu Zhang, Yonggang Zheng"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "concurrent multiscale method, crack propagation, extended finite element method, level set method", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 2, April, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Jul 2019"}
