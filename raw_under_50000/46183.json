{"Nomor": 46183, "Judul": "UTILIZATION OF LIGNIN-DERIVED SMALL MOLECULES: EPOXY POLYMERS FROM LIGNIN OXIDATION PRODUCTS", "Abstrak": "Much effort has been invested in developing methods for\nproducing small molecules from lignin as a way to source feedstock\nchemicals from renewable sources. Significant progress is being made, and\nmethods for deconstructing lignin are producing good yields of small,\nmononuclear aromatic products?sufficient amounts to enable studies of the\npotential use of these compounds as replacements for compounds currently\nproduced from petroleum. To investigate the use of lignin products in\nepoxies, we begin with aromatic acids that can be produced from lignin, treat\nthem with epichlorohydrin to make glycidyl ethers, and investigate the\nthermal and mechanical properties of cured mixtures of these compounds\nwith a commercial epoxy resin (EPON 826) and an anhydride curing agent\n(NMA). While most of the lignin-modified epoxy polymers exhibit good\nphysical and thermal properties, the polymer prepared from p-hydroxybenzoic\nacid (compound 6) has a higher glass-transition temperature (Tg = 159 \u00b0C) than do thermosets made with other ligninderived materials, such as vanillic acid diglycidyl ether (compound 4) and matches the Tg of cured samples of the commercial EPON-826/NMA epoxy system. This is significant, as p-hydroxybenzoic acid is readily available by simple hydrolysis of several different lignins and functions as a drop-in replacement for 50% of the BPA-based material in this commercial system without significant degradation of material properties. The use of lignin-derived small molecules in high-value systems such as epoxies may help improve the economics of biorefineries.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zhen Fang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Matthew C.
