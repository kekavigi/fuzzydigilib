{"Nomor": 41453, "Judul": "DEVELOPING A MODEL OF OPEN ACCESS INSTITUTIONAL REPOSITORY IN INDONESIA HIGHER EDUCATION: A STUDY IN INDONESIA\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdS RANKING WEB OF REPOSITORIES", "Abstrak": "Based on 2010 census, the population of Indonesia is ranked fourth in the world\nafter China, India, and USA. Indonesian population has a huge potential in term of\nhuman resources, however the recent data shows lack of intellectual contribution\nfrom academic institution if comparing with other Southeast Asia countries, such\nas Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia. Indonesian\u2019s government has attempted to\nenhance the scholarship visibility of Indonesian scholars by building a portal\nnamed Garuda, Garba Rujukan Digital. The portal provides free knowledge\ncontent to the public, albeit the portal depends on its member\u2019s activities to store\nand share their knowledge content. Mostly the members of Garuda are coming\nfrom higher Education institution. The challenge of Garuda is the contributors are\nnot understood the important of sharing their knowledge content. On the other\nhand, some Higher Education institutions have OAIR (Open Access Institutional\nRepository) that actively contribute to Garuda portal. OAIR is refers to a set of\nservices to capture, organize, preserve, and disseminate freely the intellectual\nassets of an organization in digital format to people inside and outside the\norganization.\nThe studies exploring the existing condition of OAIR in Indonesia is still limited.\nThis study is interested in developing a model of OAIR in Indonesia Higher\nEducation. The purpose of this study is to develop a model of OAIR in Indonesia\nHigher Education A conceptual model of OAIR in Indonesia Higher Education\nbased on literature reviews is proposed during the initial stage of the research.\nThis study used qualitative research design, a grounded research approach, to\nexplore OAIRs development in Higher Education. This approach allows for\nthorough understanding of the phenomena being studied. Interviews and Focus\nGroup Discussion (FGD) are used for data gathering. NVivo 10 qualitative\nanalysis software was used to develop categories from data collection derived\nfrom interviews and FGD.\nii\nFrom this research, it can be concluded that a model of OAIR in Indonesia Higher\nEducation comprises of people collaboration, OAIR process, and technological\nfunction. Each of those construct has its elements which are interrelated one and\nanother. People collaboration covers; people collaboration among different\nprofessions, the main knowledge content contributor and view of people on\nOAIR. OAIR process includes: knowledge content recruitment strategies, and\nknowledge organization. While technological function covers; technology basesearch\nengines indexing, technology base-easy upload and easy access, and\ntechnology base-data security system. Other emerging constructs that have\nimpacted on the development of OAIR are webometrics and government policy\nsupporting OAIR.\nBesides, the main findings, three major emerging constructs are identified in this\nstudy; strategic role of OAIR to attain webometrics, OAIR as a green road (the\nway of scholars participate in increasing institution repository by share their\nintellectual publication), and publishing unpublished documents. The campus\nauthorities and academic librarians in higher education institutions can use OAIR\nas a model that developed from this study to assist in developing OAIR in their\ninstitution. The limitation of this research is that the study only includes state\nowned Higher Education Institutions; future research of this study should include\nprivate Higher Education institution.\nKeywords: Knowledge Management (KM), KM initiative, Demand-Driven KM,\nAcademic libraries.
