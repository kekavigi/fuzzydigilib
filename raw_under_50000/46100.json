{"Nomor": 46100, "Judul": "WATER DISTRIBUTION AND CLUSTERING ON THE LYOPHILIZED IGG1 SURFACE: INSIGHT FROM MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS", "Abstrak": "Water has a critical role in the stability of the\nhigher-order structure of proteins. In addition, it is considered to\nbe a major destabilization factor for the physical and chemical\nstability of freeze-dried proteins and peptides. Physical and\nchemical aspects of protein/water relationships are commonly\nstudied with the use of water vapor sorption isotherms for\namorphous lyophilized proteins, which, in turn, are commonly\nanalyzed using the Brunauer?Emmett?Teller (BET) equation to\nobtain the parameters, Wm and CB. The parameter Wm is generally\nreferred to as the \u201cmonolayer limit of adsorption\u201d and has a narrow\nrange of 6?8% for most proteins. In this study, the water distribution on an IgG1 surface is investigated by molecular dynamics\n(MD) simulations at different water contents. The monolayer of water molecules was found to have limited coverage of the protein\nsurface, and the true monolayer coverage of the protein globule actually occurs at a hydration level above 30%. The distribution of\nwater molecules on the IgG1 surface is also highly heterogeneous, and the heterogeneity is not considered in the BET theory. In this\nstudy, a mechanistic model has been developed to describe the water vapor sorption isotherm. This model is based on the analysis of\nthe hydrogen bonding network extracted from the MD simulations. The model is consistent with the experimental Type-II isotherm,\nwhich is usually observed for proteins. The physical meaning of the BET monolayer was redefined as the onset of water cluster\nformation. A simple model to calculate the onset water level, Wm, is proposed based on the hydration of different amino acids, as\ndetermined from the MD simulations.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Shaoxin Feng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Gu?nther H.
