{"Nomor": 43978, "Judul": "STUDY OF WASTE COLLECTION MODELS FOR SLUM SETTLEMENTS IN RIVER BANK SWAMP AREAS A CASE STUDY; MUSI RIVER BANK SETTLEMENT IN PALEMBANG, SOUTH SUMATERA, INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "High population density accompanied by topography in the form of tidal swamp\nareas has resulted in increasingly complex solid household waste problems.\nTherefore, it requires integrated waste handling from storage, collection,\ntransportation to environmentally friendly management. For Palembang case, the\nmost complicated problem is garbage collection. The main objective of this study\nwas to find the solid household waste collection method that was most suitable for\nslum areas with tidal swamp topography.\nTo achieve these objectives, the author assess the weight of factors and alternatives\nusing the AHP (Analysis Hierarchy Process) method. The final result of this\nanalysis is to determine the electability of one of the several alternative schemes\noffered that are considered to be most suitable for the conditions of the study\nlocation based on the opinions of experts to be obtained through expert\nquestionnaires.\nThe results of the analysis show that the most influential factor in determining the\nsolid household waste collection model in the study area is social capacity and\nfollowed by space availability and accessibility. Meanwhile, the method of garbage\ncollection using the house to house collection system is ranked as the most suitable\nalternative for the study area.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Ahmad Zulkarnain": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184201", "BAB 1 Ahmad Zulkarnain": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184202", "BAB 2 Ahmad Zulkarnain": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184203", "BAB 3 Ahmad Zulkarnain": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184205", "BAB 4 Ahmad Zulkarnain": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184206", "BAB 5 Ahmad Zulkarnain": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184207", "BAB 6 Ahmad Zulkarnain": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184208", "DAFTAR Ahmad Zulkarnain": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184209", "2019 TS PP AHMAD ZULKARNAIN_LAMPIRAN.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184210", "2019 TS PP AHMAD ZULKARNAIN_JURNAL.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/184211"}, "Penulis": "Ahmad Zulkarnain [25417095]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Sri Maryati, S.T., M.I.P."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Perencanaan Wilayah dan Kota", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Arsitektur, Perencanaan dan Pengembangan Kebijakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "household waste, swamp, slum, AHP, waste collection, influential factors", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yoninur Almira", "File": "10 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Okt 2019"}
