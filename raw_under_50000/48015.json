{"Nomor": 48015, "Judul": "VERTICALLY COORDINATED POWER SYSTEM OPERATION TO ACCOMMODATE HIGH ELECTRIC VEHICLE UPTAKE LEVELS", "Abstrak": "High future electric vehicle (EV) charging loads risk overloading assets in all\nparts of a power system and incurring excessive electricity production costs.\nTherefore, this paper proposes a strategy is proposed that coordinates the actions of\ntransmission and distribution system operators to meet EV charging demands.\nNovelty and advantages lie in the lack of reliance on day ahead forecasting for\nvertically structured power systems, which are types implemented in many countries\nthroughout the world. The proposed strategy incorporates particle swarm\noptimization, is designed to minimize communication requirements and\nsimultaneously considers the energy demands of EV users. A case study is\nundertaken to demonstrate the strategy effectiveness on the Indonesian Java-Bali\npower system under different and realistic EV uptake scenarios based on\nprobabilistic modelling, survey work and a Monte Carlo modelling approach. Even\nunder slow charging conditions, the case study results show asset overloading and\nelectricity production issues are incurred but they can be resolved through adopting\nthe proposed strategy.", "Daftar File": {"Cover, Abstrak & Lembar Pengesahan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/207609"}, "Penulis": "Yuana Putra Adianto [23218001]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
