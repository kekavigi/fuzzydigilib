{"Nomor": 41538, "Judul": "Statistical method to predict the sunspots number", "Abstrak": "Sunspots are dark regions, it is appearing in the deepest layer of solar atmosphere \u201cphotosphere\u201d, and the average number of sunspots has cycle every 11?year approximately. Sunspots cycles were numbered with solar cycle 1 beginning in 1755 and the most recent solar cycle, is cycle 24, began in December, 2008. Many authors used different techniques and precursor methods to forecast solar sunspots cycles. In this work we applied a new statistical method \u201cautoregressive integrated moving average Models (ARIMA)\u201d on sunspots number data observed by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) during the period 1991 \u2013 2017 (27?years), we predict the sunspot number for the ending of second brunch of current solar sunspots cycle 24. Our prediction of sunspot numbers was compared with the international sunspot number predicted by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Our predictions of monthly mean sunspot numbers along ending years of present solar cycle 24 are in a good agreement with international sunspots number predictions published by NOAA.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "H.I.Abdel-Rahman [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["B.A.Marzouk"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Astronomy", "Kata Kunci": "Statistics, Time series analysis, Sun: sunspots number forecasting", "Sumber": "NRIAG Journal of Astronomy and Geophysics Volume 7, Issue 2, December 2018, Pages 175-179", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Agu 2019"}
