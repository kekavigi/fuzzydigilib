{"Nomor": 41215, "Judul": "AMODIFIED INTERPOLATIONAPPROACHFOR TOPOLOGYOPTIMIZATION", "Abstrak": "In view of the fact that the follow-up search for an optimal topology is affected by\ndeleting a large number of high-relative-density elements. When the typical density interpolation\napproach, namely, solid isotropic microstructures with penalization (SIMP), is employed in the\ncontinuum structural topology optimization, a new density interpolation approach based on the\nlogistic function is proposed in this paper. This method can weaken low-relative-density elements\nwhile enhancing high-relative-density elements by polarization, and then rationally realize polar-\nization of the intermediate density elements. It can reduce the number of gray-scale elements as\nmuch as possible to get the optimal topology with distinct boundaries in conjunction with the sen-\nsitivity filtering method based on particle swarm optimization (PSO). Several typical numerical\nexamples are given to demonstrate this method.", "Daftar File": {"2015 EJRNL PP Yixian Du 1.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/178241"}, "Penulis": "Yixian Du [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Shuangqiao Yan, Yan Zhang, Huanghai Xie, Qihua Tian"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "topology optimization, density interpolation approach, logistic function, gray-scale element", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 4, August, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Jul 2019"}
