{"Nomor": 45258, "Judul": "Design Of Safe Well On The Top Of Atharamura Anticline, Tripura, India, On The Basis Of Predicted Pore Pressure From Seismic Velocity Data", "Abstrak": "Pore pressure prediction is an essential part of wildcat well planning. In India, Tripura sub-basin is characterised by huge\nanticlines, normal faults and abnormally pressured formations. These factors push the wildcat well planning in this area into\nwide margin of uncertainty. Pore pressures were predicted from seismic velocities by using modifed Eaton\u2019s method over\nthe synclinal and fank part of Atharamura to understand the pressure succession towards the anticline. These predicted pore\npressures on the fank part lead to a reasonable match when plotted with ofset well-measured pore pressures. To reduce\nthe uncertainty, fracture pressures were established by various methods such as Hubbert and Willis method and Matthews\nand Kelly method from predicted pore pressures. But the fracture pressures were predicted with available horizontal stress\ncorrelations due to lack of Poisson\u2019s ratio curve for the study area. The mud pressure required to drill the well is calculated\nusing median line principle, and hence drilling mud window is established by assuming virtual tight conditions. The plot\nof equivalent circulation density versus depth suggests that well can be drilled with two casing policy. But it is found that\nadding one more casing pipe will ensure the safety of well. Casing pipes were designed on the basis of collapse pressure,\nburst pressure and tensile load. Finally, a well plan which includes pore pressure, fracture pressure, drilling mud policy,\ncasing policy and kick tolerance graph were proposed to give clear picture on well planning on the top of the anticline in\npore pressure point of view.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "JWNGSAR BRAHMA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Anirbid Sircar"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Pore pressure, Fracture pressure, Atharamura, Tripura", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Exploration and Production Technology, Volume 8, Issue 4, 1209-1224 (December 2018), https://doi.org/10.1007/s13202-018-0440-9", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Des 2019"}
