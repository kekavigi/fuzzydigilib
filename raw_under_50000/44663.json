{"Nomor": 44663, "Judul": "Prediction of Rail Contact Fatigue on Crossings Using Image Processing and Machine Learning Methods", "Abstrak": "In this paper, an application of computer vision\nand machine learning algorithms for common crossing frog\ndiagnostics is presented. The rolling surface fatigue of\nfrogs along the crossing lifecycle is analysed. The research\nis based on information from high-resolution optical images of the frog rolling surface and images from magnetic\nparticle inspection. Image processing methods are used to\npre-process the images and to detect the feature set that\ncorresponds to objects similar to surface cracks. Machine\nlearning methods are used for the analysis of crack images\nfrom the beginning to the end of the crossing lifecycle.\nStatistically significant crack features and their combinations that depict the surface fatigue state are found. The\nresearch result consists of the early prediction of rail contact fatigue.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mykola Sysyn [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ulf Gerber  \u2022 Olga Nabochenko,  \u2022 Dmitri Gruen  \u2022 Franziska Kluge"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering of railroads & roads", "Kata Kunci": "Railway turnout  Common crossing  Image processing  Rolling contact fatigue  Machine learning Feature detection and selection", "Sumber": "Urban Rail Transit (2019) 5(2):123\u2013132", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "31 Okt 2019"}
