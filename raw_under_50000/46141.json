{"Nomor": 46141, "Judul": "L?TYPE CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKER ENHANCES CELLULAR DELIVERY AND GENE SILENCING POTENCY OF CELL-PENETRATING ASYMMETRIC SIRNAS", "Abstrak": "The efficient delivery of small interfering RNAs\n(siRNAs) to the target cells is critical for the pharmaceutical\nsuccess of RNA interference (RNAi) drugs. One of the possible\nstrategies to improve siRNA delivery is to identify auxiliary\nmolecules that augment their cellular uptake. Herein, we performed\na chemical library screening in an effort to discover small molecules\nthat enhance the potency of cholesterol-conjugated, cell-penetrating\nasymmetric siRNAs (cp-asiRNAs). Interestingly, three\ncompounds identified from the screen share a common\ndihydropyridine (DHP) core and function as L-type calcium\nchannel blockers (CCBs). Using confocal microscopy and\nquantitative analysis of small RNAs, we demonstrated that the L-type CCBs increased the endocytic cellular uptake of cpasiRNAs. Furthermore, these small molecules substantially improved the potency of cp-asiRNAs, not only in vitro but also in vivo on rat skin. Collectively, our study provides an alternative pharmacological approach for the identification of small molecules that potentiate the effects of therapeutic siRNAs.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jeong Yong Choe [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Da Seul Son, Yanghee Kim, Jun-kyoung Lee, Hanho Shin"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "L-type calcium channel blocker, cell-penetrating asymmetric siRNA, RNA interference, cellular delivery, gene silencing", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Feb 2020"}
