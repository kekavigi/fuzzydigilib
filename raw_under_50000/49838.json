{"Nomor": 49838, "Judul": "ALPHA-GLUCOSIDASE INHIBITOR ACTIVITY AND REVIEW OF SELECTED PLANTS FROM ACANTHACEAE FAMILY", "Abstrak": "Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is characterized by a complete lack of insulin, a relative lack of\ninsulin, or insulin resistance as well as disorders of other hormones. These defects result in\nan inability to use glucose for energy. There were over 10,276,100 cases of diabetes in\n\u2022\u00ad??????????\u2022?\u00f0???????\u00ad??\u00b1?\u00f0\u2022 \u2022?\u00ad ???????????\u00a3\u2022?\u00b1?\u00f0?\u2022?\u2022?sia in 2017. The total adult\npopulation in Indonesia is 166,531,000 and 20,722,000 in Malaysia. The prevalence of\ndiabetic in adults in Indonesia is 6.7% and 16.9% in Malaysia. The purpose of this research is\nto observe alpha-glucosidase inhibitor activity and to explore the phytochemical and\npharmacological activities of Andrographis paniculata, Clinacanthus nutans, Hemigraphis\nalternata, Strobilanthes crispus and Ruellia tuberosa L. from Acanthaceae family based on\nliterature review.The extraction was done by maceration using ethanol (96% v/v). The\nLiterature review was done by using an electronic database from academic journal, Pubmed,\nSpringerlink and Elsevier. The web filter search using google scholar were attempted by\napplying Andrographis paniculata, Clinacanthus nutans, Hemigraphis alternata,\nStrobilanthes crispus , Ruellia tuberosa L., anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and\nanti-bacterial, in vivo and in vitro !?\u00ad??\u00e3?\u2022?\u00ed??\u00f0\u00ad\u00b1?+?\u00f0\u00e3?\u2022??\u00b1???????\u00b1????-linolenic acid,\nlinalool, quercetin, limonene, alpha-glucosidase inhibitor as keywords. Based on\nphytochemical screening, all of selected plants contained flavonoid and tannin. From the\nliterature review it showed that they consisted various phytochemical compounds in the\nleaves and they contributed to many biological activities (anti-inflammatory, antioxidant\nand anti-bacterial activity). They are quercetin, limonene, linalool, stigmasterol, lupeol and\n?-linolenic acid. One of the isolated compounds from Andrographis paniculata is\nAndrographolide, it belongs to labdane diterpene. It showed alpha-glucosidase inhibitor\nactivity which delay the absorption of carbohydrates in small intestine, thus lowering the\nblood glucose level in body. Based on experiment, cannot determine whether all plants have\nalpha-glucosidase inhibitor activity because limitation of time. However, according to\n?\u00f0?\u00b1?\u2022???\u00b1 ?\u00b1?\u00f0\u00b1??!?\u00ad??\u00e3?\u2022?\u00ed??\u00f0\u00ad\u00b1?+?\u00f0\u00e3?\u2022??\u00b1???\u2022?\u00ad ?-linolenic acid from the plants has the\nalpha-glucosidase inhibitor activities. Besides, Andrographis paniculata, Clinacanthus\nnutans, Hemigraphis alternata, Strobilanthes crispus and Ruellia tuberosa L. have a potential\nto be developed for antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-bacterial activity.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Mohd Yazid Bin Idris": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/211899"}, "Penulis": "Mohd Yazid Bin Idris [11616101]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Muhamad Insanu, S.Si., M.Si.", "Dra.
