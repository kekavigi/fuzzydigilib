{"Nomor": 44526, "Judul": "Design Simulation Program of Runway Capacity Using Genetic Algorithm at Soekarno-Hatta", "Abstrak": "The purposes of this research are to calculate the capacity of runway with runway capacity simulation software using\nGenetic Algorithm, and to analyze the efforts which have more profound effect. To enhance the runway capacity, some strategies\nare researched, such as reduction of separation to meet criteria set by FAA\u2019s rule, addition of the exit taxiway, addition of the\nrunway according to master plan of Soekamo-Hatta Airport and changing the runway utilization strategies. Out of the four\nstrategies, the most efficient solution is changing the runway utilization strategies and reduction in separation. However, the\naddition of runway has the highest capacity increase.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Indra Sulistyo Wibowo [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hoga Saragih, Wisnu Darjono Tulodo Utomo, Rusdianto Roestam"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "genetic algorithm, simulation, runway capacity.", "Sumber": "International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE) Vol.1, No.2, December 2011, pp. 202~212 ISSN: 2088-8708", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Okt 2019"}
