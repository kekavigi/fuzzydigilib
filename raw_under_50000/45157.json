{"Nomor": 45157, "Judul": "On the application of artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm for optimization of well placements in fractured reservoirs; efficiency comparison with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) methodology", "Abstrak": "The application of a recent optimization technique, the artificial bee colony (ABC), was investigated\nin the context of finding the optimal well locations. The ABC performance was compared with the\ncorresponding results from the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, under essentially\nsimilar conditions. Treatment of out-of-boundary solution vectors was accomplished via the Periodic boundary condition (PBC), which presumably accelerates convergence towards the global\noptimum. Stochastic searches were initiated from several random staring points, to minimize\nstarting-point dependency in the established results. The optimizations were aimed at maximizing\nthe Net Present Value (NPV) objective function over the considered oilfield production durations.\nTo deal with the issue of reservoir heterogeneity, random permeability was applied via normal/\nuniform distribution functions. In addition, the issue of increased number of optimization parameters was address, by considering scenarios with multiple injector and producer wells, and cases\nwith deviated wells in a real reservoir model. The typical results prove ABC to excel PSO (in the cases\nstudied) after relatively short optimization cycles, indicating the great premise of ABC methodology\nto be used for well-optimization purposes", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "BEHZAD NOZOHOUR-LEILABADY [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Babak Fazelabdolabadi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Artificial bee colony (ABC), Particle swarm optimization (PSO), Well placement", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 2, Issue 1, Pages 79-89 (March  2016), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.11.004", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Nov 2019"}
