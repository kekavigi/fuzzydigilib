{"Nomor": 48075, "Judul": "OPTIMASI KONVERTER DC-DC BOOST KASKADE MULTIFASA YANG DISEDERHANAKAN", "Abstrak": "One of the renewable energies in electricity generation is the use of solar power plants or often called photovoltaic (PV). The PV output voltage is too small for consumers to use, while on the grid, a high DC voltage is needed so that it can be used on an AC grid voltage. Proposed simplified multiphase cascade DC-DC boost converter is a converter that has a high voltage gain ratio with no extreme duty cycle, small input current ripples, and a small number of components. Six topologies with different cascade and phase levels will be tested and the best topology for the converter can be determined. Analyzes were performed using mathematical modeling and using PSIM as software to simulate the circuit. From the test, the optimal topology that meets the needs of the converter is a two-phase three-phase cascade boost DC-DC converter to reduce input current ripple and have the highest efficiency. Simulation is done to verify the calculation, and it is performed at some input voltage and output power variations.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Jeremy Maringan Tua Napitupulu": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/207714"}, "Penulis": "Jeremy Maringan Tua Napitupulu [18016012]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
