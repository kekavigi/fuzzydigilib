The governing equations of the two-field\nproblem (i.e., the interactions of elastic and magnetic effects) are formulated in a two-dimensional\nmodel. The magnetostriction curves and magnetization loops are calculated over a wide range\nof parameters. The effects of applied magnetic field frequency f and amplitude B0 and critical\ncurrent density on magnetostriction and magnetization are discussed. Results show that the crit-\nical current density of high temperature superconductor (HTS) YBCO has a significant effect on\nthe magnetization and magnetostriction. The pinning-induced magnetostriction which has been\nobserved in experiment can be qualitatively simulated by this model.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zhiwen Gao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Youhe Zhou"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "high temperature superconductor (HTS), giant magnetostriction, magnetization, magneto-mechanical couple, alternating magnetic field", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 4, August, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Jul 2019"}
