{"Nomor": 40925, "Judul": "Evaluation of satellite data efficiency in identification of plant groups", "Abstrak": "Application of remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) techniques has been\nincreased in natural sciences. In fact, it is inevitable applying of these techniques in vegetation studies\ndue to the existence of some problems in traditional methods (e.g. sampling, calculation, analysis and so\non). On this scope, scientists must have sufficient information about the efficiency of these techniques as\na useful tool in their studies. This study aims to evaluate the IRS-P6 LISS III and Landsat ETM+ efficiency\nin plant groups\u2019 identification. In order to this purpose, 143 training samples were collected from areas that\nshowed homogenous composition of plant species in at least area of 3600 m2 (60  60 m). Coordinates of\nthese training samples were recorded using a GPS device and transferred to a GIS database. Also, ENVI 4.2\npackage has used to process and analyze the satellites data. Several methods of processing such as; spectral", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Amir Ahmadpour [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Maryam Shokri, Karim Solaimani , Jamshid Ghorbani"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Plant groups, Remote sensing, Separability, Supervised classification", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Jul 2019"}
