After a se-\nries of uniaxial compression creep tests are performed on asphalt mastic in different temperature\nand stress conditions in order to determine the matrix constitutive parameters, the framework\npresented is validated by comparison with the experiment, and then some predictions of uniaxial\ncompression creep behavior of asphalt mixture in different temperature and stress conditions are\ngiven.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "J un Wu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["X inhua Yang,  Fan Bai"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "asphalt mixture, micromechanics, elastic-viscoelastic correspondence principle, compression creep", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 27, No. 3, June, 2014", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Jul 2019"}
