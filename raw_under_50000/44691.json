Hundreds of million passengers travel by trains within cities.\nHence, the management and maintenance of rail and station facilities are crucial. The paper introduces five centrality measures and explains whether and how these\nmeasures can be applied to the network analysis of urban\nrail systems. Centrality measures were used to identify the\ncharacteristics of Hong Kong\u2019s urban rail system. Results\nshowed that betweenness centrality is the most appropriate\nmeasure to indicate the relative importance of a station\nbased on its potential on strategic facility management and\nrisk management in an urban rail system.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "W.
