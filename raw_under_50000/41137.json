A new fatigue damage evolution equation is developed, in which the pa-\nrameters are obtained in a simple way with reference to the experimental results of fatigue tests\non standard specimens. With the utilization of APDL language on the ANSYS platform, a finite\nelement implementation is presented to perform coupling operation on damage evolution of mate-\nrial and stress redistribution. The fatigue lives of some notched specimens and a Pitch-change-link\nare predicted by using the above approach. The calculated results are validated with experimental\ndata.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Fei Shen [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Weiping Hu, Qingchun Meng, Miao Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "fatigue damage model, damage mechanics, fatigue life, finite element method", "Sumber": "Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Vol. 28, No. 5, October, 2015", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Jul 2019"}
