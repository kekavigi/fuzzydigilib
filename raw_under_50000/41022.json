{"Nomor": 41022, "Judul": "DECAGONAL QUASICRYSTALLINE ELLIPTICAL INCLUSIONSUNDER THERMOMECHANICAL LOADING", "Abstrak": "In this work, an elegant method is proposed to derive the thermoelastic field in-\nduced by thermomechanical loadings in a decagonal quasicrystalline composite composed of an\ninfinite matrix reinforced by an elliptical inclusion. The thermomechanical loadings include a\nuniform temperature change, remote uniform in-plane heat fluxes and remote uniform in-plane\nstresses. The corresponding boundary value problem is ultimately reduced to the solution of two\nindependent sets of four coupled linear algebraic equations, each of which involves four complex\nconstants characterizing the internal stress field. The solution demonstrates that a uniform tem-\nperature change and remote uniform stresses will induce an internal uniform stress field, and that\nuniform heat fluxes will result in a linearly distributed internal stress field within the elliptical\ninclusion. The induced uniform rigid body rotation within the inclusion is given explicitly.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xu Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Peter Schiavone"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "elliptical inclusion, thermomechanical loadings, decagonal quasicrystal, complex variable method", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Jul 2019"}
