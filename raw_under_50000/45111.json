{"Nomor": 45111, "Judul": "A Dynamic Method For Experimental Assessment Of Scale Inhibitor Efficiency In Oil Recovery Process By Water Flooding", "Abstrak": "Scale formation due to the mixing of injection water with formation water causes formation damage and\nreduction in petroleum production. By using scale inhibitors, scale formation/scaling could be prevented.\nIn this work, static experiments were performed with rapid controlled precipitation tests, which were\nundertaken using three different scale inhibitors namely Falat scale inhibitor, Scahib 760 scale inhibitor\nand Scahib 780 scale inhibitor. Results show that parameters such as temperature and pH have significant effects on scale inhibitor efficiency. In this study, at pH of 7.8e9 it was found that an increase in pH\ncan lead to a decrease in SI efficiency. In addition, acquired data shows that Falat scale inhibitor is more\nefficient at 45 C but scale inhibitors (Scahib 760, 780) have better efficiencies at 25 C. SEM tests were\nperformed to find structure deformation and morphology of precipitation crystals, which indicated that\nscale inhibitor can have various effects on crystal's shapes. Finally, dynamic tests were performed with\ncoreflood equipment that indicated higher recovery by using the scale inhibitors. The dynamic tests\nresults show that the recovery factor in the presence of Scahib 760 scale inhibitor is about 58% and\nbreakthrough time is 2099 (sec). In the absence of scale inhibitor, the recovery factor is about 52% and\nbreakthrough time is 2720 (sec).", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "JABER AZIZI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Seyed Reza Shadizadeh", "Abbas Khaksar Manshad", "Amir H.
