{"Nomor": 42315, "Judul": "Design of non-restoring divider in quantumdot cellular automata technology", "Abstrak": "Among all basic arithmetic operations, the division is the most complex one. On the other hand, working on\npost-complementary metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor (CMOS) technology attracts attention of many researchers, while the progress of miniaturisation in CMOS technology faced physical limits. Therefore, in this study, the authors propose a non-restoring divider in quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA), as one of the most promising technology. To achieve an efficient divider, they propose a novel 1 bit full-adder and take advantage of improved design of XOR gate. This design has considerable improvements in terms of cell numbers, delay and area, compared with other dividers. The suggested design is simulated in QCADesigner software and acceptable results are achieved.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mohammad Mohammadi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Saeid Gorgin, Majid Mohammadi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "IET Circuits, Devices & Systems", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Sep 2019"}
