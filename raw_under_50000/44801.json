{"Nomor": 44801, "Judul": "Leggett-Garg macrorealism and the quantum nondisturbance conditions", "Abstrak": "We investigate the relation between a refined version of Leggett and Garg conditions formacrorealism, namely, the no-signaling-in-time (NSIT) conditions, and the quantum mechanical notion of nondisturbance between measurements. We show that all NSIT conditions are satisfied for any state preparation if and only if certain compatibility criteria on the state-update rules relative to the measurements, i.e., quantum instruments, are met. The systematic treatment of NSIT conditions supported by structural results on nondisturbance provides a unified framework for the discussion of the the clumsiness loophole. This extends previous approaches and allows for a tightening of the loophole via a hierarchy of tests able to disprove a larger class of macrorealist theories. Finally, we discuss perspectives for a resource theory of quantum mechanical disturbance related to violations of macrorealism.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Roope Uola [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Giuseppe Vitagliano,", "and Costantino Budroni"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "PHYSICAL REVIEW A100, 042117 (2019), APS", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ratnasari \u00a0\n                                     Ratnasari", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Nov 2019"}
