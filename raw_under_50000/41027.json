{"Nomor": 41027, "Judul": "PREDICTIONOF PROJECTILE PENETRATIONAND PERFORATIONBY FINITE CAVITY EXPANSION METHODWITHTHE FREE-SURFACE EFFECT", "Abstrak": "With a target treated as the incompressible Tresca and Mohr-Coulomb material,\nby assuming that cavity expansion produces plastic-elastic and plastic-cracked-elastic response\nregion, the decay function for the free-surface effect is constructed for metal and geological tar-\ngets, respectively. The forcing function for oblique penetration and perforation is obtained by\nmultiplying the forcing function derived on the basis of infinite target assumption with the de-\ncay function. Then the projectile is modeled with an explicit transient dynamic finite element\ncode and the target is represented by the forcing function as the pressure boundary condition.\nThis methodology eliminates discretizing the target as well as the need for a complex contact\nalgorithm and is implemented in ABAQUS explicit solver via the user subroutine VDLOAD. It\nis found that the free-surface effect must be considered in terms of the projectile deformation,\nresidual velocity, projectile trajectory, ricochet limits and critical reverse velocity. The numerical\npredictions are in good agreement with the available experimental data if the free-surface effect\nis taken into account.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Qin Fang  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiang zhen, Kong Jian, Hong HaoWu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "penetration, perforation, finite spherical cavity expansion, free-surface effect", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Jul 2019"}
