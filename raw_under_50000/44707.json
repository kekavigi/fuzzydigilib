{"Nomor": 44707, "Judul": "Modeling adoption timing of autonomous vehicles: innovation difusion approach", "Abstrak": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to act as an economically-disruptive transportation technology ofering several benefts to the society and causing signifcant changes in\ntravel behavior and network performance. However, one of the critical issues that policymakers are facing is the absence of a sound estimation of their market penetration. This\nstudy is an efort to quantify the efect of diferent drivers on the adoption timing of AVs.\nTo this end, we develop an innovation difusion model in which individuals\u2019 propensities\nto adopt a new technology such as AVs takes infuence from a desire to innovate and a\nneed to imitate the rest of the society. It also captures various sources of inter-personal heterogeneity. We found that conditional on our assumptions regarding the changes in market\nprice of AVs over time, their market penetration in our study region (Chicago metropolitan\narea) will eventually reach 71.3%. Further, model estimation results show that a wide range\nof socio-demographic factors, travel pattern indicators, technology awareness, and perceptions of AVs are infuential in people\u2019s AV adoption timing decision. For instance, frequent\nlong-distance travelers are found to make the adoption decision more innovatively while\nthose who have experienced an accident in their lifetime are found to be more infuenced\nby word of mouth", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ramin Shabanpour [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ali Shamshiripour,  Abolfazl Mohammadian"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Other branches of engineering", "Kata Kunci": "Autonomous vehicles \u00b7 Adoption timing \u00b7 Innovation difusion \u00b7 Heterogeneity \u00b7 Bass model", "Sumber": "Transportation (2018) 45:1607\u20131621 https://doi.org/10.1007/s11116-018-9947-7", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "01 Nov 2019"}
