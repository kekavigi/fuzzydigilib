{"Nomor": 44877, "Judul": "Simulation of Co2 Removal From Ethane With Sulfinol-M+AMP Solvent Instead of DEA Solvent In The South Pars Phases 9 and 10 Gas Processing Facility", "Abstrak": "Raw gas gathered from well production has to be treated to extract its ethane, to remove carbon dioxide\n(CO2) from it and to dry it, so that the send-out ethane gas complies with transport constraints and meets\nsales-gas specifications. Two distinct families of solvents are used generically for such gas treatment:\nchemical and physical solvents. The South Pars gas field development phases 9 and 10 feeds gas and\nnatural gas liquids into a processing and fractionation plant (one of the largest gas processing plants in\nIran), and is associated with concentrations of 5.37% mole CO2 in the raw gas produced. Furthermore,\nthere are potential problems associated with the CO2 treatment, such as the high-energy requirements\nfor amine solvent regeneration, corrosion caused by aqueous amine solvents and waste/losses (solubility,\nvaporization) of the solvent used to remove CO2 in the ethane treatment unit.\nA feasibility simulation study was conducted to evaluate the utilization of Sulfinol-M \u00fe AMP solvent\n(Sulfolane plus Methyl di-ethanol amine plus 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) plus H2O) to replace\nthe aqueous amine solvent (DEA) currently used in the ethane treatment unit of South Pars phases 9 and\n10 gas processing plant. The simulation of the Sulfinol-M \u00fe AMP process demonstrates less energy\nconsumption (11241.242 kw versus 11290.398 kw for DEA), negligible corrosion and lower losses of\nsolvent (376.493 kg/h versus 409.2421 kg/h) relative to alternative solvents considered, because of its\nlow vapor pressure", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "HASSAN GHANBARABADI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Behnam Khoshandam", "David A.
