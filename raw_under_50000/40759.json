The reading \u2014 21 parts per billion (p.p.b.) \u2014 is three\ntimes greater than the previous record, which Curiosity detected back in 2013. Planetary\nscientists track methane on Mars because its presence could signal life; most of Earth\u2019s\nmethane is made by living things, although the gas can also come from geological sources.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SEVEN DAYS [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Astronomi", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "planetary", "Sumber": "420 | NATURE | VOL 570 | 27 JUNE 2019", "Staf Input/Edit": "pustaka bosscha", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Jul 2019"}
