{"Nomor": 45285, "Judul": "Nematic Energy Scale and the Missing Electron Pocket in FeSe", "Abstrak": "Superconductivity emerges in proximity to a nematic phase in most iron-based superconductors. It is\ntherefore important to understand the impact of nematicity on the electronic structure. Orbital assignment\nand tracking across the nematic phase transition prove to be challenging due to the multiband nature of\niron-based superconductors and twinning effects. Here, we report a detailed study of the electronic\nstructure of fully detwinned FeSe across the nematic phase transition using angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy. We clearly observe a nematicity-driven band reconstruction involving dxz, dyz, and dxy\norbitals. The nematic energy scale between dxz and dyz bands reaches a maximum of 50 meV at the\nBrillouin zone corner. We are also able to track the dxz electron pocket across the nematic transition and\nexplain its absence in the nematic state. Our comprehensive data of the electronic structure provide an\naccurate basis for theoretical models of the superconducting pairing in FeSe.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "M.
