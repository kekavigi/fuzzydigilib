{"Nomor": 46157, "Judul": "EXPANDING THE FRONTIERS OF HIGHER-ORDER CYCLOADDITIONS", "Abstrak": "The concept of pericyclic reactions and the explanation of their\nspecificity through orbital symmetries introduced a new way of understanding\nreactions and looking for new ones. One of the 1965 Woodward?Hoffmann\ncommunications described \u201cthe (as yet unobserved) symmetry-allowed 6 + 4\ncombination\u201d, the prediction of a new field of \u201chigher-order\u201d cycloadditions,\ninvolving more than six electrons. Later these authors predicted exo-stereoselectivity\nfor the [6 + 4]-cycloaddition. Chemists rushed to test this prediction (for the most\npart successfully). For more than half a century, chemists have hunted for additional\nhigher-order cycloadditions. The application of catalysis within organic chemistry\nallows the accomplishment of previously unattainable reactions, including higherorder\ncycloadditions...", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "David McLeod [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mathias Kirk Th\u00f8gersen, Nicolaj Inunnguaq Jessen"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Frontiers, Cycloadditions", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Feb 2020"}
