{"Nomor": 45264, "Judul": "Miocene Reservoir Rocks: Pore Throat Size Distribution As A Strong Controller On Petrophysical Attributes Is A Refection Of Facies Change", "Abstrak": "Pore throat size distribution (PSD) is considered a fnger print for each rock type and has strong efects on many petrophysical parameters, so a comparative study was done on irregular subsurface rock samples that belong to Kareem and Rudeis\nFormations of middle and early Miocene, respectively. These samples were collected from San El-Hagar-1 well which is\nlocated to the East of the Nile Delta to show the efect of the diferent lithologies on pore throat size distribution and hence\nmany related reservoir parameters such as displacement pressure, macroporosity, microporosity, mean hydraulic radius and\npermeability distribution function (PDF). For achieving the previous purpose, helium porosity and capillary pressure by\nmercury injection were carried out. Permeability measurements were canceled due to the non-cylindrical irregular nature\nof the tested samples. Porosity showed a great diference between the results of the samples of the two formations. Capillary pressure results showed the presence of characterized pore throat size distribution and hence capillary pressure-derived\nparameters for samples of each formation. PDF showed that samples of Kareem Fm. have better reservoir fow properties\n(permeability) in contrast to those of Rudeis Fm. which have tight reservoir fow properties. In addition, petrographical study\nthrough thin sections and scanning electron microscope displayed the presence of two facies which are feldspathic quartz\nwacke (sandstone facies) of Kareem Fm. and bioclastic sandy wackestone (calcareous facies) of Rudeis Fm. All results were\nconsistent and confrmed the infuence of facies change on PSD and hence the reservoir parameters.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "OSAMA M.
