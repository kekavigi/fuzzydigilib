It has been proved that cooperation between secondary users improves the\naccuracy of the sensing information gathered by the users. However, such cooperation also\nincreases the vulnerability of the network and its exposure to attacks. The paper presents a\nnovel algorithm based on the non-parametric Kruskal\u2013Wallis and Conover\u2013Inman tests to\ndetect and identify the attack of malicious users at the MAC layer. The algorithm, denoted\nby KWD, does not assume a priori knowledge neither of the activity of the primary channel\nnor of the existence and the behavior of malicious users.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ferran Adelantado  [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Christos Verikoukis"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Cognitive radio ad hoc network, MAC layer security, Malicious user detection, Kruskal\u2013Wallis test", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect, Ad Hoc Networks 11 (2013) 2367\u20132380", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Agu 2019"}
