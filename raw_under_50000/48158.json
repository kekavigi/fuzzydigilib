{"Nomor": 48158, "Judul": "IN-SITU STRESS EVALUATION AND HYDRAULIC FRACTURING DESIGN OF X FIELD", "Abstrak": "Well X is an oil well producing on layer X-1 of the Talang Akar reservoir based on well logging\nanalysis, well X is a reservoir with low permeability and has decreased production oil but still has a\nhigh enough reservoir pressure, so it was decided to do hydraulic fracturing on layer X-1, matters that\naffect the evaluation of the success hydraulic fracturing include an increase in productivity index, a\ndecrease in the value of the skin and an increase the rate of production in the formation. In general, the\nprocess of hydraulic fracturing begins with the pre-fracturing stage, which consists of a breakdown test,\nstep rate test, mini fracturing, and then proceed with the main fracturing.\nThe main challenge to perform hydraulic fracturing design is to make sure the formation can be\npropagated properly. This challenge is usually affected by the stress properties between the layers so\nthe stress property must be considered before doing the geometry fracture design. In the fracture\ngeometry design process the data is analyzed by assuming that the model formed is the PKN (Perkins,\nKern & Nordgren) model that indicates the fracture length that is formed is larger than the fracture\nheight, then the fracture geometry model will produce fracture geometry design consist of fracture\nlength, fracture height, and fracture width and then used to estimate the success parameters of\nhydraulic rock fracture in X-1 layer\nThis study provides an analysis of the selection of the number of proppants according to the needs in\nhydraulic fracture design methods based on technical and economic evaluation and will provide\nrecommendations for optimum development scenarios to maximize production.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Farhah Fahyuna Abubakar [12216094]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ardhi Hakim Lumban Gaol, S.T., M.T., M.Si., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "hydraulic fracturing, production rate, productivity index.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Jun 2020"}
