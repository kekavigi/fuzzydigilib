{"Nomor": 48634, "Judul": "IN VITRO ANTHELMINTIC ACTIVITY OF ALPINIA GALANGA L., CURCUMA LONGA L. AND ZINGIBER OFFICINALE VAR. RUBRUM ON ASCARIS SUUM.", "Abstrak": "Alpinia galanga Linn. (greater galangal), Curcuma longa Linn. (turmeric) and Zingiber officinale var.\nRubrum (red ginger) are plants from Zingiberaceae family. They are known for many healing\nproperties such as antiulcerative, antidiuretic and anthelmintic. Ascaris lumbricoides causes\nascariasis which is the most common helminthic infection. A. lumbricoides is indistinguishable with\nA. suum. This study aims to determine the in vitro anthelmintic activity of ethanolic extract rhizome\nA. galanga, C. longa and Z. officinale var. Rubrum on A. suum. Anthelmintic activity was evaluated\nby measuring the time taken for the helminths to paralyze. Paralysis is determined by placing an\nunmoving helminth in warm water and observing its movement. Data obtained was analysed using\none-way anova. The results obtained for time of paralysis were A. galanga 3.90 and 2.58 hours; C.\nlonga 8.33 and 3.15 hours and Z. officinale var. Rubrum 7.08 and 5.08 hours for 10 and 70 mg/mL\nrespectively. All test groups underwent flaccid paralysis and showed a significant difference\n(p<0.05) when compared with negative control normal saline with time of death 72 hours. The\ngroup treated with A. galanga and C. longa 70mg/mL showed no significant difference (p>0.05)\nwhen compared to pyrantel pamoate 0.1mg/mL with time of paralysis 3.13 hours. In conclusion, A.\ngalanga and C. longa have potential to be developed as alternative anthelmintic drug.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Jerina Khar Yoke Yin": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/208458"}, "Penulis": "Jerina Khar Yoke Yin [11616102]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Neng Fisheri Kurniati, S.Si., M.Si., Apt.", "Dr. apt.
