{"Nomor": 44606, "Judul": "Tsunami geoscience", "Abstrak": "Research in tsunami geoscience has accelerated markedly ever since the tragedy of the\nIndian Ocean tsunami of Boxing Day 2004. Yet, for many decades and centuries, scholars have\nbeen describing a multiplicity of tsunami events. Thus the Royal Society devoted a whole volume\nto the effects of the Great Lisbon earthquake and tsunami of November AD 1755 while in the early\nnineteenth century Charles Darwin was describing the great tsunami at Valdivia, Chile, in his\naccount of the Voyage of the Beagle. Today, research in tsunami geoscience is still fi nding its feet.\nThus, whereas there has been a wealth of publications on the reconstruction of Late Quaternary\nand Holocene tsunamis, the literature describing evidence for tsunamis in the geological record are\nrare. In this paper, we describe how our understanding of tsunamis has changed over time and we\ntry also to identify areas of tsunami geoscience worthy of future study.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Alastair Dawson [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Iain Stewart"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Geology, hydrology & meteorology", "Kata Kunci": "bolides, coastal fl ood risk, offshore earthquakes, submarine slides, tsunami desposits", "Sumber": "Progress in Physical Geography; London Vol. 31, Iss. 6,  (Dec 2007): 575-590.", "Staf Input/Edit": "Yanti Sri Rahayu, S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Okt 2019"}
