{"Nomor": 44893, "Judul": "The Pseudo-Homogeneous Flow Regime In Large-Scale Bubble Columns: Experimental Benchmark And Computational Fluid Dynamics Modeling", "Abstrak": "A precise prediction of the fluid dynamics in bubble columns is of fundamental importance to correctly\ndesign \u201cindustrial-scale\u201d reactors. It is known that the fluid dynamics in bubble columns is related to the\nprevailing bubble size distribution existing in the systems. In this respect, multiphase computational\nfluid dynamic simulations, in the Eulerian multi-fluid framework, are able to predict the local bubble size\ndistributions and, thus, the global fluid dynamics from the fluid flow conditions and by applying\nmodeling closured. In particular, in in \u201cindustrial-scale\u201d reactors, owing to the large gas sparger openings,\nthe \u201cpseudo-homogeneous\u201d flow regimedcharacterized by a wide spectrum of bubble sizesdis typically\nobserved. Unfortunately, reliable predictions of the \u201cpseudo-homogeneous\u201d flow regime are limited up\nto now: one important drawback concerns the selection of appropriate models for the coalescence and\nbreak-up. A set of closure relations was collected at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf that\nrepresents the best available knowledge. Recently, the authors have extended the validation of this set of\nclosure relations to the \u201cpseudo-homogeneous\u201d flow regime, by comparing the numerical predictions to a\ncomprehensive experimental dataset (gas holdup, bubble size distributions and local flow measurements). Unfortunately, the previous study suffers from some limitations; in particular, in the previous\nexperimental dataset, the bubble size distributions concerned only one axial position and a detailed\ncharacterization of the gas sparger was missing. This study contributes to the existing discussion and\nproposed a step ahead in the study of the \u201cpseudo-homogenous\u201d flow regime. To this end, we propose an\nexperimental study, to improve the comprehensive dataset previously obtained. The novel datasetdobtained for two gas velocitiesdconcerns bubble size distributions at different axial and radial\npositions and a precise characterization of the gas sparger. The comprehensive bubble size distribution\ndataset may serve as basis to improve the coalescence and break-up closures; conversely, the precise\ncharacterization of the gas sparger served as an improved input to the numerical simulations. The numerical results, with two different lift force implementations, have been compared with the whole\ndataset and have been critically analyzed. Reasons for the discrepancies between the numerical results\nand the experimental data have been identified and may serve as basis for future studies", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "GIORGIO BESAGNI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Fabio Inzoli", "Thomas Ziegenhein", "Dirk Lucas"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "CFD, Bubble column, Large-scale, Bubble size distribution, Coalescence and break-up, Validation", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 5, Issue 2, Pages 141-160 (June  2019), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2017.12.004", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Nov 2019"}
