The results show that the tool can\nsignificantly reduce the time needed for the data extraction procedure and increase the reliability of\nresults due to the fact that there is no more the need of the human operator. Moreover, during the\ndata extraction phase, the Olga code is available for running different simulations allowing to\noptimize the use of this resource", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "FRANCESCO CARDUCCI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Antonio Del Monaco", "Giancarlo Giacchetta", "Mariella Leporini", "Barbara Marchetti"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Thermo hydraulic simulation, Olga Sensitivity analysis, Pipelines design, Pipelines opimization", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 2, Pages 164-168 (September  2015),    http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.06.003", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Nov 2019"}
