{"Nomor": 41021, "Judul": "NONLINEAR DYNAMICS OFA FGMPLATEWITH TWO CLAMPED OPPOSITEEDGES AND TWO FREE EDGES", "Abstrak": "This paper deals with the nonlinear forced vibration of FGMrectangular plate with a\nboundary of two edges clamped opposite and the other two free. The plate is subjected to transver-\nsal and in-plane excitations. The present research treats the material properties of the FGM plates\nas temperature-dependent and graded continuously throughout the thickness direction, following\nthe volume fraction of the constituent materials according to the power law. The temperature is\nassumed to be constant in the plane and varied only in the thickness direction of the plate. In\nthe framework of geometrical nonlinearity the plate is modeled and the equations of motion are\nobtained on Hamilton\u2019s principle.With the help of Galerkin discretization, the nonlinear ordinary\ndifferential equations describing transverse vibration of the plate are proposed. By the numerical\nmethod, the nonlinear dynamical responses of the FGM plate with two clamped opposite and two\nfree edges are analyzed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Y. X.
