{"Nomor": 46742, "Judul": "DESIGN OF REAR WHEEL SUSPENSION FOR A CITY CAR SHARING VEHICLE", "Abstrak": "Car sharing can be seen as a partial solution for decrease of congestion in cities.\nFor achieving such goal, not only car sharing could be a solution, but vehicle used\nin car sharing system shall match specific requirements. One of such requirements\nis the optimum size of the vehicle, which shall not occupy same space as current\nvehicles in all driving situations \u2013 when parked or when driving at maximum city\nspeeds. Therefore, the vehicle has to be short enough to fit in a single parking\nspace width, and narrow enough to fit two vehicles in single driving lane one next\nto another. Design of the vehicle has to implement some folding-like mechanism,\nwhich would allow shortening overall vehicle\u2019s length when parked but will not\nnegatively influence vehicle\u2019s stability when driving. Perform a literature research\naiming on visions of small city vehicles including but not limited to powertrain,\npackage, driving specifics and suspension design. Design a concept of rear driven\nsuspension powered by an electric motor with focus on i.e. folding the vehicle\ninto smaller parking space, while maintaining acceptable driving characteristics in\nspeeds up to 100 km/h. This thesis consists of research on small city vehicles and\nprototypes, calculations of longitudinal dynamics of a vehicle and design\ncalculations of a foldable rear suspension system. It also includes a CAD model of\nthe rear suspension made in Catia V5 and dynamic tests in CarMaker.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Petr Vacha [23117704]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Satrio Wicaksono, S.T., M.Eng., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Mesin", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "electric car, suspension, mechanical design, vehicle dynamics, foldable car", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "D.
