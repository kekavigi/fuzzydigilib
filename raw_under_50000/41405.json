{"Nomor": 41405, "Judul": "Macroecology, geographic range size\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdbody size relationship and minimum viable population analysis for new world carnivora", "Abstrak": "Macroecology deals with variation and covariation of complex variables, such as body size, population density and geographic range size (GRS), measured across species at broad spatial scales. Despite the increasing number of papers in this field, little attention has been given to the links between patterns at different scales. In this paper, we analysed the constraint envelope formed by the macroecological relationship between GRS and body size for 70 species of New World terrestrial Carnivora. The lower-right constraint line of this envelope is usually interpreted as the minimum viable GRS that keeps extinction risks relatively low across evolutionary time, and in this paper we fitted this line by multiplying average home range size (established by allometric equations) by different minimum viable population sizes, establishing a minimum viable GRS....", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jose Alexandre Felizola Diniz-Filho [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Priscilla Carvalho, Luis Mauricio Bini"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Macroecology; Geographic range size; Home range size; Extinction; Minimum viable population size", "Sumber": "ScienceDirect, Acta Oecologica 27 (2005) 25\u201330", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Agu 2019"}
