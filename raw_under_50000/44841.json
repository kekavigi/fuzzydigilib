{"Nomor": 44841, "Judul": "Numerical Analysis Of Non-Newtonian Rheology Effect On Hydrocyclone Flow Field", "Abstrak": "In view of the limitations of the existing Newton fluid effects on the vortex flow mechanism study,\nnumerical analysis of non Newton fluid effects was presented. Using Reynolds stress turbulence\nmodel (RSM) and mixed multiphase flow model (Mixture) of FLUENT (fluid calculation software)\nand combined with the constitutive equation of apparent viscosity of non-Newtonian fluid, the\ntypical non-Newtonian fluid (drilling fluid, polymer flooding sewage and crude oil as medium) and\nNewton flow field (water as medium) were compared by quantitative analysis. Based on the\nresearch results of water, the effects of non-Newtonian rheology on the key parameters including\nthe combined vortex motion index n and tangential velocity were analyzed. The study shows that:\nnon-Newtonian rheology has a great effect on tangential velocity and n value, and tangential velocity decreases with non-Newtonian increasing. The three kinds of n values (constant segment)\nare: 0.564(water), 0.769(polymer flooding sewage), 0.708(drilling fluid) and their variation amplitudes are larger than Newtonian fluid. The same time, non-Newtonian rheology will lead to the\nphenomenon of turbulent drag reduction in the vortex flow field. Compared with the existing\nformula calculation results shown, the calculation result of non-Newtonian rheology is most\nconsistent with the simulation result, and the original theory has large deviations. The study\nprovides reference for theory research of non-Newtonian cyclone separation flow field.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "LIN YANG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jia-Lin Tian", "Zhi Yang", "You Li", "Chuan-Hong Fu", "Yong-Hao Zhu", "Xiao-Lin Pang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "Non-Newtonian rheology, Cyclone separation, Key parameters, Turbulent drag reduction, FLUENT", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 1, Pages 63-67 (March  2015),      http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.05.001", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Nov 2019"}
