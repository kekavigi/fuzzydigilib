{"Nomor": 41102, "Judul": "Investigation Of Wax Precipitation In Crude Oil: Experimental And Modeling", "Abstrak": "In this work, a series of experiments were carried to investigation of rheological behavior of crude\noil using waxy crude oil sample in the absence/presence of flow improver such as ethylene-vinyl\nacetate copolymer. The rheological data covered the temperature range of 5e30 C. The results\nindicated that the performance of flow improver was dependent on its molecular weight. Addition\nof small quantities of flow improver, can improve viscosity and pour point of crude oil. Also, an\nArtificial Neural Network (ANN) model using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) topology has been\ndeveloped to account wax appearance temperature and the amount of precipitated wax and the\nmodel was verified using experimental data given in this work and reported in the literature. In\norder to compare the performance of the proposed model based on Artificial Neural Network, the\nwax precipitation experimental data at different temperatures were predicted using solid solution\nmodel and multi-solid phase model. The results showed that the developed model based on\nArtificial Neural Network can predict more accurately the wax precipitation experimental data in\ncomparison to the previous models such as solid solution and multi-solid phase model with AADs\nless than 0.5%. Furthermore, the number of parameters required for the Artificial Neural Network\n(ANN) model is less than the studied thermodynamic models.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "TARANEH JAFARI BEHBAHANI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ali Akbar Miran Beig", ", Zahra Taheri", "Bahram Ghanbari"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Wax precipitation, Artificial neural network, Solid solution model, Multi-solid phase model", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 3, Pages 223-230 (September  2015), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.07.007", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Jul 2019"}
