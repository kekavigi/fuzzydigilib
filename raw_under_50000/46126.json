{"Nomor": 46126, "Judul": "REACTION-BASED FLUORESCENT PROBES FOR THE DETECTION AND IMAGING OF REACTIVE OXYGEN, NITROGEN, AND SULFUR SPECIES", "Abstrak": "This Account describes a range of strategies\nfor the development of fluorescent probes for detecting\nreactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species\n(RNS), and reactive (redox-active) sulfur species (RSS).\nMany ROS/RNS have been implicated in pathological\nprocesses such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, cancer, diabetes\nmellitus, cardiovascular disease, and aging, while many RSS\nplay important roles in maintaining redox homeostasis, serving\nas antioxidants and acting as free radical scavengers.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Luling Wu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Adam C.
