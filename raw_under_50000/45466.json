LEAVES, CENTELLA ASIATICA LEAVES AND ITS COMBINATION ON WHITE BLOOD CELL AND PLATELET LEVEL OF FEMALE SWISS WEBSTER MICE", "Abstrak": "Background and purpose : Dengue fever is characterized by a decreased level of\nplatelet in the blood. Carica papaya L. and Centella asiatica have been used\nempirically to cure dengue fever. Aim : The aim of this study was to examine the\nactivity of aqueous extract of Carica papaya L. leaves, Centella asiatica leaves\nand its combination on the blood platelet level of female Swiss Webster mice.\nMethod : Mice were divided into 7 groups consists of one group for negative\ncontrol, and the remaining groups being administered orally with various extract\nconcentration of Carica papaya L., Centella asiatica and its combination for 3\ndays consecutively. Platelets were count using a Hematology Analyzer. Results :\nThe combination of the extracts which showed a positive effect on the platelet\nincrement were the combination of high dose of Carica papaya L. - high dose of\nCentella asiatica and a positive effect on the increase of white blood cell count.\nHigh dose of Carica papaya L. (50mg/20g) showed a steady increase in the\nplatelet count, and showed significant difference compared to the negative\ncontrol, whereas Centella asiatica did not have an effect on the platelet activity of\nthe mice. Conclusion : Aqueous extract of Carica papaya L. leaves at dose of\n50mg/20g mouse bw has the highest platelet increment, suggesting that the extract\nprobably can be used as an alternative treatment for dengue fever.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Veenoth A L Kanapathy": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/193195"}, "Penulis": "Veenoth A L Kanapathy [10710708]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Neng Fisheri Kurniati, S.Si., M.Si., Apt."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sains dan Teknologi Farmasi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Farmasi", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Dengue fever, thrombocytopenia, Carica papaya L., Centella asiatica, hematology analyzer.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Des 2019"}
