{"Nomor": 45195, "Judul": "Energy of the 229Th Nuclear Clock Isomer Determined by Absolute ?-ray Energy Difference", "Abstrak": "The low-lying isomeric state of 229Th provides unique opportunities for high-resolution laser\nspectroscopy of the atomic nucleus. We determine the energy of this isomeric state by taking the absolute\nenergy difference between the excitation energy required to populate the 29.2-keV state from the ground\nstate and the energy emitted in its decay to the isomeric excited state. A transition-edge sensor\nmicrocalorimeter was used to measure the absolute energy of the 29.2-keV ? ray. Together with the\ncross-band transition energy (29.2 keV ? ground) and the branching ratio of the 29.2-keV state measured\nin a recent study, the isomer energy was determined to be 8.30  0.92 eV. Our result is in agreement with\nthe latest measurements based on different experimental techniques, which further confirms that the\nisomeric state of 229Th is in the laser-accessible vacuum ultraviolet range.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "A.
