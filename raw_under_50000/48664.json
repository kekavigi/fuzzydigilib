{"Nomor": 48664, "Judul": "PURIFICATION OF CRUDE SALT AS AN EFFORT TO OBTAIN PHARMACEUTICAL GRADE SODIUM CHLORIDE CANDIDATE (NACL)", "Abstrak": "As a country that has a fairly extensive coastline, Indonesia has great potential as a salt producer in\nthe International market. However, in Indonesia salt are currently produced by home industries in\nsmall scale and hence cannot be expected to meet the high quality standard of food or pharmaceutical\ngrade salt. This research is conducted to establish an appropriate method for the production of\npharmaceutical grade NaCl candidate at laboratory scale. The process of the purification of local crude\nsalt includes filtration, addition of adsorbent and precipitating agent, pH adjustment, addition of\nchelating agent and recrystallization. The adsorbent and the precipitating agent used were active\ncarbon and sodium carbonate, while sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid were used to adjust pH.\nThe purified salt then undergoes several tests for the specifications according to the procedures\ndescribe in the Indonesian Pharmacopoeia 5th edition. The result shows that the sample has fulfilled\nall the requirement except for limits of arsenic and volatile organic compound (not determined).\nHowever in the case of volatile organic compound, data from the previous study using similar\npurification method is available, in which the level of this impurities is not greater than permissible\nlevel. For arsenic, considering that other metal impurities have been effectively removed, it is assumed\nthat arsenic can also be removed applying this procedure. Based on overall results, it was concluded\nthat the appropriate method for the production of pharmaceutical grade NaCl candidate at laboratory\nscale was successfully obtained.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Siti Firdah Tussolihah": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/208489"}, "Penulis": "Siti Firdah Tussolihah [10716101]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr.rer.nat.
