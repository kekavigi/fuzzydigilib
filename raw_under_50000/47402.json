{"Nomor": 47402, "Judul": "MODELING & SIMULATION OF STEWART PLATFORM MECHANISM WITH ROTARY ACTUATION SYSTEM", "Abstrak": "Development of aircraft simulator has started since 1910 and has come a long\nway since it began. The development has increases significantly because of the\ncomputational technolgy has developed and computing time and calculation for\nequations become much faster. Flight Physics Research Group ITB is one to\nparticipate in developing through several research activities. In this research a\nsimulation of a motion platform, an important part of aircraft simulator, is done\nusing SimScape which is provided in MATLAB. This research is to see the\nresponse of a motion platform called Stewart platform or hexapod manipulator as\na motion cue. The simulation uses uses several aircraft motions to be tested. The\nsimulation also see the response of both open-loop and closed-loop system.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Teresa Nirmala": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/206580", "BAB 1 Teresa Nirmala": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/206581", "BAB 5 Teresa Nirmala": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/206585", "PUSTAKA Teresa Nirmala": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/206586"}, "Penulis": "Teresa Nirmala [13615009]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
