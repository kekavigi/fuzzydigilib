{"Nomor": 40361, "Judul": "PERENCANAAN SISTEM DRAINASE BANDARA ADI SOEMARMO-SURAKARTA", "Abstrak": "Adi Soemarmo airport is one of the international airport located in Surakarta, Central Java. This airport has 200 hectare of area including 37 hectare from its landside and 163 hectare from its airside. The identification shows that the airport is really close to the Pepe River which only separated 300-500 meters away. So, the authority of Adi Soemarmo airport needs several analysis to make sure Pepe River will not flooding the airport which can disturb the airport operational activities. Moreover, the internal drainage system also has to be consideration to avoid excess puddle inside the airport.\nThe flood potential caused by Pepe River will be analyized using 25 year return period of rainfall. Then, the total rainfall will be converted to effective rainfall by adding infiltration parameter which determined by horton formula. The effective rainfall will be delivered into three formulas of peak discharge, namely der Weduwen, Haspers, and Melchoir equation also three unit hydrograph analysis using Snyder, SCS, and Nakayasu. Based on the mentioned methods, the peak discharge is 303 m3/s. The capacity of Pepe River can be determined by seeing its cross section plan. The cross section data is obtained from DEMNAS website which generated by Global Mapper. From the flood analysis, Pepe River will reach the maximum discharge at +121,8 above sea level.\nThe airport drainage system is divided into two areas, i.e. landside and airside. The drainage design is following the criteria which stated in national standar code SNI 2415:2016 and also guideline of drainage design from Direktorat Jenderal Cipta Karya and Bina Marga. The steps of designing a drainage system are hydrology analysis, channel capacity design (dimensioning), and channel structural analysis. Channel section uses for the landside is rectangular u-ditch section while airside uses trapezoidal section. The drainage system completed by tunnel waterway measuring 1500x1500. The design will be verified by using SWMM to identify the the flood probability. This application uses time history concept, so the user can observe the channel response by seeing its capacity through the time.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Dimas Yoga Pratama Jubaedi [15015008]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Andhika Sahadewa, S.T., M.S.E., Ph.D.", "Joko Nugroho, S.T., M.T., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Sipil", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Sipil dan Lingkungan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Hidrologi, hujan, debit rencana, saluran drainase, jaringan drainase, banjir.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "9 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Jul 2019"}
