{"Nomor": 46150, "Judul": "UNRAVELLING THE IMPACT OF CALCIUM CONTENT ON THE BIOACTIVITY OF SOL?GEL-DERIVED BIOACTIVE GLASS NANOPARTICLES", "Abstrak": "Sol?gel-derived bioactive glass nanoparticles (BGNs)\nare fascinating materials for bone regeneration. In the literature, it can\nbe found that their specific surface area and their calcium content\n(Ca/Si ratio) are the two key parameters impacting strongly the\nparticles\u2019 bioactivity. Nevertheless, in most studies, in vitro bioactivity\ntests are performed on a series of materials where both the\ncomposition and the specific surface area are varied. It is thus\ndifficult to unravel the effect of each parameter independently. In this\nstudy, spherical and monodispersed BGNs with different Ca/Si ratios\nand a similar specific surface area have been synthesized by a\nmodified Sto?ber method in order to specify the impact of the calcium\ncontent only. The mineralization studies performed in simulated\nbody fluid showed that the bioactivity increases with the amount of calcium incorporated in the glass matrix. However, this effect is not significant in the composition interval studied (7?15% mol of CaO). Such a result proves that the effective Ca/Si ratio is not the major parameter that affects the bioactivity of sol?gel binary BGs. In vitro biocompatibility assessment during 3 and 7 days using human mesenchymal stem cells in contact with the sample showing the fastest mineralization proved its noncytotoxicity. Hence, biomedical applications can be intended for this sample.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xavier Kesse [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Charlotte Vichery, Aurelie Jacobs, Ste?phane Descamps, and Jean-Marie Nedelec"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "bioactive glass, nanoparticles, sol?gel, bioactivity, composition", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Feb 2020"}
