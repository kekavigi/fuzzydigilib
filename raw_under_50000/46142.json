{"Nomor": 46142, "Judul": "REVEALING INTERMOLECULAR HYDROGEN BONDING STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS IN A DEEP EUTECTIC PHARMACEUTICAL BY MAGIC-ANGLE SPINNING NMR SPECTROSCOPY", "Abstrak": "Liquid forms of pharmaceuticals (ionic liquids and\ndeep eutectic solvents) offer a number of potential advantages over\nsolid-state drugs; a key question is the role of intermolecular\nhydrogen bonding interactions in enabling membrane transport.\nCharacterization is challenging since high sample viscosities, typical\nof liquid pharmaceutical formulations, hamper the use of\nconventional solution NMR at ambient temperature. Here, we\nreport the application of magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR\nspectroscopy to the deep eutectic pharmaceutical, lidocaine\nibuprofen. Using variable temperature MAS NMR, the neat\nsystem, at a fixed molar ratio, can be studied over a wide range\nof temperatures, characterized by changing mobility, using a single\nexperimental setup. Specific intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions are identified by two-dimensional 1H?1H NOESY and ROESY MAS NMR experiments. Hydrogen-bonding dynamics are quantitatively determined by following the chemical exchange process between the labile protons by means of line-width analysis of variable temperature 1H MAS NMR spectra.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Sarah K.
