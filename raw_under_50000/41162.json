{"Nomor": 41162, "Judul": "Reliability Analysis Of Lan Chengyu Corroded Pipeline With Associated Defects", "Abstrak": "Traditional reliability evaluation method for corroded pipeline exists the problem of not considering the associated defects. We therefore propose a new calculation method considering the\nassociated defects. In this paper, the traditional and new methods are respectively used to calculate\nand contrastively analyze the failure probability of corroded pipeline; we then perform the research\nof residual life prediction for the corroded pipeline, followed by the sensitivity calculation of all\nrandom evaluation parameters. And then the Monte Carlo method (MCS) is applied to verify the\nrationality of the new method. The research results show that: the method considering associated\ndefect is more objective, and truly react corroded pipeline's dynamic reliability changes; obtain\nnew method to predict residual life of corroded pipeline; corrosion depth, radial corrosion rate have\na significant impact on reliability of corroded pipeline considering associated defects. The calculation results of the method are more accurate, more time-saving", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "QIN LI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Chunmei Sun", "Zhiqiang Huang", "Xiang Xiao", "Haiping Thang", "Shiying Zhao"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Industrial oils, fats, waxes, gases", "Kata Kunci": "Corroded pipeline, Associated pipeline, Reliability analysis, The remaining life, Sensitivity", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 1, Issue 3, Pages 244-250 (September  2015), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2015.07.006", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Jul 2019"}
