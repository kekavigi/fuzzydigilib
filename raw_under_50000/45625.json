The current trend in research on anticancer\ndrugs is to exploit particular traits or hallmarks unique to cancer cells. Among all the hallmark\nof cancer, the acquisition of unlimited replicative potential is a key step to ensure expansive\ntumour growth. Xanthone derivatives, such as 1-hydroxyl-3-aminoalkoxy xanthone\nderivatives have been proved having anticancer activity towards various cancer cells\nespecially human gastric cancer (HGC) cell in which involved the activity of human\ntopoisomerase II beta enzyme. The aim of the present research was to design xanthone\nderivatives as novel anticancer compounds based on Quantitative Structure Activity\nRelationship (QSAR) methods. Molecular structures were built using Gauss View 5.0.8 and\noptimized using Gaussian 09W software. The pharmacochemistry properties were calculated\nusing MOE 2009.10 and multilinear statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics\n21.0. The validation was conducted by Leave One Out method. The designing of new\nderivatives were done by using Topliss scheme based on QSAR equation. The new derivatives\nwere then docked into human topoisomerase II beta enzyme using AutoDock 4.2 software to\npredict their interactions. The best QSAR equation obtained was Log IC 50= 39.587+ (6.540 x\nDensity) + (4.849 x AM1_HOMO) + (-0.603 x AM1_LUMO) + (-0.010 x LogS). There were\n15 new compounds which were predicted having lower IC50 compared to the lead compound\nbased on QSAR equation. Seven derivatives have better free binding energy, and one\ncompound of 3-[3 (diethylamino) propoxy]-1-hydroxy-9H-xanthen-9-one shows the best\naffinity (the value of free binding energy was -5.03 kcal/mol ) to Human topoisomerase II-beta\nenzyme. Among all the compound, 3g(1) is the prospective novel xanthone derivatives for\nfurther study.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Ravindran Parasuraman": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/195046"}, "Penulis": "Ravindran Parasuraman [10712766]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof..
