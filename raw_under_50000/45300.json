{"Nomor": 45300, "Judul": "Fault-tolerant protection of near-term trapped-ion topological qubits under realistic noise sources", "Abstrak": "The quest of demonstrating beneficial quantum error correction in near-term noisy quantum processors can benefit enormously from a low-resource optimization of fault-tolerant schemes, which are specially designed for a particular platform considering both state-of-the-art technological capabilities andmain sources of noise. In this work we show that flag-qubit-based fault-tolerant techniques for active error detection and correction, as well as for encoding of logical qubits, can be leveraged in current designs of trapped-ion quantum processors to achieve this break-even point of beneficial quantum error correction. Our improved description of the relevant sources of noise, together with detailed schedules for the implementation of these flag-based protocols, provide one of the most complete microscopic characterizations of a fault-tolerant quantum processor to date. By extensive numerical simulations, we provide a comparative study of flag- and cat-based approaches to quantum error correction, and show that the superior performance of the former can become a landmark in the success of near-term quantum computing with noisy trapped-ion devices.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "A.
