{"Nomor": 46120, "Judul": "IN-CELL NMR IN HUMAN CELLS: DIRECT PROTEIN EXPRESSION ALLOWS STRUCTURAL STUDIES OF PROTEIN FOLDING AND MATURATION", "Abstrak": "Cellular structural biology methods are\nneeded to characterize biological processes at atomic\nresolution in the physiological environment of the cell.\nToward this goal, solution in-cell NMR is a powerful approach\nbecause it provides structural and dynamic data on macromolecules\ninside living cells. Several approaches have been\ndeveloped for in-cell NMR in cultured human cells, which are\nneeded to study processes related to human diseases that rely\non the delivery of exogenous macromolecules to the cells. Such\nstrategies, however, may not be applicable to proteins that are sensitive to the external environment or prone to aggregate and can introduce artifacts during protein purification or delivery.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Enrico Luchinat [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Lucia Banci"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "an In-Cell NMR, Protein Folding and Maturation", "Sumber": "American Chemical Society (ACS)", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Feb 2020"}
