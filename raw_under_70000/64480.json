{"Nomor": 64480, "Judul": "MANGOSTEEN PEEL-DERIVED CARBON-BASED ELECTROCATALYST IN RECHARGEABLE ZN-AIR BATTERY", "Abstrak": "Due to the increasing demand for clean and sustainable energy, Zn-air batteries have\ngreat potential for future large-scale applications due to their safety, high energy density, and\nlow cost. Somewhere along the line, related issues with electrocatalysts have hampered Znair\nbattery development. An electrocatalyst is a crucial part of electrically rechargeable Zn-air\nbatteries to improve the kinetics of ORR and OER. Presently Pt, Ir, and Ru are needed to act\nas electrocatalysts. But Pt, Ir, and Ru are pricy and still burdensome.\nIn this research, activated carbon from mangosteen peel has been successfully\nsynthesized and applied as a carbon-based bifunctional electrocatalyst in Zn-air batteries. The\nmanufacture of carbon-based electrocatalysts begins with KOH activation followed by a\npyrolysis process. The carbon-based electrocatalyst attained the onset potential of 0.85 V for\nORR activity, the overpotential of 1.2 mA/cm-2 for OER activity, and 110 mW/cm-2 for peak\npower density stable 525 cycles for 175 hours in the practical Zn-air batteries application. The\ngood result shows mangosteen peel-derived has the potential as a carbon-based electrocatalyst\nin rechargeable Zn-air batteries. Nevertheless, the development might be improved by adding\nsome doping to enhance the performance.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Adiska Nur Safira": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246960"}, "Penulis": "Adiska Nur Safira [13717059]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Lia Amelia Tresna Wulan Asri, S.Si., M.Si., Ph.D.", "Afriyanti Sumboja, Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Material", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Zn-air battery, bifunctional electrocatalyst, biomass mangosteen peel.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "8 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Mei 2022"}
