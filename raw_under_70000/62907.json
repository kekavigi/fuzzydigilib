It can be gathered through packer test and slug test. The high cost of the operational implementation of these tests lead to the limited availability of observational-based distribution of hydraulic conductivity data. Highly fractured rocks in Grasberg open pit mining and surrounding of PT Freeport Indonesia (PTFI) result in fractured-groundwater-flow media. It is related to the complex geological structure and lithological condition. Groundwater modeling needs 3D distribution data such hydraulic conductivity (K). On previous research, hydraulic conductivity is distributed homogenyneously at each layer model. In this paper, under limited observational hydraulic conductivity, isotropic hydraulic conductivity will be modeled based on the HC-System approach and will be three-dimensionally distributed using Artificial Neural Network (ANN). HC-System approach will be developed according to the packer test and slug test measurement using\ngeotechnical data from drilling such as Rock Quality Designation (RQD), Lithology Permeability Index (LPI), Depth Index (DI), and Gouge Content Index. HC-System approach will be resulted in isotropic distribution of hydraulic conductivity. It is then checked at some points by the packer tests and slug tests observational data. It is further very beneficial for modeling of groundwater distribution flow with the heterogeny hydraulic conductivity.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Tedy Agung Cahyadi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/241828", "2015 TEDY AGUNG CAHYADI 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf?_": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/241829", "2015 TEDY AGUNG CAHYADI 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf\niu": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/241830", "2015 TEDY AGUNG CAHYADI 1-PAPER.pdf5?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/241831"}, "Penulis": "Tedy Agung Cahyadi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Lilik Eko Widodo, Irwan Iskandar, Sukaerang, Suyono"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "hydraulic conductivity, modeling tree dimensional (3D) distribution, neural network (NN), HC-System", "Sumber": "https://osf.io/preprints/inarxiv/u5ey7/", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Jan 2022"}
