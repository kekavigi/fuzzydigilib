{"Nomor": 63697, "Judul": "A DECISION LOOP FOR SITUATION RISK ASSESSMENT UNDER UNCERTAINTY: A CASE STUDY OF A GAS FACILITY", "Abstrak": "This paper presents a decision-making support system for situation risk assessment associated with critical alarms conditions in a gas facility. The system provides a human operator with advice on the confirmation and classification of occurred alarm. The input of the system comprises uncertain and incomplete information. In the light of uncertain and incomplete information, different uncertainties laws have been associated with the probabilistic assessment of the system loops which combine data of several sources to reach the ultimate classification. The implemented model used Observe-Orient-Decide-Act loop (OODA) combined with Bayesian networks. Results show that the system can classify the alarms system.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Antar Simohammed [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Rachid Smail"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "OODA loop; Bayesian networks; Decision making; Situation risk assessment; Uncertainty; Information; Alarms system; Emergency", "Sumber": "Petroleum, Volume 7, Issue 3, 2021, Pages 343-348, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405656121000043", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Feb 2022"}
