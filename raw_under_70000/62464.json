{"Nomor": 62464, "Judul": "TECHNO-ECONOMIC STUDY OF IMMISCIBLE CO2 INJECTION WITH DIMETHYL ETHER APPLICATION", "Abstrak": "Indonesia is committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2060. Indonesia is still facing the challenge of Current Account Deficit, caused by the high import of energy. At the same time, Indonesia has a large supply of domestic resources that could be utilized. One of the efforts being attempted is performing the gasification of coal, turning it into Dimethyl Ether (DME) to reduce the dependency of LPG imports. The technology of Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage is also applied to reduce the carbon emission and also help Enhanced Oil and Gas Recovery to increase the production of Indonesia\u2019s oil and gas. The DME Development Cooperation Agreement Amendment was also signed by Pertamina, PTBA, and APCI, to ensure that the coal gasification project continues to reduce the dependence on imports of Liquid Petroleum Gas.\nIn this study, we conducted a study on a DME plant, injecting CO2 to thirteen oilfields, applying Immiscible CO2 Injection. Carbon pricing and PSC Cost Recovery is implemented to determine if it helps the project\u2019s economy. Certain parameters are tampered with to determine what it would demand to achieve a positive economy for the contractor.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Reynaldo Dati": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240488"}, "Penulis": "Reynaldo Dati [12216018]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Steven Chandra, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "CO2, Immiscible CO2 Injection, Carbon Pricing, Cost Recovery", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "06 Jan 2022"}
