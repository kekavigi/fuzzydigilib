The accurate calculation of dynamic evolution of stress field is important for the\ndesign of fracturing and infill wells. The extraction of gas flow results in stress-sensitive and significantly alters\nthe original in-situ stress field, which brings difficulties on geomechanical design for fracturing treatment.\nHitherto, the main factors that affect the principal stress alteration is unclear, especially when considering the\ninterference between fractures and wells. Besides, the transport mechanisms of shale gas flow are complex, which\nbring difficulties in the modeling of deformable multi-continuum. In this paper, an adaptive model that couples\nmulti-continuum matrix and discrete fractures is developed. According to the effective stress coefficients of\nmatrix pores and natural fractures, the total deformation is decomposed into two parts: matrix pore pressure\ndepletion induced deformation and natural fracture pressure depletion induced deformation. The model is then\nvalidated to simulate hydromechanical coupling processes in fractured-shale reservoirs during the production\nperiod. Sensitivity analysis of stress alteration is also performed to study the alteration angle of the minimum\nhorizontal principal stress during production. The modeling results show that the pressure depletion in natural\nfractures is the fastest, which dominates the shale deformation. Besides, the gas desorption in organic matters\nenlarges the alteration angle of the minimum horizontal principal stress during production. Finally, we find the\ndifference between adsorption rate and desorption rate, instead of the total adsorbed gas amount, determines the\nadsorbed gas production.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yunhu Lu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Shiming Wei", "Yang Xia", "Yan Jin"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Shale gas; Geomechanics; Multi-continuum; Stress alteration", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 196,\u00a0January 2021, 107576, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920410520306446", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Jan 2022"}
