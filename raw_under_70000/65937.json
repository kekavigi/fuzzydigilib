{"Nomor": 65937, "Judul": "NUMERICAL ANALYSIS AND OPTIMIZATION OF TORSIONAL CRUSHING BEHAVIOUR OF MULTI-CELL THIN-WALLED COLUMN", "Abstrak": "Transportation has become an important part of human life. In the means of\nincreasing the safety and efficiency of transportations, most of today's vehicle uses\na spaceframe structure configured in a thin-walled lightweight structure that can\nabsorb the energy of an impact through a progressive buckling, bending collapse,\nand also torsional collapse. This research's primary objective is to design and\noptimize a thin-walled column structure with a multi-cell cross-section subjected to\ntorsional loading to improve its crashworthiness performance. This research studies\nthe influence of multi-cell cross-section on the torsional crushing performance of\nthin-walled columns and estimates the optimum configuration with respect to\nspecific initial torsional crushing and specific energy absorption performance.\nThe base model of the thin-walled column is obtained from the previous\nstudy. The thin-walled column is modified into several variations with\nconfiguration based on the L16 orthogonal array. The optimum configuration is\nthen estimated using Taguchi\u2019s Robust Parameter method and the influence of the\ncontrolled variable on the system performance is analyzed using the ANOVA\nmethod. The results show that the optimum configuration for specific initial\ntorsional crushing and specific energy absorption performance is multi-cell 2 (M2), 4.5 mm thickness, 85 mm width, 270 mm length, and AA6061 T6 thin-walled\ncolumn material. From the ANOVA method, it is determined that material is the\nmost influential parameter and cross-section comes in second for both specific\ninitial torsional crushing and specific energy absorption performance.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Akhdan Fakhri": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250333"}, "Penulis": "Akhdan Fakhri [13617023]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
