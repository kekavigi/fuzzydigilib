{"Nomor": 62298, "Judul": "EXPLORING SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE TO IDENTIFY RARE EARTH ELEMENT-BEARING MINERALS ASSOCIATED WITH ALLUVIAL TIN DEPOSITS", "Abstrak": "The mapping of potential rare earth elements (REE) areas is important to meet increasing demand, thus, making innovation in mineral exploration necessary. As a fast, non-destructive mapping method, reflectance spectroscopy shows strong promise. It is known that the reflectance spectra signature for REE-bearing minerals can be\nidentified in the visible near-infrared (400\u20131100 nm) range. This research aimed to implement reflectance spectroscopy for the identification of REE-bearing minerals in samples from several alluvial tin mines in South Bangka, Indonesia. Reflectance spectroscopy was carried out for samples consisting of alluvial tin deposits,\ntailing, and concentrates. Furthermore, the samples were divided into 3 differently sized fractions: +48, +100, and -100 mesh. The spectral reflectance data were acquired using the spectroradiometer, and REE concentrations were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer analysis. REE-bearing minerals, such as\nmonazite and xenotime, were more commonly found in the tailing and concentrate samples, while a small amount was identified in the alluvial samples. The spectral analysis showed that wavelengths of 748 nm, 803 nm, and 872 nm can be related to REE, and they are also found to be suitable with remote sensing imagery of Sentinel-2, which indicates a capability of the image to detect REE-bearing minerals.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Muhammad Anugrah Firdaus1": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/239879", "DAFTAR Muhammad Anugrah Firdaus1": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/239880", "2020 MUHAMMAD ANUGRAH FIRDAUS 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/239881", "2020 MUHAMMAD ANUGRAH FIRDAUS 1-PAPER.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/239882"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Anugrah Firdaus1 [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Arie Naftali Hawu Hede, Syafrizal, and Mohamad Nur Heriawan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "rare earth element, reflectance spectroscopy, tin deposits", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani \u00a0\n                                     Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Des 2021"}
