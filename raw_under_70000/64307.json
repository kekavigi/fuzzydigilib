{"Nomor": 64307, "Judul": "OPTIMIZATION OF NET PRESENT VALUE USING MANAGED WATER LOOP ALGORITHM", "Abstrak": "Downhole Water Loop (DWL) and Downhole Water Sink (DWS) are two methods which used to reduce the effect of water coning or cresting in vertical well oil producer. They control bottom water coning by draining water from lower perforation, below Water Oil Contact (WOC). The main difference between them is that DWS produces the drained water to surface while DWL directly injects the drained water to lower completion in the same aquifer. Therefore, DWL method has the better reservoir pressure conservation.\nIn real and simulation case, producing oil using either DWS or DWL method will eventually end up in bottom water coning, even if produced at critical oil rate, water will slowly accumulate and the cone height will increase. Changing the water rate will affect the change of cone height. Moreover, at some point, high water rate could reduce the cone height. So the cone height accumulation can be slowed down by applying high and low water rate alternately.\nThis study was made by using water rate management for DWL smart well; algorithms for determining missing parameter of either high and low water rate, water-rate-change time, and oil rate by using semi-analytical breakthrough time and stabilizing cone time prediction. Reservoir model has been generated to validate the method and evaluate the result. Rough calculation for Net Present Value (NPV) difference between conventional well and DWL smart well is presented as well, considering oil recovery and additional cost in applying DWL method.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Mochamad Luthfan Fauzi Akbar": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246335"}, "Penulis": "Mochamad Luthfan Fauzi Akbar [12208001]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
