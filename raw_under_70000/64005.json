{"Nomor": 64005, "Judul": "PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BY BIM IN TRANS SUMATERA TOLL ROAD CASE STUDY:  SIMPANG INDRALAYA \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd PRABUMULIH SEGMENT", "Abstrak": "PT Hutama Karya (Persero) (PT HK), which one of the Indonesian State-Owned Company (SOE)\nthat was assigned to operate the Trans Sumatra Toll Road (JTTS), has implemented Building\nInformation Modeling (BIM) for construction control in terms of Cost, Quality, and Time since\n2021. The Indralaya \u2013 Prabumulih intersection is one of the projects implementing BIM, which is\nexpected to be a solution for completing this 65 km project. However, there are still inconsistencies\nin its implementation, as evidenced by the assessment carried out from January 2021 to October\n2021, where achievements above 100% occurred in the first five months. However, starting from\nthe sixth month, a decline of 83% began. This condition continued until the 10th month when the\nscores were below 100%, and some were even below 75%. It is necessary to evaluate the\nperformance of BIM implementation at PT HK and find the alternative to improve performance of\nBIM Implementation. \nThe cause of the implementation of BIM at PT HK, which has not reached the expected target, is\ndue to several obstacles, namely the making of the DED 3D model image using BIM is slow, the\n3D model shop image is not following the development schedule, and the BIM infrastructure\ncannot be implemented properly. Based on the analysis, several dominant problems must be\nresolved, namely standard procedures that are not following conditions in the field, a corporate\nculture that has not placed BIM as important and has not been able to adapt to technology quickly,\nand a new company has developed a KM system so that the transfer of BIM knowledge has not\ngone well. \nThe proposed alternative solution is to eliminate Non Value Added Activity by making a Business\nProcess Modeling Notation (BPMN) for making shop drawings, changing culture with the\nADKAR concept and choosing a Knowledge Management System with the Analytic Hierarchy\nProcess. The proposed alternative solution is expected to improve the performance of BIM\nimplementation in PT HK.", "Daftar File": {"2022_TS_PP_Ni Putu Oki Wirastuti_1-Abstrak.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/245206"}, "Penulis": "Ni Putu Oki Wirastuti [29120311]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr.Eng.
