{"Nomor": 67702, "Judul": "ANALISA INDIKASI EXCESSIVE RISK-TAKING DAN PANDEMI COVID-19 TERHADAP NON PERFORMING LOANS/FINANCING PADA BANK KONVENSIONAL DAN BANK SYARIAH DI INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "Banks are one of the important sectors in supporting the progress of the\ncountry's economy, so bank performance must be well maintained. One of the\nparameters that can measure a bank's performance is through Non-Performing\nFinancing/Loans (NPF/NPL), which can determine the efficiency of management of\nloan funds provided by the Bank to customers (Haneef, Rana, & Karim, 2012). The\nCovid-19 pandemic, which attacked various sectors and weakened economic growth,\ncould increase the number of non-performing loans (NPF/NPL) in the banking\nindustry (CEIC Data, 2021).\nProblems regarding the increasing number of non-performing loans/financing\n(NPF/NPL) for the banking industry could be caused by excessive risk-taking. The\nproblem of excessive risk-taking cannot be observed directly, but this problem can be\nseen by observing the behaviour of banks in taking excessive risks in lending.\nTherefore, research is needed to analyze the indications of excessive risk-taking and\nCovid-19 in conventional banks and Islamic banks in Indonesia, leading to\nnon-performing loans. The author's research aims to find out whether there are\nindications of the Covid -19 pandemic. The author implements a threshold regression\nmodel to detect excessive risk that leads to moral hazard indications. This kind of\nresearch has been previously conducted by Novellini & Ulpah (2017), which shows a\nmoral hazard in lending behavior by Bank Indonesia. Novellini & Ulpah (2017)\nadopted the methodology applied by Zhang et al. (2016), who conducted a similar\nstudy with Bank data in China. These studies show that Covid-19 Pandemic\nSituations have a positive and significant correlation with the NPL/NPF ratio. Beside\nthat, there are no conventional banks and Islamic banks that are indicated to carry out\nexcessive risk taking in this study.\nKeywords : Excessive Risk-Taking, Moral Hazard, NPL, NPF, Bank", "Daftar File": {"2022 SK TARREQ KEMAL AL IDRUS-ABSTRACT.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/256990"}, "Penulis": "Tarreq Kemal Al Idrus [19019173]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Taufik Faturohman, S.T., MBA, Ph.D.", "Khrisna Ariyanto, S.T., M.T.", "Oktofa Yudha Sudrajad, S.T., M.S.M., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Excessive Risk-Taking, Moral Hazard, NPL, NPF, Bank", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Wiwik Istiyarini", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Agu 2022"}
