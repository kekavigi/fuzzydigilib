{"Nomor": 64137, "Judul": "IDENTIFIKASI FAKTOR-FAKTOR PENGHAMBAT IMPLEMENTASI LEAN CONSTRUCTION DI INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "The construction industry in Indonesia is experiencing very rapid growth in line\nwith the increasing infrastructure budget issued by the government, the\nconstruction service industry is also increasing from the demand side, this\nopportunity must be followed by development and improvement in its execution both\nin the planning and construction processes, so that benefits can be obtained.\nmaximally. In order to increase productivity and efficiency, many countries are\nimplementing lean construction which has been proven to provide various benefits.\nIn Indonesia, research and socialization have been carried out since the 2000s but\nuntil 2021 only a few companies have implemented lean construction, therefore the\npurpose of this study is to identify what factors are the barriers to construction\ncompanies in Indonesia in implementing lean construction.\nData was collected by distributing questionnaires to six state-owned construction\ncompanies that have implemented lean construction. The results of data processing\nshow that 77.78% of the projects carried out by respondents have implemented lean\nconstruction with the most widely used tools being the Last Planner System (LPS),\nthe majority of companies have only implemented lean construction for two years\nand 69.64% of respondents stated that the application of lean construction is more\nfinancially beneficial. and non-financial. From the calculation of the Relative\nImportance Index (RII), technical factors related to design complexity, lean\nphilosophy, application of lean construction tools, and technical capabilities of\nhuman resources rank first and become the main barriers for construction\ncompanies in implementing lean construction. By comparing similar studies from\nseveral countries, it is known that technical problems tend to be the main barriers\nin countries that are just starting to implement lean construction, while countries\nthat have been implementing lean construction for a long time are more related to\nsocial factors.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Muhammad Usman Al Fahmi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/245449"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Usman Al Fahmi [25018304]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
