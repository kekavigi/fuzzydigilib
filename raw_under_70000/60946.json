{"Nomor": 60946, "Judul": "PENGHEMATAN BIAYA IMPOR MINYAK MENTAH MELALUI UTILISASI UNIT FLOATING STORAGE (STUDI KASUS: PT. MITA ZULU)", "Abstrak": "Indonesia currently still have 250 thousand barrels per day deficit of crude oil supply, which are being fulfilled by import. The domestic crude oil production is forecasted to decline significantly, whereas there is an ongoing progress of upgrading the existing refinery capacity, therefore in the future the volume of crude oil import shall also increase significantly. With the current refinery capacity of 1 Million Barrels per days, PT MITA ZULU spends around 9 Billion USD of imported crude oil in 2018. The value of import crude oil shall also increase with the increase of supply deficit. Therefore, a rigorous evaluation on crude oil import activity and the exploration of other possible logistic optimization that could reduce the cost of import with the utilization of Floating Storage Unit are being analyzed.\n  External and internal factor which could affect current business condition have been evaluated by using PESTLE framework. Internal factor had been analyzed using the VRIO framework to identify competitive advantage. Porter\u2019s five forces are being used to analyze further business competition and strategic positioning. Technical and commercial aspect that will determine the favorable scheme of logistic optimization of crude oil import have also been considered.\n The cost-benefit analysis of the utilization of Floating Storage Unit is using assumption period using the typical contract period of 3 year. The cost saving that is projected to be achieved in the end of period is around +/- 50 Million USD. Sensitivity analysis uses the scenario of additional Floating Storage Unit and the fluctuation of oil price. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the project is more sensitive to crude oil prices.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Muhammad Ismail Rendhi Prakoso": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/267087", "BAB 1 Muhammad Ismail Rendhi Prakoso": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/267088", "BAB 2 Muhammad Ismail Rendhi Prakoso": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/267089", "BAB 3 Muhammad Ismail Rendhi Prakoso": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/267090", "BAB 4 Muhammad Ismail Rendhi Prakoso": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/267091", "PUSTAKA Muhammad Ismail Rendhi Prakoso": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/267092"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Ismail Rendhi Prakoso [29319390]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Widhyawan Prawiraatmadja, M.A., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Administrasi Bisnis", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Crude Oil, Refinery, Import, Floating Storage, Investasi, Analisa Sensitifitas", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Roosalina Vanina Viyazza", "File": "6 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Sep 2021"}
