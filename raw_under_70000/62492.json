The accurate estimation of steam chamber expansion over the entire life of the SAGD process is very\nimportant to forecast its performance correctly. In this study, the concave parabola steam chamber geometry\nanalytical model is expanded to include the rise and confinement stage of SAGD. Based on Darcy\u2019s law and\nmaterial balance, analytical models in the rise and confinement stage of the steam chamber were established to\nestimate the oil production rate with time respectively. The energy balance is then used to estimate the SOR for\ndifferent stages. The developed analytical models for different stages of SAGD are combined to obtain a\ncomprehensive multi-stage model. The model is then validated against the experimental data obtained by Cheng\nand Butler and a numerical simulation with CMG-STARS. The comparison proves that the newly proposed model\nis more accurate than the previous model. After verifying the accuracy of the proposed model, some important\nproduction indicators of the SAGD process in different stages, such as oil production rate, cumulative production\nand effective height, and energy analysis during different stages of the SAGD process are discussed respectively.\nThe influence of different parameters on the whole process of SAGD is discussed finally. The model proposed in\nthis paper is significant for guiding the actual development of SAGD process in oil fields.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yunfei Guo [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Huiqing Liu", "Yabin Feng", "Xiaohu Dong", "Wei Zheng"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Steam chamber growth, SAGD Comprehensive model, Concave parabola interface geometry", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering,Volume 208, Part A, January 2022, 109321", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Jan 2022"}
