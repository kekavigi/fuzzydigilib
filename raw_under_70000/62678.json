{"Nomor": 62678, "Judul": "GEARBOX DESIGN OF A 10 KW ARCHIMEDEAN SCREW TURBINE AT 1.25-M OF HEAD AND 1 M3/S OF DISCHARGE CONDITION LOCATED NEARBY THE CONDENSOR DISCHARGE AREA OF A STEAM POWER PLANT", "Abstrak": "Archimedean screw machines have been used for pumping purposes for thousand of years. In the last century, a number of researchers have produced patents for utilizing the machine as to work as a hydro turbine. The turbine can potentially be installed at nearby the condenser discharge area of a steam power plant, considering that there is a high discharge of water with safe temperature for seawater biotas. However, the design of such a turbine requires additional criteria compare to that of ordinary screw turbine, it must have high corrosivity resistance.\nThis project focuses on designing the screw turbine system which consists of the flights, torque tube, turbine mantle, end plate, and power transmission system.The turbine is design to be applied at 1.25 meter of head and 1 m3/s of discharge.\nThe calculations give a screw turbine of 10.6 kW of turbine power output, 1.84 meter screw outer diameter, 0.92 meter inner diameter, and 2.5 meter screw length. The power transmission system utilizes gearbox consists of 3-stage single-helical gears with total ratio of 45:1. The generator chosen for generating electricity is a 12kW, 1500 rpm, 3-phase synchronous AC generator from Minsun.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Dinan Fadhlurrafi Fauzi Anwari": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/241334"}, "Penulis": "Dinan Fadhlurrafi Fauzi Anwari [13116121]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr.-Ing.
