From litelature3 it is known that CO2-foam is more efficient than WAG (Water Alternating Gas) and continuous CO2 immiscible injection method.\nThe objective of the study is to find and compare the oil recovery efficiency by using CO2-foam, CO2-WAG (Water Alternating Gas), and continuous CO2 immiscible injection method. The study uses synthetic oil field which is built into the CMG Stars simulation software. The three models developed are one dimensional porous medium model, two dimensional areal model, and two dimensional vertical model. These models will be used to find the components of recovery efficiency, namely, displacement, vertical, and horizontal efficiency.\nThe simulation results in the form of oil recovery factor for each method. Total oil recovery factor is composed of the efficiency values of displacement, vertical sweep, and horizontal areal sweep efficiency. The highest total efficiency is reached by CO2-foam injection method which is at 14.56% for 2 PVI (Pore Volume Injection) compared with WAG-CO2 (Water Alternating Gas) and continuous CO2 immiscible injection method. It is because foam can reduce the mobility of CO2 gas so that it prevents earlier breakthrough of CO2 gas to the production well. It also improves sweep efficiency by reducing gas channeling on continuous CO2 injection method. From the simulation result we also conclude that at condition in which CO2 supply is limited, CO2-foam injection method produces higher oil recovery in comparison with WAG (Water Alternating Gas) injection method.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Rendra Saputra": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/235644"}, "Penulis": "Rendra Saputra [12210072]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
