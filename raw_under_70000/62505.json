{"Nomor": 62505, "Judul": "AN INTEGRATED ROCK-MECHANICS TESTS AND NUMERICAL MODELLING OF CHALK ROCKS: AN IMPROVED INTEGRATED WORKFLOW FOR BOREHOLE SAFETY", "Abstrak": "Fluid withdrawal and pore pressure reduction change the effective stresses around a borehole and cause\nborehole instability associated with progressive localization of the damaged zone as well as potential fines\nproduction. Experimentally, chalk exhibits a complex geomechanics behaviour (pore collapse, shear failure,\ntime/rate dependency) and modelling the behaviour of the borehole under in-situ and operational conditions\nrequires the constitutive model to be capable of capturing the observations. This study presents a workflow\nthat integrates rock mechanics testing on cylindrical specimens as well as specimen with a single lateral hole\n(SLH) and a finite element code, developed for chalk. The code incorporates post-peak softening as well as the\nrate dependency of the pore collapse stress in order to accurately predict the wellbore stability under in-situ\nstress conditions. The tested SLH specimen was CT imaged before and after testing for identifying the damaged\nzone and its extension. Backward numerical simulations of the SLH test data improved the accuracy of the\nestimated rock mechanics properties (post-peak failure and dilatancy) compared to the properties estimated\nby back analyses of standard triaxial tests with a single element simulator. The workflow is applied to predict\nthe stability of a small lateral borehole (2 cm) created with Radial Jet Drilling technique with two different\ngeometries: one with circular geometry created by a rotating nozzle; another with a circular hole with wing\nshaped cracks likely to develop when a static nozzle is used. Results of the wellbore stability analyses applying\nthe chalk properties from the back analyses highlighted the importance of using experimentally verified postpeak\nfailure and dilatancy parameters, together with a modelling tool capable of simulating shear strain\nlocalization incorporating the Cosserat approach.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "M.K.
