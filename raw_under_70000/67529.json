{"Nomor": 67529, "Judul": "APLIKASI MODEL MATERIAL BALANCE UNTUK PERAMALAN PRODUKSI SHALE OIL DENGAN INJEKSI SOLVENT HUFF-AND-PUFF", "Abstrak": "Primary Oil Recovery in shale-oil reservoirs is currently a major concern of the oil industry. This is because the shale-oil reservoir tends to have a low Recovery Factor. This study was conducted to estimate the performance of a shale-oil reservoir injected with methane gas using the huff-and-puff method using the material balance equation. For huff-and-puff gas injection, the average reservoir pressure is calculated after injecting a certain amount of gas during the huff period, which uses Newton-Raphson iterations until a convergent pressure value is obtained. In addition, each huff-and-puff cycle is calculated the remaining OOIP as well as the volume of gas injected. Based on the simulation results, it shows that the recovery from the shale-oil reservoir increases due to the increase in pressure after the injection of methane gas which causes the oil production to increase.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Radifan Ahmad Surya Cendekia": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/256531"}, "Penulis": "Radifan Ahmad Surya Cendekia [12218030]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
