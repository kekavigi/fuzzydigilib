{"Nomor": 61846, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT OF PROXY MODEL TO PREDICT DOWNHOLE WATER SINK PERFORMANCE IN CHANNELING DELTAIC SAND RESERVOIR WITH WATER CONING PROBLEM", "Abstrak": "In production activities in the oil and gas industry, there are various problem that can appear over time of production. One of the production problem that can appear is the water coning condition in the production of oil wells in the reservoir which has a driving mechanism strong water drive. Where the condition of water coning in the production well will interfere with the production activities by increasing the water cut value of the well and reducing the oil production of the well. To maintain the water coning problem, several methods have been applied such as perforating the oil wells far from the initial water-oil contact depth ,maintain the production well rate below the critical rate value, or using the polymer-gels water shut-off technology by make a water-blocking zone around the well using injected crosslinking polymer or gels. However, these methods do not give the best result to maintain the water coning problem and even create other problems in oil production activities. Until the Downhole Water Sink (DWS) method is applied which is more effective in maintaining the water coning problem where the DWS method will create a counterbalance pressure drawdown below the water-oil contact level or in the water column of the reservoir that will inhibit the formation of water coning and will increase the cumulative oil recovery of a well. In determining the optimal DWS of a well, an approximation is taken in this study using proxy model analysis that resulting an equation to obtain the maximum cumulative oil that can be obtained.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Emirza Rivardi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/236911"}, "Penulis": "Emirza Rivardi [12217001]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
