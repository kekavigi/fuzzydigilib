{"Nomor": 63645, "Judul": "OIL ORIGINS, MIXING AND BIODEGRADATION IN SOUTHWESTERN JUNGGAR BASIN, NW CHINA", "Abstrak": "The southwestern Junggar Basin is an attractive region for oil exploration. A major discovery of high oil production rate from a recently drilled borehole stimulated a new round of extensive petroleum exploration in this region. The potential source beds are within the Permian, Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous and Paleogene strata, but no effective oil-prone source rock samples have been drilled so far due to deep burial, leading to that oil source correlation remains controversial in the region. A total of 38 crude oils and the free, adsorbed and inclusion oils obtained from 18 oil-containing reservoir rocks from the southwestern and southern Junggar Basin were analyzed by GC, GC\u2013MS and GC\u2013IRMS for the purpose to classify oil groups, determine oil origins, and identify effective source beds in sags. Crude oils in the southwestern Junggar Basin can be classified into two end groups and an intermediate group, namely PO, JO and PJO oils, which were originated from the Permian lacustrine source beds, Jurassic terrigenous source beds and both, respectively. Ratios of C19/C20 tricyclic terpanes and C24 tetracyclic/(C24 tetracyclic\u00a0+\u00a0C26 tricyclic) terpanes are the most sensitive parameters to distinguish these three groups of oils. These two ratios increase from PO, PJO to JO oils. JO oils can be further classified into two subgroups, i.e. J1O and J2O. J2O oils have substantially higher amounts of C27 and C28 steranes relative to C29 steranes, higher amount of gammacerane, lower amount of C29 diasteranes, and lower isomerization ratios of steranes, compared with J1O oils. J1O oils were exclusively originated from the Jurassic source beds while J2O oil were mainly originated from the Jurassic source beds mixed with minor oils generated from the Paleogene and Cretaceous lacustrine source beds. In the Chepaizi uplift, the major PO oils and extracted oils from 14 reservoir rocks were mainly originated from source beds within the Lower Wuerhe Formation of Middle Permian (P2w). However, the remaining minor oil samples and extracted oils from the other four reservoir rocks were clearly originated from source beds in the Fengcheng Formation of Lower Permian (P1f) on the basis of molecular parameters and ?13C values of individual n-alkanes, indicating the presence of effective oil-prone source beds within the Fengcheng Formation in the Shawan sag. In shallow reservoirs within the Neogene Shawan Formation (N1s), PO, PJO and J1O oils are severely biodegraded while J2O oils have nearly no biodegradation effect because the former entered the reservoirs much earlier than the latter.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Changchun Pan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jun Wang", "Shuang Yu", "Xulong Wang", "Baoli Xiang", "Jiande Liao", "Jiangling Ren", "Ertin Li", "Xuejun Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "biomarkers; C-isotopes; Oil mixing; Biodegradation; Junggar basin; China", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 196, 2021, 108017, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092041052031072X", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Feb 2022"}
