{"Nomor": 63106, "Judul": "MODELING DEVELOPMENT OF MUD DEPOSIT FOR ASSESSMENT OF MUD RUSH POTENTIAL IN BLOCK CAVE MINE", "Abstrak": "Underground mining by means of block caving is often accompanied by mud rush potential due to the development of mud deposit in draw bells that is composed by fine material and water within the cave. Mud rush potential has to be assessed in order to prevent mine failure and accident. It may corelate to wet muck drawing schedule. In order to minimize threat due to mud rush potential, its assessment by means of estimation of mud deposit development need to be conducted. In this paper estimation of mud deposit development was carried out by means of mathematical modeling expressing mass balance of fine material and water in a draw bells. The two mud forming masses were estimated based on insitu inspection and measurement. Mathematical modeling resulted in spatio-temporal distribution of mud deposit that can later on be used to assess the mud rush potential.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Lilik Eko Widodo": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242109", "2014 LILIK EKO WIDODO 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242110", "2014 LILIK EKO WIDODO 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242111", "2014 LILIK EKO WIDODO 1-PAPER.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242112"}, "Penulis": "Lilik Eko Widodo [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Eman Widijanto, Irwan Iskandar, Sudarto Notosiswoyo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "underground mining, block caving, mud rush, mud rush potential, mathematical modeling", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Jan 2022"}
