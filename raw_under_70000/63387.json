The results are that the physical models described in the original paper are clearly incorrect. For the physical model used to explain the axial vibration on a drill string, using a lumped mass-axial spring with damping to model a long slender drill string is not advisable. For the physical model used to explain the torsional vibration on a drill string, using a torsional spring-pendulum with damping to model a long slender drill string is not advisable. The drill string should be constrained in the well bore. As an example, appropriate physical and mathematical models of drill string axial and torsional vibrations are recommended.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zifeng Li [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Drill string; Vibration; Axial; Torsion; Boundary", "Sumber": "Petroleum, Volume 7, Issue 1, 2021, Pages 21-23, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405656119301233", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "03 Feb 2022"}
