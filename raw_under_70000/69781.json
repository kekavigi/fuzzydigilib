{"Nomor": 69781, "Judul": "APPLICATION OF VERY FAST SIMULATED ANNEALING ALGORITHM FOR TIME-LAPSE MICROGRAVITY", "Abstrak": "Almost any type of gravity inversion modeling suffers from\nthe problem of non-uniqueness, especially in time-lapse\nmicrogravity problem. The uncertainty can not be\ncompletely reduced because in general the inverse problem\nof geophysics is usually non-linear, so using linear\nalgorithm can not find optimal solution. In this research, we\npresent non-linear inversion using a very fast simulated\nannealing method to find out the spread of density changes\nmade in the reservoir. Our technique has been applied to\nsynthetic data and proven can be identify the location of\ndensity contrast at the reservoir.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Adi Nugroho Setyo Utomo", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Darharta Dahrin, Dr. Susanti Alawiyah"], "Jenis Koleksi": "", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Application of Very Fast Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Time-Lapse Microgravity", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Devi Septia Nurul", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Nov 2022"}
