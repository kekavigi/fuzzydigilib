{"Nomor": 64358, "Judul": "ISOLATION, CHARACTERIZATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF MICROORGANISM FROM LEMBANG SOIL", "Abstrak": "Bacteria are large domains of prokaryotic microorganisms. Aerobic bacteria are those that need oxyaen, so where soil is well drained aerobes tend to dominate. Anaerobes are bacteria that do not need oxygen and may find it toxic. This group includes very ancient types of bacteria that live inside soil aggregates. Anaerobic bacteria favor wet, poorly drained soils and can produce toxic compounds that can limit root growth and predispose plants to root diseases. Tanah Lembang (Lembang soil) in west java in tropical area is abundant in microorganism population which has not been identified. The aim of this study was to identify microorganism from Lembang soil. The soil collected from Lembang, sample is diluted up to 10  serial dilution. Mac Conkey is specifically for gram negative bacteria such as E.coli. Enterobacter sp and Klebsiella sp. The Vogel Johnson agars are normally for gram positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus which form characteristic black colonies. The Enterococcus faeccalis produced blue colonies in the agar. Meanwhile, Pseudomonas agar for Pseudomonas aueroginosa produced green colonies. Thus, for Xylose Lysine Deoxycholate agar which is for bacteria such as Salmonella sp produced red colonies and black centers and Shigella sp produced colonies. The catalase test was to determine the whether the bacteria produce catalase or not. The microorganism was tested with biochemical test with triple sugar ion test and IM Vic (Indole, Methyl red, Voges Proskauer and Simmon citrate) test. The microscopic test was done to each microorganism that has been isolated. The microorganism isolated from soil was tested for its antimicrobial activity with other microorganism. The results from the research revealed that the soil of Lembang consist Penicillium sp (fungus), Enterobacter sp and Staphylococcus aureus. Voges Proskauer showed a positive reaction by giving reddish brown color to the VP broth and Simmon citrate which changers the color from green to blue both indicates presence of Enterobacter sp. The microscopic test for fungus resulted in genus Penicillium sp. The black colony that formed on Vogel Johnson agar and catalase test gave a positive reaction indicates the presence of Staphylococcus aureus. Bacillus cereus showed zone of inhibition against all the bacteria that has been isolated from soil. However, it did not showed zone of inhibition against fungus from soil.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Moganraj Rajoo": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246441"}, "Penulis": "Moganraj Rajoo [10708734]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Marlia Singgih, Ph.D.", "Dr. rer. nat.
