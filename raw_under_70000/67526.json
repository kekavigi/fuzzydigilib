Physical characteristic differences between layers rose a challenge of production optimization for each layer by avoiding the fluid transportation between layers phenomena which generally called the crossflow phenomena. A case study is done for a multilayered gas well with different physical characteristics to identify the appearance of the crossflow phenomena on the optimum production operation point based on nodal analysis methods to then optimization possibilities are discussed using the Downhole Interval Control Valves (ICVs) tool. The result of this study suggests review of currently producing multilayered gas wells.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Novrian Harits Firmansyah": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/256529"}, "Penulis": "Novrian Harits Firmansyah [12218014]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
