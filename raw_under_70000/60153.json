{"Nomor": 60153, "Judul": "APLIKASI CAPACITANCE-RESISTIVE MODEL (CRM) UNTUK MNGEVALUASI PERFORMA SUMUR INJEKSI PADA LAPANGAN KERBAU.", "Abstrak": "One of the key to improving understanding of reservoir under waterflood is establishing connectivity among various injectors and producers. The tools for establishing connectivity are developed to optimize the performance of injection.\nThe traditional approach of reservoir simulation is based on the continuity equation and Darcy\u2019s law for fluid flow through porous media. Because of the number of required input data, traditional reservoir simulation studies may take months to set up and days to complete one computer run. The old geological data might no longer valid because of the change of the rock properties during the past production. The research and testing of new geological data must be conducted and give us more time to start the simulation.\nCapacitance-Resistive Model is a model based on the correlation about the effects of changing the injection rate to the production rate. The model is an input-output model concentrated on describing the relationship between injectors and producer by modeling total fluid production from reservoir. The only needed data is injection rates and total production rates to history match the model and obtain the connectivity between injector and producer.\nThis study describes the application of Capacitance-Resistive Model to the Kerbau waterflooded field in the Central Sumatera Basin. The objectives of this study was to show that the CRM can be used, along with some techniques to provide a representation of reservoir condition, especially the connectivity between wells, which can then be used to do some recommendation for improving the waterflood performance in Kerbau Field.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Theoza Nopranda": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/234214"}, "Penulis": "Theoza Nopranda [12210064]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
