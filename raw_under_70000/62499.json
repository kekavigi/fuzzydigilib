{"Nomor": 62499, "Judul": "OPTIMIZING THE RESOURCES MODEL OF \"HORSE SHOE\" CU-AU PORPHYRITIC DEPOSIT USING UNFOLDING GEOSTATISTICAL METHODS", "Abstrak": "One of the largest Cu-Au porphyritic deposits in Indonesia has a folded geometric like \"horse shoe\" due to the presence of last barren intrusion around the central part of orebody. The \"horse shoe\" folded geometric will generate not optimum resource model in term of producing high error and local variability in Cu-Au grades, because the spatial distribution of data points is not regular. In this research we try to transform the spatial distribution of all points data in 3D into an unfolded geometric by using two methods, rotation and projection matrices. The unfolded geometric will generate more regular data point. So the variography analysis as well as geostatistical estimation and conditional simulation on Cu-Au grades will be performed both in rotation and projection unfolded geometries. These results were compared to the ones in original form as folded geometric in order to recognize the improvement of unfolded transformation results.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Mohamad Nur Heriawan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240681", "2015 M NUR HERIAWAN 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240682", "2015 M NUR HERIAWAN 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240683", "2015 M NUR HERIAWAN 1-PAPER.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240684"}, "Penulis": "Mohamad Nur Heriawan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["INDARTO, ABDILLAH, AGUS HARIS WIDAYAT, and ANTON PERDANA"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "\"horse shoe\", Cu-Au grades, unfolding, Ordinary Kriging, Sequential Gaussian Simulation", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Jan 2022"}
