{"Nomor": 63369, "Judul": "WELL TEMPERATURE PREDICTION USING COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS: A CASE STUDY ON GEOTHERMAL WELL \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdA\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd", "Abstrak": "During the production of geothermal wells, there are temperature changes in both the fluid, casing, cement, and formation temperatures due to fluid heat transfer from a higher temperature to a lower temperature in the casing, cement, and formation. This heat transfer also causes a decrease in the temperature of the flowing fluid to the surface. Several heat transfer models have been developed using analytical and empirical methods.\nThis research aims to develop a heat transfer model that occurs with a numerical and two-dimensional approach due to the simplification of the cylindrical geometry model. Through the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach, the heat transfer that occurs follows steady-state conditions to predict the final conditions of heat transfer in the well. Pressure drop, turbulence model, and formation lithology are considered in this study. This research is useful for predicting temperatures propagation which will be used for assessing the integrity of the well.\nThis study discusses production well \u201cA\u201d in geothermal \u201cX\u201d Field, Indonesia. This well has an initial static temperature and pressure profile. The results of this study show that there are temperature differences due to heat transfer by both convection and conduction from production fluid.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Laode Agung Kurniawan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242784"}, "Penulis": "Laode Agung Kurniawan [12217092]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dimas Taha Maulana, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "geothermal, numerical method, temperature distribution, prediction", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Feb 2022"}
