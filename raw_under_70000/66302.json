{"Nomor": 66302, "Judul": "EVALUATING FUTURE OIL WELL INFLOW PERFORMANCE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROPOSED METHOD AND EICKMEIER\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdS METHOD", "Abstrak": "The ability of a reservoir to deliver well fluid decreases over time as a result of the decrease in reservoir pressure due to depletion. The prediction on future of the Inflow Performance Relationship (IPR) becomes necessary to avoid any problems during the production phase. In an unconventional reservoir, the low permeability affects the time for reservoir to reach stabilized time. In practice, a well testing is only carried out maximum of 24 hours. The limited time of well testing causes almost impossible for the reservoir to reach the stabilization time, so that the data obtained are still in a transient condition. Meanwhile, the Eickmeier\u2019s (1968) method for constructing the future IPR curve assumes the data used is in stabilized condition. The equation for predicting the future IPR is proposed by looking at the influence of the results using Eickmeier\u2019s (1968) method in constructing future IPR and then compared with the existing method, such as the Sukarno\u2019s (1986) method.\nThis study mainly discusses about the evaluation of the future IPR by comparing the use of the equation of the proposed method and the Eickmeier\u2019s (1968) method by first calculating the IPR curve in the present condition with transient data. The IPR curve in the present condition was calculated using the method proposed by Liviana in a previous study. Liviana proposed a method to predict stabilized oil well inflow performance relationship in present condition for unconventional reservoir. The obtained Absolute Open Flow (AOF) value will be used in subsequent calculations to construct future IPR curve using the equation of the proposed method and Eickmeier\u2019s (1968) method then compared with Sukarno's (1986) method .", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Tiara Amartya Salsabilla": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250879"}, "Penulis": "Tiara Amartya Salsabilla [12218090]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Amega Yasutra, S.T., M.T.", "Pahala Dominicus Sinurat, S.T., M.Sc."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Transient Data, Future Inflow Performance Relationship, Eickmeier\u2019s Method, Stabilized", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Jun 2022"}
