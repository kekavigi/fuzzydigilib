{"Nomor": 67270, "Judul": "PRESSURE TRANSIENT ANALYSIS ON TWO-PHASE GEOTHERMAL WELL: A CASE STUDY OF TEST DURATION IN WELL \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdX\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd", "Abstrak": "Developing a good well starts with making good plans. In order to make a good plan, we have to understand our reservoir. This will help us prepare for both the production and future development. This includes choosing the appropriate production methods, tools, equipment, and materials to safely produce the well with efficient cost. Therefore, it is important to perform a well test to understand the reservoir properties.\nWell test is conducted to analyze the reservoir. The test analysis determines the reservoir properties, assesses the degree of damage or stimulation, and identifies potential production problems. The longer the testing duration and the higher the number of well tested, the more information we can get. However, this also means more money and time will be allocated for the tests. Having a sufficient but not excessive test duration is needed to appraise more with less cost.\nThis study discusses pressure transient analysis and evaluating the testing time in Well \u201cX\u201d. This analysis consists of determining the period reached during the tests and the wellbore storage, skin, and permeability of the reservoir. Lastly, this study gives a recommendation for future well tests for new wells in the same field.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Ghozyan Maududi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/255950"}, "Penulis": "Ghozyan Maududi [12217006]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dimas Taha Maulana, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "geothermal, well testing, pressure transient analysis", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Agu 2022"}
