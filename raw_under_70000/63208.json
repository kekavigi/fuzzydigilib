{"Nomor": 63208, "Judul": "NATURAL DRAINING MODEL ON SANDY CLAY LOAM SOIL ABOVE IMPERMEABLE LAYER IN MINING OVER BURDEN DISPOSAL", "Abstrak": "Drawdown of groundwater table on mining over-burden disposal field had known will increase the disposal slope stability due to reduction on its inside effective stress. In fact, the drawdown has been happened because of the disposal drainage system and natural draining in dry condition. This paper would like to emphasize influence of natural sun-shining on the drawdown refers to disposal hydraulic parameter through negative-infiltration approach. A role model was running on the disposal layer with sandy clay loam as a study case. Final calculation resulted that it was needed 20 days left for declining the groundwater down to 2.25 meters. This conceptual model was expected to be an option of decision reference for mining\noperational to minimize some unnecessary vertical and horizontal drains.", "Daftar File": {"COVER R A Fajar": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242321", "2018 R A FAJAR 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242322", "2018 R A FAJAR 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242323", "2018 R A FAJAR 1-PAPER.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242324"}, "Penulis": "R A Fajar [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["L E Widodo, T A Cahyadi, A Rinaldi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "drawdown, groundwater, soil disposal, hydraulic parameter, negative-infiltration", "Sumber": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/212/1/012063", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Jan 2022"}
