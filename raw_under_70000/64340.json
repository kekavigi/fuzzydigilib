{"Nomor": 64340, "Judul": "FORMULATION OF TABLET CONTAINING CURCUMIN NANOEMULSION", "Abstrak": "Nanoemulsion containing curcumin had been formulated in previous research. Encapsulation of curcumin in emulsion might increase the bioavailability of the curcumin, and acts to give a better effect. The aim of this study is to formulate tablet containing curcumin nanoemulsion. The formulation of nanoemulsion of curcumin was done by using oil phase: glyceryl monooleate, cremophor RH 40 as surfactant and polyethylene glycol 400 as co-surfactant in the ratio of 1:8:1, and being dispersed in water with mild stirring. Tablet was produced by wet granulation method, using 9% PEG 6000 as lubricant, polyvinylpyrrolidone 5% as binding agent, mannitol as filler, 1% sodium chloride as glidant and 2% sodium lauryl sulphate as lubricant. Nanoemulsion of curcumin with particle size 125.7+ 1.029nm and percentage of drug encapsulated of 99.52% was formed. Tablet containing nanoemulsion of curcumin has good physical characteristics with hardness of 5.95 kg/cm2, curcumin content of 99.76 \u00b10.44 !..tg and 99.79% of curcumin dissolved in 60 minutes. Nanoemulsion of curcumin in the tablet still maintained the particle size of 134\u00b11.45nrn when the tablet was dispersed in water. Curcumin nanoemulsion was able to be formulated into solid dosage form, resulting good physical characteristic of the tablet while maintaining the nanoemulsion form when the tablet was dispersed in water. The comparison of the dissolution profile between tablet curcumin and tablet containing curcumin nanoemulsion should be done to ensure that the tablet formulation using curcumin nanoemulsion is better.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Chew Wei Yee": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246417"}, "Penulis": "Chew Wei Yee [10709704]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. apt.
