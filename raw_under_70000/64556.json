{"Nomor": 64556, "Judul": "EFFECTS OF RAPHANUS SATIVUS L JUICE ON DECREASING THE BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL OF DIABETIC MICE", "Abstrak": "Background and Purpose:Diabetes Mellitus is a condition in the body where the pancreas does not produce enough insulin to process glucose or the insulin receptors are not working properly. In this condition the body would eventually lead to other diseases. The objective of this study is to determine the anti-diabetic effects of the root of Raphanus sativus on blood glucose levels using oral glucose tolerance test and alloxan induced mice methods. Method:The first method is. where the root of R.sativus was juiced using aquadest and it was freeze dried and appropriate amount was dissolved before being administered via oral route to the test animals. Thirty five mice were used in the experiment and they were divided into 5 groups which are normal group, control group, reference group and two test groups. The second experminent where thirty five mice were induced diabetes using alloxan and subsequently the blood glucose level were determine after administration of the extract at day 0, 3, 7, 14 , 17 , 21 and day 28. Aquadest was used as a control and blood glucose levels of each mice were monitored using EasyTouch Glucose strips. Upon completing the experiment, all animals were sacrifice and the pancreas organs were isolated and histology were carried out to observe the regeneration of pancreatic beta cells.Results: Theanimal group treated with 200 mg/kg bw and 400 mg/kg bw of R.sativus juice showed significant ability in maintaining blood glucose levels 30 minutes after administration. In alloxan induced mice, reduction of blood glucose levels were at day 7 until day 28 of administration.In animal group treated with 200 and 400 mg/kg bw R.sativus juice showed improvement in body weight from day 21 until day 28 and from day 14 until day 28 respectively.Conclusion:The juice of R.sativus at the dose of 200 and 400 mg/kg bw posses antidiabetic activity and it showed ability in maintaining and significantly reducing blood glucose levels over a period of 28 day and it also showed improvement in body weight together with improvement of pancreatic beta cells.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Deness Babu": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/247088"}, "Penulis": "Deness Babu [10709705]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. apt.
