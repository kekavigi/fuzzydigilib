Such oscillations may result in unsynchronized and undamped\nsignals. In a multi machine system where all generators must operate in\nsynchronism, undamped oscillations may lead to instability. To overcome this\nissue, this paper proposes a damping control scheme consisting of superconducting\nmagnetic energy storage (SMES) and proportional integral differential (PID)\ncontroller to effectively damp frequency oscillations in multi-machine systems.\nControl parameters of the proposed SMES-PID system are tuned using particle\nswarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Simulation results reveal the effectiveness of\nthe proposed controller in damping the frequency oscillations and maintain system\ndynamic and transient stability during various disturbance events. It is shown by\nsimulation results that PID controller and SMES design can find better quality\nsolution in minimizing overshoot at frequency variations up to 78 % and\naccelerating the settling time up to 67 %. The selection of SMES coil size must be\ncarefully considered due to its high cost. From the simulation results, the SMES\ncoil size of 0.2 H and 2 H are of similar damping effect on power system\noscillations.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Luky Handayani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/263579", "BAB 1 Luky Handayani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/263580", "BAB 2 Luky Handayani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/263581", "BAB 3 Luky Handayani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/263582", "BAB 4 Luky Handayani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/263583", "BAB 5 Luky Handayani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/263584", "PUSTAKA Luky Handayani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/263585", "LAMPIRAN  3  LUKY HANDAYANI": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/263599"}, "Penulis": "Luky Handayani [23218039]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
