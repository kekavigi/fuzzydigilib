ICHSAN SUWANDHI AND HIS HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE IN INDONESIA\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdS BOTANICAL ART", "Abstrak": "Botanical illustration is a very specific field where science and art intertwine. During\nthe XVII century, explorers came to Indonesia to register the archipelago\u2019s natural\nresources. This is when western art techniques and styles slowly started to be\nintroduced in Indonesia. Botanical illustration is still made in academic and artistic\nenvironments, in this research we analyze the current environment of botanical\nillustration and botanical art in Indonesia.\nAs a case study, the illustrations of Dr. Ichsan Suwandhi, were analyzed. He is a\nlecturer from ITB who has been recognized internationally by his botanical\nillustrations. Through interviews and literature review, the original hypothesis was\ntested: The artwork of Dr. Ichsan Suwandhi has both an aesthetic value and scientific\nfunctional value. The function of botanical illustrations in Indonesia has changed\nthrough time but it\u2019s still a necessity.\nThe artwork of Dr. Ichsan Suwandhi was analyzed through Feldman\u2019s theory of art\ncriticism. Suwandhi\u2019s style is categorized as objective accuracy. His art production\nfulfills both aesthetic experiences and a scientific purpose. Although his style is\nrealistic, there are characteristics that make his illustrations different to those from the\nEuropean explorers that initially brought this technique to Indonesia", "Daftar File": {"2022 TS PP CRISTINA RODRIGUEZ SOSA 1.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/256632"}, "Penulis": "Cristina Rodriguez Sosa [27020702]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Nuning Yanti Damayanti, Dipl.Art.", "Dr. Irma Damajanti, S.Sn., M.Sn.", "Dr. Ira Adriati, S.Sn., M.Sn.", "Dr. Willy Himawan, S.Sn., M.Sn."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Seni Rupa Murni", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Seni Rupa dan Desain", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "botanical illustration, botanical art, art history, Indonesian art.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Agu 2022"}
