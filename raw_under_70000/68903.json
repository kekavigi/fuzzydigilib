Development of oil and gas fields are critical to support the growing energy demand. In the process of developing a field, reservoir characterization is critical in order to obtain the necessary knowledge of reservoirs in the field. After characterization, a model is created to forecast the performance of the reservoir and get the knowledge of the reserve that can be produced from the reservoir. One method commonly used is material balance. This method can produce the initial necessary forecast info with the assumption that the reservoir is homegenous and can be represented as one single tank. In this study, material balance is used for predicting a performance of a certain oil reservoir operated by PT Pertamina EP ONWJ.\nThe case used in this study is field X, operated by PT Pertamina EP in the region of Offshore North West Java. Specifically, in one reservoir layer of field X (further describe as field X for simplicity), which is connected to 4 currently producing wells. This reservoir showed compartmentalization into two compartments and its (or their) reserve and production behavior will be asssessed using material balance and with support and check-and-balance from several other methods.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK M.
