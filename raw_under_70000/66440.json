The modeling process started\nfrom micro- to meso-scale level. The microscale level was done by modeling\na hexagonal unit cell under 4 loading conditions, i.e. uniaxial tension,\ntransverse tension, transversal shear, and longitudinal shear, to get a complete\nelastic and damage properties of the unit cell in all modes. The thermoplastic\nmatrix was modeled using Drucker-Prager plasticity and Ductile Damage\nmodel while the fiber-matrix interface was modeled using cohesive element.\nThe effect of fiber volume fraction variation to the damage modes and the\nmechanical properties was also studied. The mesoscale model was built of a\nn\u00d7n homogenized unit cells. The unit cell properties with different fiber\nvolume fractions were distributed randomly across the mesoscale model with\nthe expectation to represent the fiber nonuniformity in the actual composite\nmaterial. It was proved that the proposed mesoscale model could predict the\ncomposite transverse tensile strength with error of 1% compared to the\nexperiment result. The homogenized mesoscale model also had a lower\ncomputational cost compared to another reference model that model the\nheterogeneity of fibers and matrix. It was expected that this simplified method\ncan be used to reduce the number of experiment to estimate the mechanical\nproperties of heterogeneous material.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Khodijah Kholish Rumayshah": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/251135", "BAB 1 Khodijah Kholish Rumayshah": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/251136", "BAB 2 Khodijah Kholish Rumayshah": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/251137", "BAB 4 Khodijah Kholish Rumayshah": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/251139", "BAB 5 Khodijah Kholish Rumayshah": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/251140", "PUSTAKA Khodijah Kholish Rumayshah": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/251141", "BAB 3 Khodijah Kholish Rumayshah": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/251249"}, "Penulis": "Khodijah Kholish Rumayshah [23618001]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
