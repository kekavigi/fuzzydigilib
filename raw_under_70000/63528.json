{"Nomor": 63528, "Judul": "A NUMERICAL HYBRID MODEL FOR NON-PLANAR HYDRAULIC FRACTURE PROPAGATION IN DUCTILE FORMATIONS", "Abstrak": "In this paper, a hydro-mechanical model for non-planar hydraulic fracture propagation in ductile formations is developed based on the Drucker-Prager plasticity theory, Biot's theory and cohesive zone model (CZM). A hybrid extended finite element method (XFEM)-finite volume method (FVM)-embedded discrete fracture model (EDFM) method is proposed for numerical implementation. The XFEM and return-mapping method are used to simulate the deformation of inelastic media with strong discontinuities. The discontinuous pressure field is modelled by the EDFM and FVM. In addition, a dual-layer iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the strong nonlinear systems by a combination of the fixed-stress iteration, Picard iteration and Newton-Raphson iterative method. Then, the accuracy and ability of the proposed model are demonstrated through several reference cases. Finally, the proposed model are applied to two numerical cases and the influences of the plastic deformation on the simultaneous propagation of multi-fractures are investigated.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Wenzheng Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jun Yao", "Qingdong Zeng"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Ductile formation; Non-planar hydraulic fracture propagation; Cohesive zone model; Extended finite element method; Embedded discrete fracture model", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 196, 2021, 107796, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920410520308573", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "16 Feb 2022"}
