{"Nomor": 62122, "Judul": "OPTIMIZATION OF LATTICE STRUCTURE FOR LITHIUM-ION BATTERY PROTECTION SYSTEM UNDERGOING GROUND IMPACT USING MACHINE LEARNING METHOD", "Abstrak": "The motivation to improve the lattice structure core in the battery protection\nsystem is due to some drawbacks in the previous design, which are considered\nnot optimum. This structure is used as the protection system of the Li-\nion battery, which is known as the primary power source in the electric\nvehicle. Li-ion battery has a high risk of fire if deformed too much due\nto high energy density; therefore, protection is needed. Previous research\nhas been done to protect the battery from ground impact, which may cause\nbattery deformation, using a lattice structure. However, it is still too heavy\nand can be improved to achieve a lighter structure without compromising\nthe battery's safety.\nIn this research, the optimization of lattice structure parameters is done\nusing 2 machine learning algorithms: artificial neural network and non-\ndominated sorting genetic algorithm II. Furthermore, the optimum parame-\nters are selected using TOPSIS. The ANN is used to model and predict the\nmass and battery deformation, while NSGA-II is used to find the optimum\nlattice shape parameter. Combining the machine learning algorithms and\nTOPSIS, it is found that the optimum structure shaped is BCC-Z, with the\nporosity of 21.2%, A/B and H/C ratio of 0.7 and 1.17, built using Ti-6Al-4V\nmaterial and stacked 2 times. This configuration results in a mass reduction\nof 17% compared to the existing design while maintaining the battery safety\nperformance in excessive deformation, which may lead to short circuits and\npotential fire.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Leonardus Kenny Pratama": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/238917"}, "Penulis": "Leonardus Kenny Pratama [23620007]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
