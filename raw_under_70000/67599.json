{"Nomor": 67599, "Judul": "ANALISIS PRESSURE, TEMPERATURE, SPINNER (PTS) PADA SUMUR MULTIFASA DI LAPANGAN ULUMBU UNTUK MENENTUKAN KUALITAS FEEDZONE", "Abstrak": "In the development of a geothermal field, it is necessary to determine the characteristics of the reservoir in the\ngeothermal field. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out subsurface measurements. Measurements were made to\ndetermine the condition of the well and its reservoir characteristics. One of these tests is the PTS analysis. PTS is\na test to determine the pressure, temperature, and spinner speed data which will later be interpreted in the form\nof fluid velocity in the well. PTS testing is carried out to determine the depth of the feedzone and their respective\ncontributions when the well is produced.\nThis study describes the stages in conducting PTS testing in determining the feedzone and its quality. This study\nalso describes the modeling of pressure drop carried out along the well flow which is carried out to adjust the\ninterpretation to conditions in the field. PTS testing was carried out in two wellhead pressure conditions, namely\n5 bar and 8 bar. From the results of the analysis, it was found that each of the 3 feedzone depths at each wellhead\npressure was found. At a pressure of 5 bar, three feedzones were obtained, namely at a depth of 402 mMD, 498.6\nmMD, and 871.5 mMD. At a pressure of 8 bar, three feedzones were obtained, namely at a depth of 404 mMD,\n499 mMD, and 870.6 mMD.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Chrisman William Tambunan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/256682"}, "Penulis": "Chrisman William Tambunan [12216031]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dimas Taha Maulana, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "PTS analysis, Pressure, Temperature, Spinner, feedzone,pressure drop.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Agu 2022"}
