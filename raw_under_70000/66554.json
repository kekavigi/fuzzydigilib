{"Nomor": 66554, "Judul": "REFLECTING POETRY: EMPATHISING WITH POEMS AS AN  ALTERNATIVE TO THE CREATIVE PROCESS IN PRODUCT  DESIGN", "Abstrak": "Poetry was mostly introduced to Design as an inspiration for aesthetics. Although there \nhas been no failure in defining poetry as a form of Art that speaks to the human soul, this \ncharacter seems to have been somewhat glossed over because many design research focus \ntheir attention mainly to the objects and the people that would use them. While it is an \nappropriate pursuit of design, it also moves away from what would have been \ntranscendental to the conception of Design, especially if it is steeped in commercial and \ntechnical interests. That is, the insight that may be cultivated from the event of the words \nof poets that land on designers and journey through a private process of creating these \nmeaningful objects. This research attempts to pay attention where it is due as it argues\u2014\nmade visible by previous research on the poetic approach\u2014that poetry in design has \nbecome a necessity. And that a poetry-based design method could be both proof and model \nof the poetics of design. Through an experiment of implementation, this research delves \ninto the proposed method to access this potential by studying the acquaintance of poetry \nand design within the perspective of the creative process. Eventually, it shows how this \ncreative process looks and what it might mean. Theories of metaphoric thinking and \nrevisitation of the common paradigm of design is discussed as both the subject of and \nanswer to the research that is found to harbour in problems of creativity within the design \nprocess. Based on a comparative study on the results\u2014which include reports of \u201cartistic \nfreedom\u201d\u2014it is found that designing based on poetry closely resembles the product of a \nmetaphoric mind, and that this metaphoric mind is rather in need of assistance. Suggestion \nfor the true value of the poetic approach is then concluded: the method may serve as an \nalternative to the more technical creative process of design by way of giving more space \nfor emotion and imagination in leading the design outcome, while simultaneously tending \nto the surfacing problem of a possibly flawed empathy", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Aidafi Arsyi [17516013]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Arianti Ayu Puspita, S.Ds., M.Ds.", "Prof. Imam Buchori Zainuddin"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Desain Produk", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Seni Rupa dan Desain", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "creative process, design method, empathy, metaphor, poetry", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Noor Pujiati.,S.Sos", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Jun 2022"}
