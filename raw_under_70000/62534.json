{"Nomor": 62534, "Judul": "PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION ON THE QUARTZ VEINS AND HOST ROCKS AT THE RIVER REEF ZONE, THE POBOYA GOLD DEPOSIT, CENTRAL SULAWESI, INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "The River Reef Zone is one of mineralization sites outlined in the Poboya Gold Deposit. A previous work suggested that the deposit is classified as a low-sulfidation epithermal deposit. However, characterization of the gold mineralization and its origin still encounters some problematic difficulties. One of the ways to solve them is conducting an investigation on the quartz veins and host rocks. An attempt through petrographic analysis has been carried out to obtain information about the mineralization style. As the results, several rocks were recognized as the host rocks at this zone. Sorted from the surface, the host rocks consist of granitic rocks, biotite-chlorite gneiss, biotite schist intercalated by feldspar porphyroblasts biotite-chlorite schist, and amphibolitic schist. These rocks are cut by various scale of veins composed of quartz-carbonate, quartz, carbonate and quartz-epidote. In order to deepen the understanding on the quartz veins and host rocks, further analyses needs to be done.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Tomy Alvin Rivai": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240872", "2015 TOMY ALVIN RIVAI 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240873", "2015 TOMY ALVIN RIVAI 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240874", "2015 TOMY ALVIN RIVAI 1-PAPER.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240875"}, "Penulis": "Tomy Alvin Rivai [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Kotaro Yonezu, Syafrizal and Koichiro Watanabe"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Pertambangan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "quartz veins, host rocks, petrographic", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Jan 2022"}
