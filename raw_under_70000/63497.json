{"Nomor": 63497, "Judul": "NOVEL HYBRID FAST MARCHING METHOD-BASED SIMULATION WORKFLOW FOR RAPID HISTORY MATCHING AND COMPLETION DESIGN OPTIMIZATION OF HYDRAULICALLY FRACTURED SHALE WELLS", "Abstrak": "This paper introduces a novel hybrid Fast Marching Method-based simulation (FMM-Sim) workflow for rapid history matching and completion design optimization of hydraulically fractured shale wells in unconventional reservoirs. The workflow incorporates fracture propagation to model the injection phase using a 3D finite difference (FD) simulation and seamlessly transitions to FMM-Sim for the subsequent production phase modeling. A simplified physical model for pressure-dependent fracture dilation/compaction was proposed and parameterized to emulate fracture propagation. The model was validated with ABAQUS, a fully coupled fluid flow and geomechanics simulator. In the workflow, the fracture parameters such as fracture geometry and permeability are obtained as a result of the injection phase modeling. Next, they are transferred into the subsequent production phase modeling with FMM-Sim which transforms 3D reservoir simulation model into 1D simulation model leading to orders of magnitude faster computation. The workflow was successfully applied to a field case in the Delaware Basin. The injection and production well data was first history-matched using a genetic algorithm. The calibrated models provide a range of estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) and net present value (NPV) of the history-matched well. After the history matching, the calibrated fracture dilation/compaction curves were used to investigate the optimum completion design for the well. The workflow has been proposed in practical and efficient way in the sense that the entire workflow, from the fracture propagation to the subsequent production, can be performed in any 3D FD simulator. This substantially saves computation resources and manpower compared to common industry workflows. The proposed workflow which connects completion design and hydrocarbon production with efficient computation would be beneficial for field development planning and economic decision making in unconventional reservoirs.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jaeyoung Park [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Atsushi Iino", "Akhil Datta-Gupta", "Jackson Bi", "Sathish Sankaran"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Completion optimization; Rapid reservoir simulation technique; Hydraulic fracture modeling; Shale reservoir", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 196, 2021, 107718, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920410520307828", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Feb 2022"}
