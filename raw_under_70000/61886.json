Limited core sample analysis and manually interpret facies label problems are the\nmotivation to provide this workflow as alternative solution. Start from creating robust supervised machine\nlearning model for predicting formation and facies label using well log data with feature augmentation to improve\nmodel. Each predicted values will be predictor for next target variable in which making integrated workflow.\nImplementing proposed feature augmentation by (Bestagini, Lipari, & Tubar, 2017) and (Marcelo, 2018) to \u201cX\u201d\nfield log data and core analysis data gives 0.91 f1 score in classifying formation and 0.78 f1 score in classifying\nfacies. Prediction of porosity using added features from facies and formation label gives 0.804 R2 score.\nPermeability prediction by transforming train target variable to log values not sufficiently enough to accurately\npredict permeability since it gives only 0.175 R2 score.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Alifian Arief Rachmadinata": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/236970"}, "Penulis": "Alifian Arief Rachmadinata [12217004]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Dedy Irawan, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Facies classification, machine learning, feature augmentation, porosity and permeability prediction", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Sep 2021"}
