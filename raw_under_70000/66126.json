{"Nomor": 66126, "Judul": "ESP PROBLEMS DETECTION USING IMAGE RECOGNITION FEATURE ON AMMETER CHART: A MOBILE APPLICATION", "Abstrak": "One of the optimizations in oil wells is the artificial lift method. An Electrical Submersible Pump (ESP) is one of the common tools in oil wells, especially in offshore. ESP operations are inseparable from the monitoring and troubleshooting process. In troubleshooting, Ammeter chart interpretation is one of the methods used for the early detection of ESP problems. Operators or engineers are the main actors in interpreting the ammeter chart in the power control room to identify problems with ESP. It is to prevent operational problems from becoming a major problem.\nThe ammeter chart is used to measure and record the current drawn by the ESP motor and is a representation of the ESP condition based on the electric current pattern on the chart. Based on the pattern, the ammeter chart is divided into several classes according to the problem in ESP. In this study, the ammeter chart was divided into 15 classes and 49% of ESPs were operating under normal conditions. Some of the problems that occur in this case are gas problems, by 11% and followed by other problems. The interpretation carried out is the starting point for inspection of problems in ESP parts, such as pumps, motors, power supply systems, impellers, diffusers, and other components of ESP.\nTo help operators and technicians who are offshore and to overcome the problem of misinterpretation of the ammeter chart as well as differences in interpretation between operators or technicians, the proposed solution is the creation of software that aims for ammeter chart interpretation efficiently, as well as equalize the interpretation results. A machine learning was created to solve this problem through the construction of the image recognition feature and is used as the basis of this software. Besides that, the mobile application construction is carried out as a user interface that is integrated with programs that have been created.\nThis study discusses the prediction of problems in ESP through ammeter chart interpretation with image recognition-based machine learning programs supported by mobile applications. This study recommends a predictive program model to recognize ammeter chart patterns with an accuracy rate of 89.5% as the best scenario.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Al Rizki Dwi Lanang": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250586"}, "Penulis": "Al Rizki Dwi Lanang [12218056]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Silvya Dewi Rahmawati, S.Si., M.Si., Ph.D.", "Marda Vidrianto S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "ESP, ammeter chart, image recognition, prediction", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Jun 2022"}
