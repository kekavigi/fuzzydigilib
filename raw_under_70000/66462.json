One of the effective stimulation methods to be applied is hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is an operation to frack formations to increase formation productivity.\nIn field \"X\" there are 6 oil wells analyzed which are wells \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", and \"F\". All of these wells have different performances, so it is necessary to select them as candidates for hydraulic fracturing. The most effective method in selecting wells as candidates are to use the methods of increasing the well's productivity index. This is done by comparing the value of the productivity index of the well with the maximum productivity index of the well (when skin = 0) and the maximum productivity index after fracturing (????????????????????????=1.909). The result is that the \"F\" well has the highest potential for increasing the productivity index and is the main candidate for hydraulic fracturing.\nIn the design of hydraulic fracturing, the 2D PKN method is used with the consideration that the \"F\" well has very low permeability and in determining the fracture geometry, the ?????????????? value is assumed so that it is suitable to be applied using the 2D PKN method. After the design is done, an analysis is carried out using fracturing software to confirm the design that has been made. After that, the increase in the productivity index of the \"F\" well can be calculated after the hydraulic fracturing operation is carried out. In this study, the Prats method (1961) and the Cinco-Ley, Samaniego, and Dominiquez (1981) method were used to determining the increase in the productivity index of the well after treatment.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Mochammad Dicky Riza": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/251165"}, "Penulis": "Mochammad Dicky Riza [12218075]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr .
