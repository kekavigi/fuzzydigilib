Furthermore, Indonesia has 530 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions yearly that highly responsible to the present-day concentration of CO2 that leads to climate change. Considering the energy transition era, the world has to use low-carbon emission strategies for the next step in oil industry to optimize oil production while sustaining the means of environmentally friendly solution.\nOne of alternative method is Low Salinity Water Alternating CO2 Gas Injection (LSWA-CO2) as one of hybrid Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) method combining Low Salinity Water Injection (LSWI) and Water Alternating CO2 Gas injection (WA-CO2). LSWI has drawn the attention of the oil industry in the past decade, that can enhance oil recovery by up to 20% compared with conventional waterflooding while CO2 injection has been proven to increase oil recovery and it can reduce carbon gas emissions through CO2 sequestration.\nThis study is aimed to obtain the best scenario by evaluating the co-optimization function involving incremental oil recovery and CO2 storage through modelling varies scenario of LSWA-CO2 by designing CO2 injection rate, low salinity water injection rate, and gas-water injection ratio in \u201cB\u201d structure in \u201cS\u201d field. \u201cS\u201d field is sandstone reservoir with mixed-wet of wettability, and contain clay minerals such as kaolinite and illite. Reservoir simulation and sensitivity study using CMG GEMTM were performed to determine the impact of the designing parameters that contributes to oil recovery and CO2 storage, the trapping mechanism is also observed in the co-optimization scenario.\nThe result of this study shows that highest co-optimization function is achieved at 53.864% by the LSWA-CO2 design having the configuration of 0.05 MMSCFD CO2 gas injection rate; 1,500 BWPD LSWI injection rate; and 1:1 gas-water injection ratio. Accordingly, the optimum scenario can obtain 53.87% recovery factor and stored 17,022.303 ton of CO2, also indicated the occurrence of hydrodynamic trapping, residual trapping, and solubility trapping.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Anggie Fadhilatissalam": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/251027"}, "Penulis": "Anggie Fadhilatissalam [12218024]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
