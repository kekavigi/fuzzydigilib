{"Nomor": 62491, "Judul": "A FRAMEWORK TO OBTAIN THE FORMULAS OF THE CONDUCTIVITY AND APERTURE OF ROUGH FRACTURES UNDER THERMOHYDROMECHANICAL CONDITIONS", "Abstrak": "In this investigation, a framework is proposed to find the equations to describe the fracture conductivity and\nfracture aperture as the functions of effective stress (the difference between geo-stress and fluid pressure),\ntemperature difference (the difference between rock temperature and fluid temperature), and the rock mechanical\nproperties. The framework consists of several lab experiments and a numerical model, which is timesaving\nto study the influences of the aforementioned influential factors on the fracture conductivity and aperture.\nAfter analyzing the lab experimental data, we find that it\u2019s almost impossible to accurately measure the\nfracture aperture even with high-precision displacement sensors. Therefore, the numerical model coupling the\nfluid flow in the rough fracture, the solid deformation, and the heat transfer between the hot rock and the\ninjected fluid is built. Three different distributions of the fracture surfaces are analyzed, and we find that the\nfracture surface roughness fits the normal distribution. After the data matching between the lab experimental\ndata and the numerical results, a large number of numerical experiments using the numerical model are carried\nout to study the influences of the effective stress, temperature difference and the rock properties, including the\nelasticity and Poisson\u2019s ratio. When fitting the single variable analysis results, we find that the fracture conductivity\nand aperture are in different function forms of the aforementioned factors. But the reduction of fracture\naperture and the natural logarithm of the normalized fracture conductivity can be described using the binary\nlinear function of the effective stress and the temperature difference. Two key strengths of the research lie with\nthe fact that it is time-saving to obtain the exact formulas of fracture conductivity and fracture aperture, and it\ncan measure the dynamic fracture aperture accurately.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Shiming Wei [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yan Jin", "Shiguo Wang", "Zhou Zhou", "Yang Xia"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Lab experiments, Numerical experiments, Fracture conductivity, Fracture aperture, Thermohydromechanical conditions", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 208, Part A, January 2022, 109354", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Jan 2022"}
