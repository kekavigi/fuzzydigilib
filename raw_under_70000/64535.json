AGAINST PARACETAMOL INDUCED HEPATIC DAMAGE IN WISTAR ALBINO MICE", "Abstrak": "1-lepatotoxicity is injury to the liver that is related with impaired liver function caused by several issues such as, exposure to a drug or another noninfectious agent. Many factors lead to hepatotoxicity, including disruption of the cell membrane and cell, abnormal bile flow and drug related hepatotxicity. Previous study showed that ethanol extract Pyllanthus emblica alit has been proved to have hepatoprotective effect. The present research was aimed to test its hepatoprotective effect of the aqueous extract of fruit powder in animal model. Phyllanthus emblica fruit was dried and powdered. It was heated with aquadest for 30 minutes, and then it was freeze dried. Hepatotoxicity in mice was induced using paracetamol by oral administration at 1 mg/kg bw. Vitamin C was used as a standard drug which was given 250 mg/kg orally while the fruit extract was given at 100 mg/kg bw and 200 mg/kg bw. The drug was given for eleven days together with the paracetamol. The mice were pre-treated with the extract first, four hours later paracetamol was administered. The Phyllanthus enzblica fruit extract of 2 different doses (100 mg/kg bw and 200 mg/kg bw) and vitamin C (250 mg/kg bw) were able to decrease the level of AST significantly (p<0.05) by 104.26; 104.83 and 113.21 (U/L) respectively. It also decreased the level of ALT significantly (p<0.05) by 44.39; 35.34 and 42.51 (U/L) respectively. Bilirubin level were also decreased significantly (p<0.05) by 0.72; 0.66 and 0.72 (mg/dL).The antioxidant study showed that the fruit extract had a good antioxidant activity when compared with vitamin C as standard. Phyllanthus emblica fruit extract had better effect at a dose of 200 mg/kg bw compared to lower dose of 100 mg/kg bw.", "Daftar File": {"2013 TA PP AARTHI SRI JEGAN.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/247058"}, "Penulis": "Aarthi A P Sri Jegan [10709701]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Kusnandar Anggadiredja, S.Si., M.Si.", "Dr. apt.
