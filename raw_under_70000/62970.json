{"Nomor": 62970, "Judul": "CARBONATE ROCKS RESISTIVITY DETERMINATION USING DUAL AND TRIPLE POROSITY CONDUCTIVITY MODELS", "Abstrak": "The rocks may be classified as Archie rocks or Non-Archie rocks, depending on the link between pore structure and resistivity of the rock. For carbonate rocks, keeping this factor in view, the applicability of Archie's law tends to be unreasonable and employing Archie's equation will ultimately lead to inaccurate estimates of the water saturation. Numerous investigators have reported models that forms a link between laboratory results and field well logs to determine water saturation in intricate pore systems. In case of complex systems, Archie's law fails to correctly define the resistivity-index curves. In addition, it is imperative to carry out investigations at lower saturation values in order to elaborate the non-Archie characteristics. This brings the dual and triple porosity conductivity models into the equation. As these models are essential in defining the considerable changes of the resistivity-index curves, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The linkage between the two models is depicted electrically in series or in parallel. Moreover, it is possible to have a combination of the two configurations. As a result, the experimental results can be modeled accurately using least parameters. This work presents two models to determine water saturation in carbonate rocks, containing dual and triple porosity systems. This study also investigates the impact of different influential parameters such as saturation exponents, conductivity ratios, and pore volume fraction of each network systems, on the new models. Finally, the effect of each parameter is individually studied and the sensitivity analysis on the RI curves is produced. A new approach to apply these models is also explained which requires the use of NMR log, mercury injection capillary pressure (MICP) measurement, and simple plotting techniques to determine the water saturation. The proposed new models help petrophysicists to estimate water saturation in Non-Archie rocks, containing double and triple porosity network systems.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Zeeshan Tariq [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mohamed Mahmoud", "Hasan Al-Youssef", "Mohammad Rasheed Khan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Dual porosity; Triple porosity; Carbonate rocks; Water saturation models", "Sumber": "Petroleum, Volume 6, Issue 1, 2020, Pages 35-42, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405656118301767", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Jan 2022"}
