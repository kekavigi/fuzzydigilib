{"Nomor": 60150, "Judul": "APLICATION OF COMBS METHODS ON X FIELD TO PREDICT AN ACCURATE PORE PRESSURE.", "Abstrak": "One of the first steps in the process of drilling is predicting pore pressure. This is important so that drilling operations running safely, economically, and efficiently. There are various methods for predicting pore pressure, one of which is the d-exponent method . The method has been developed further by Comb, so there is a new method for determining pore pressure.\nCombs method was first used in offshore fields in Louisiana at 1968. Comb\u2019s method is a method to improve drilling rate on the use value of d-exponent to make corrections to the weight on the bit, rotation speed, hydraulics, differential pressure, and the bit wear. Penetration rate decreases with increasing differential pressure as well as the bit\u2019s ability to drill formation. The ability of the bit is affected by the formation penetrated where the longer bit used it will be worn.\nThis study aims to modify the Comb\u2019s method based on the field in Indonesia, which has a different rock lithology field in Louisiana. The parameters of the method will be validated and corrected Combs. Combs modification of this equation very well in determining the value of the pore pressure in the field \"X\" in Indonesia.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Bramantyo Eko Kurnianto": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/234208"}, "Penulis": "Bramantyo Eko Kurnianto [12210031]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr.-Ing.
