{"Nomor": 66282, "Judul": "EFFECT OF IMPURITIES ON CO2 PIPELINE TRANSPORT TO FIELD X", "Abstrak": "As long as fossil fuels are widely used, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) will play a big role in minimizing the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that resulted in temperature rise on earth. Carbon Dioxide (CO2) is considered one of the major pollutants in the atmosphere, so there has to be an action to minimize the CO2 footprints in the atmosphere. CO2 is usually extracted from natural sources such as underground geological formations or it can be a by-product of various combustion processes. One of the solutions for this problem is by transporting CO2 produced by industries to a geological site to be utilized as CO2 storage.\nOne of the most common methods to transport CO2 fluids is by using a pipeline. In field conditions, captured CO2 that flows in pipelines is always impure. The impurities contained in the CO2 fluid have an impact on the properties of the fluid and are quite challenging because impurities that are contained in CO2 have a lot of different impacts, depending on the component contained in CO2. Preliminary studies have shown that the purity of CO2 has a significant effect on pipeline transportation costs, especially at lower flows and longer distances, and on this basis, treating the flow as pure CO2 when performing calculations could be considered not enough.\nThis study consisted of 4 main steps. The first step is to perform fluids modelling for 3 different case of impurities in CO2 fluids, the objective of the first step is to obtain phase envelope for each case. The second step is to design pipeline model and run a simulation, the objective of the second step is to observe the fluids behavior in pipeline. The third step is to make a further development and optimization if there is any error or bad results from third step, the objective of the third step is to make sure the pipeline model has the best results. The final step is to analyze the impact from 3 different case of impurities with comparative study method.\nIn this study, there will be a comparative study of 3 variations of impurities effect contained on CO2 fluids in pipeline transport from an industrial complex in Jurong Island, Singapore to Field X, a depleted giant gas reservoir located in Arun, North Sumatera, Indonesia.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Muhammad Fikri Zharfan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250852"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Fikri Zharfan [12218033]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Silvya Dewi Rahmawati, S.Si., M.Si., Ph.D.", "Ardhi Hakim Lumban Gaol, S.T., M.T., M.Si., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "CO2, pipelines, CO2 impurities, CO2 phase envelopes, compression, fluid velocity, flow assurances", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Jun 2022"}
