{"Nomor": 62403, "Judul": "IDENTIFYING THERMAL FEATURES OF MINERALIZATION ZONES BASED ON THERMAL INFRARED AND XRD ANALYSIS", "Abstrak": "The application of indirect exploration methods such as satellite imagery has been widely used in several studies i.e., in mineral and geothermal exploration activities. The purpose of this study is to develop the mineral mapping techniques by improving the detection accuracy under tropical condition based on multi-spectral Thermal Infrared (TIR) remote sensing. We determined the characteristics of minerals and their alteration zones at Wayang Windu geothermal field (WWGF), West Jawa based on atmospherically corrected ASTER TIR images, field measurements, and XRD analyses. The WWGF is located in Pangalengan and Kertasari sub-districts with a distance 40 km from south of Bandung. The area is situated at Guaternary mountainous range about 1500-2600 m above sea level and composed by andesite basaltic, tuffs breccia, and sandstone with fault strikes northwest - southeast and northeast - southwest. For the purpose of identifying the thermal features at WWGF, we used ASTER TIR image with acquisition date July 29, 2011 at 22:23:09 and 18 May 2003 at 03:18:11. The Thermal Atmospheric Correction and Emissivity Normalization methods were used to generate the brightness temperature and emissivity of ground surface. To have the correlation between thermal features and alteration zones, we combined the extracted brightness temperature and emissivity with the location of alteration zones at field using Band Ratio method. XRD (X-Ray Diffraction) method was used to determine the mineral content\nof some soil and rock samples based on the results of ASTER TIR image analyses. According to our proposed method, we could identify that the alteration zone at WWGF is composed by Advanced Argillic and Propylitic.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Andi Fahdli Heriansyah": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240052", "2018 ANDI FAHDLI HERIANSYAH 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240053", "2018 ANDI FAHDLI HERIANSYAH 1-TABLE OF CONTENTS.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240054", "2018 ANDI FAHDLI HERIANSYAH 1-PAPER.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240055"}, "Penulis": "Andi Fahdli Heriansyah [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Asep Saepuloh, Mohamad Nur Heriawan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Wayang Windu, geothermal field, aleration, X-Ray Diffraction, ASTER TIR", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani \u00a0\n                                     Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Des 2021"}
