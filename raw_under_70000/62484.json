{"Nomor": 62484, "Judul": "CHANGES IN SURFACE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF PYRITE CAUSED BY A BIOSURFACTANT-PRODUCING BACTERIUM: IMPLICATIONS FOR ECO-FRIENDLY BIOFLOTATION REAGENTS IN SULFIDE MINERAL PROCESSING", "Abstrak": "The objective of the current study was to evaluate the use of a novel species of a\nbiosurfactant-producing bacterium Pseudoclavibacter sp. strain SKC/XLW-1 as potential reagents\nfor bioflotation of sulfide minerals (herein pyrite) in order to discover environmentally friendly\nflotation reagents. The bacterial strain was able to change surface chemical properties of pyrite as\nevidenced by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis and hydrophobicity\nmeasurements (contact angle and surface tension). Over the course of the experiment the contact\nangle tended to increase whereas the surface tension was observed to decrease as a function of time,\nsuggesting the possible potential of the strain to function as both frother and collector for flotation\nof sulfide minerals. From the findings of this study it is evident that the bacterium\nPseudoclavibacter sp. strain SKC/XLW-1 can be employed to be a more eco-friendly reagent (both\ncollectors and frother) to facilitate the selective separation of sulfide minerals in the flotation\nprocesses.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Edy Sanwani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240649", "2015 EDY SANWANI 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240650", "2015 EDY SANWANI 1-REVIEWER.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240651", "2015 EDY SANWANI 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240652", "2015 EDY SANWANI 1-PAPER.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240653"}, "Penulis": "Edy Sanwani [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Edy Sanwani, Riria Zendy Mirahati, Siti Khodijah Chaerun"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Biosurfactant; Fe-S-oxidizing bacteria; Bioflotation; Bioreagents", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "5 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Jan 2022"}
