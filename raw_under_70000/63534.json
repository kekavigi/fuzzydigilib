This manuscript proposes several immersive diagnostic paradigms in reservoir engineering. These techniques provide means to understand complex dynamics: when, where, how different processes occur in the subsurface under diverse, realistic conditions. Through the lens of these immersive diagnostics, this study critically investigates reservoirs under WAG injection. Signatures of the proposed diagnostic measures are examined for reservoirs under WAG using four different injection-fluid streams (pure CO2, pure methane, lean gas, and enriched gas) and three WAG injection-cycle strategies in several depositional systems. Due to relatively high content and various scopes, this study appears in two parts. Part I of this study focused on learning the dynamics around the injector under diverse scenarios, whereas Part II explores the impact of reservoir heterogeneity. Immersive diagnostics provide a basis for reservoir tomography under various realistic subsurface and operational conditions. Immersive metrics presented in this study reveal many insightful observations. For example, they can shed light on the extent of the local miscibility in the reservoir settings, profiles of displacement efficiency for contrasting solvents, dissimilarity in the profiles of oil-in-place, and oil saturation. Contrarian views may also emerge using immersive analytics. The immersive analytics reveal phase trapping or banking behavior in oil-in-place, oil diffusivity, and gas-oil mobility ratio profiles around the injector. Dynamics around the injector and the producers can be very contrasting. CO2 and the enriched gas injection yields oil density reduction of 2\u20133 times, and viscosity reduction of about two times more profound into the reservoir, compared to C1 and lean-gas injection with the same injection strategy. Phase trapping or banking behavior appears in oil-in-place, oil diffusivity, and gas-oil mobility ratio profiles around the injector. Dynamics around the injector and the producers can be very contrasting. Late-time behavior of water-oil mobility ratio profiles indicates the compartmentalized nature of the reservoir dynamics, particularly when injecting CO2. For instance, a 5-month gas/1-month water injection strategy resulted in more significant variations in water-oil mobility and gas-oil mobility ratio. In contrast, a 5-month water/1-month gas injection showed less to no compartmentalization behavior. CO2 injection yielded a normal flow than transverse diffusive flow compared to the other injection fluids. The inertial component becomes dominant closer to the producers compared to the vicinity of the injector. The P\u00e9clet number signature indicates that much of the late-time displacement relates to diffusive flow than inertial flow.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Y.
