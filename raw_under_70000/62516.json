{"Nomor": 62516, "Judul": "COUPLED COMPOSITIONAL FLOW AND GEOMECHANICS MODELING OF FRACTURED SHALE OIL RESERVOIR WITH CONFINED PHASE BEHAVIOR", "Abstrak": "Shale oil flow is commonly affected by the confined phase behavior, complex fracture geometries, and geomechanical\neffect, which are not fully considered in the conventional compositional simulators. In this study, a\ncoupled compositional flow and geomechanics model is presented to incorporate these effects for more accurate\nprediction on shale oil production performance. The compositional model considering the confined phase\nbehavior is used to model the multiphase flow in shale formations, in which the capillary pressure is introduced\ninto the workflows of phase stability test and flash calculation. The embedded discrete fracture model (EDFM) is\nadopted to explicitly describe the complex fracture geometries. The deformations of hydraulic fractures and\nnatural fractures are handled by different constitutive models. A mixed finite-volume and finite-element (FVMFEM)\nscheme is used to discretize the flow and geomechanics equations, and the coupled problem is iteratively\nsolved by the fixed-stress splitting method. Based on the proposed model, simulations are conducted on a multistage\nfractured shale reservoir to evaluate the effects of confined phase behavior, hydraulic fracture deformation,\nand natural fracture network on the production performance. Results show that the bubble point pressure is\nsuppressed by the confined phase behavior effect, which leads to higher oil production. The hydraulic fracture\ndeformation takes effect only when the hydraulic fractures cannot be treated as infinite-conductivity under\npoorly-propped condition. The oil production is greatly promoted with the increase of natural fracture density\ndue to the increase of interface area between matrix and fractures.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yuhu Bai [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Lijun Liu", "Weipeng Fan", "Hai Sun", "Zhaoqin Huang", "Jun Yao"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Shale oil; Compositional model; Coupled flow and geomechanics; Confined phase behavior; EDFM", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 196,\u00a0January 2021, 107608", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Jan 2022"}
