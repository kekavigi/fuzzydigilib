One of the methods to eliminate pathogens while preserving the nutrition and flavor in food is the ultrasonication technique. Our lab has developed a multi-frequency ultrasonicator and studied the breakdown behavior of bacteria using a simulation study. However, the simulation study still lacks the primary data source, thus reliant on secondary data. This research focuses on introducing a device that can measure and act as a primary data source to complement the simulation study.\nAtomic Force Microscope (AFM) is commonly used to measure cell mechanical properties. In this work, we assembled an improvised AFM setup to measure the mechanical properties of biofilm based on Rico et al. contact mechanics model. Kombucha tea extract biofilm was chosen as the specimen as it is one of the most extensive bacterial samples studied found in the literature.\nExperiment results that the setup, although not accurate, is capable of producing results near to one to two order of magnitudes for the hypothetical case 3. The AFM setup has been assembled and has proven its overall functionality as a proof of concept, which will act as the first breakthrough research in our lab and inspire others to improve the device.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Kevin": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/259619"}, "Penulis": "Kevin [13118203]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
