{"Nomor": 61020, "Judul": "BULK FLOW IN THE LOCAL UNIVERSE FROM 6DFGS, SDSS, AND LAMOST PECULIAR VELOCITIES", "Abstrak": "Peculiar velocity analysis is currently a growing field due to the advent of new\ndata from various surveys. One statistic that can be derived from peculiar\nvelocity analyses is the bulk flow within the survey volume, which is closely\nrelated to the cosmological model and so can be used to test theories. To measure\nthe bulk flow accurately, a sky coverage as complete as possible is needed\nto disentangle the dipole from the monopole component of the velocity field. In\nthis work, we use the Fundamental Plane (FP) relation for early-type galaxies\nto measure distances by combining the velocity dispersion measurements from\nthe 6dFGS, SDSS, and LAMOST spectroscopic surveys. Our sample has a sky\ncoverage of ?3.0? steradians out to redshift z ? 0.055. We use near-infrared\nJ-band photometry from the 2MASS Extended Source Catalog to make our\nsample as homogeneous as possible. We fit the FP with a 3D Gaussian using\na maximum likelihood method. We measure peculiar velocities as the logarithmic\nratio of the distances inferred from observed redshifts and comoving\ndistances derived from the FP. Our final peculiar velocity sample consists of\n15525 individual galaxies. We measure the bulk flow within the survey volume\ndirectly from the log-distance ratio measurements using a maximum likelihood\nmethod. We find bulk flow amplitudes of 236 \u00b1 62, 248 \u00b1 50, 296 \u00b1 41, and\n262 \u00b1 41 km s?1 at scales 46, 56, 68, and 77 h?1 Mpc, respectively. These\namplitudes are consistent at 1? with the root-mean-square bulk motions expected\nin a standard ?CDM cosmology. The direction of the bulk flow we\nmeasure is consistent with both previous measurements and the direction of\nthe cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole motion.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Muhammad Rafif Rabbani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/235730", "COVER Muhammad Rafif Rabbani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/236003", "BAB 1 Muhammad Rafif Rabbani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/236004", "BAB 2 Muhammad Rafif Rabbani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/236011", "BAB 3 Muhammad Rafif Rabbani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/236013", "BAB 4 Muhammad Rafif Rabbani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/236014", "BAB 5 Muhammad Rafif Rabbani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/236018", "BAB 6 Muhammad Rafif Rabbani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/236019", "PUSTAKA Muhammad Rafif Rabbani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/236020"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Rafif Rabbani [20320002]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dra.
