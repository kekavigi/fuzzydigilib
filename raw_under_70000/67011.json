{"Nomor": 67011, "Judul": "ESTIMATION OF FLUID-ROCK INTERACTION PROCESS AND RECHARGE AREA OF THE TAMPOMAS GEOTHERMAL FIELD, WEST JAVA, INDONESIA BY WATER CHEMISTRY", "Abstrak": "Geochemistry is one of the most effective methods used in the geothermal exploration process, especially related to subsurface temperature, interaction process, and geothermal fluid source. This preliminary research is aimed to clarify the origin of geothermal fluid and process of rock and fluid interaction that occurred in the Tampomas geothermal field in the northern Bandung Basin, one of\nthe geothermal potential fields in this basin. The potential in the northern Bandung basin is estimated to be lower than the southern basin in which several fields such as Kamojang, Darajat, and Wayang Windu produce considerable geothermal energy, ranging from 200 to 300 MWe. To reveal this potential difference is an important issue for the geothermal system in the plate subduction zone. The\ngeochemical analysis was applied to it. Generally, water type of hot spring in the Tampomas area is dominated by chloride-bicarbonate water, where water is formed in the marginal area near the surface. CO2 gas and water vapor are condensed into cold groundwater as well as steam heated processes. The low B / Cl ratio in the hot springs indicates a close relationship with the magmatic geothermal\nsystem. The Ciuyah hot spring has the highest concentrations of chloride, calcium, and lithium among the other manifestations, which is probably due to fluid interaction with the Tertiary marine sedimentary rocks in this area, in particular the Tertiary claystone of the Subang Formation. The maximum subsurface temperature in the Tampomas area is 168 ?C based on a silica geothermometer. Study on stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen suggest that the recharge area in the Tampomas geothermal manifestation is located in the elevation range from 425 to 900 m.a.s.l. Consequently, through our geochemical data, the geothermal fluids originating from meteoric water have been influenced by the volcanic process of Mt.Tampomas and interacting with the sedimentary rocks around it.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Yudi Rahayudin": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/253974", "2018 YUDI RAHAYUDIN 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/253975", "2018 YUDI RAHAYUDIN 1-PAPER.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/253976", "2018 YUDI RAHAYUDIN 1-PAPER.pdf\niu": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/253977"}, "Penulis": "Yudi Rahayudin [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Koki Kashiwaya, Andi Susmanto, Yohei Tada, Irwan Iskandar, Katsuaki Koike"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Tampomas, Bandung, Water chemistry, Fluid-rock Interaction", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Jul 2022"}
