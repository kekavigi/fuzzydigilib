{"Nomor": 63250, "Judul": "CONTRIBUTION TO THE AGEING CONTROL OF ONSHORE OIL AND GAS FIELDS", "Abstrak": "The ageing of the Algerian oil and gas (O&G) installations has led to many incidents. Such installations are over 30 years old (life cycle) and still in operation. To deal with this O&G crucial problem, the Algerian authorities have launched a rehabilitation and modernization schedule of these installations. Within the framework of this program, many audit operations are initiated to elaborate a general diagnosis of the works to be performed while optimizing production. In other words, industrial ageing risks shall be controlled. In the process safety management (PSM) context, the aim of this paper is to study ageing problem of the Algerian industrial installations through proposed indicators. Their prioritization adjusted by (TOPSIS) Technique for Order-Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution method which allows identification of ageing control solutions of Algerian onshore fields.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Belmazouzi Yacine [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Djebabra M\u00e9barek", "Hadef Hefaidh"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Onshore; Oil and gas; Field; Ageing; Control; Indicators; Prioritization", "Sumber": "Petroleum, Volume 6, Issue 3, 2020, Pages 311-317, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S240565611930063X", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Jan 2022"}
