LiHo.sp,wo crivo Cy tract was prepared by submerging the fresh Tinospora crispa stem that has been made into smaller particles in distillated water at 60 't for 6 hours. The effect towards the immune system was tested on Swiss Webster mice. Two dose of the Tinospora crispa was tested. that is 32.5 and 65 mg/kg body weight of mice. Selenium was used as the standard. The immunological parameter that is determined is the antibody titer, interferon-y and TNF-a. The\n\\ uI the e..\\tract to scavenge the free radicals was determined using the DPPH test. Both dose of the extract that is high dose (65mg/Kg), and low dose (32.5mg/Kg) were capable of stimulating the formation of primary and secondary antibody titer. Selenium that was used as the standard also increases the antibody titer \u2014 both primary and secondary. However, for two doses of the extract and the selenium did not stimulate the production of IFN-y. Towards the TNF-a, only the high dose of the extract Thmspora cri.spa was able to increase the production of TNF-a very significantly (p<0.01). Lastly, as for the DPPH test, the extract showed the highest number of percentage of inhibition 81.88\u00b11.56 as compared to ascorbic acid and selenium. Tinospora crisp(' extract has the potential to be developed as an anti-cancer agent with a mechanism by modul.,aion immune system.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Low Ee How": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/247218"}, "Penulis": "Low Ee How [10710772]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Maria Immaculata Iwo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sains dan Teknologi Farmasi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Farmasi", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Mei 2022"}
