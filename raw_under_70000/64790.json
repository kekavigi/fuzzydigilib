{"Nomor": 64790, "Judul": "DETERMINING THE INDENTITY COMPOUND OF ECLIPTA ALBA (L.) HASSK. HERB", "Abstrak": "Eclipta alba, a tropical herb, has been used traditionally for promoting hair growth, and as a powerful liver tonic. However, there is no pronoun marker compound commercially available. The aim of this research was to determine the identity compound of Eclipta alba herb. The phytochemical screening was carried out and it was found that flavonoid and steroid/triterpcnoid are present. The crude drug was extracted by reflux using three different solvents which were ethanol, ethyl acetate and n-hexane giving the yields of 1.05%, 1.82 %, and 8.56%. respectively. All of the extracts were monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using silica gel GF254 as the stationery phase and the mobile phases were n-hexane \u2014 ethyl acetate (7:3) for n-hexane extract, n-hexane \u2014 ethyl acetate (4:6) for ethyl acetate extract and chloroform \u2014 acetone \u2014 acetic acid (5:5:1) for ethanol extract. Sulphuric acid 10% in methanol was used as spraying reagent for extract monitoring. Ethanol extract was selected for isolation by preparative thin layer chromatography (pTLC). One isolate was obtained and purity test was carried out on the isolate showed single spot on both 3 different development systems of TLC and two \u2014 dimensional TLC. The single spot on TLC was sprayed with citroboric spraying reagent giving a blue, fluorescence under UV 366 nm. The isolate was identified and characterized by ultraviolet- visible spectrophotometer using several spectral shifting reagents and by two-dimensional paper chromatography. The UV-visible spectrum has two peaks on wavelength of 249 nm and 350 nm. The isolate was developed on two \u2014 dimensional paper chromatography showed the position of an aglycone flavone or flavonol. The isolate which was a flavonol with 3, 3' and 4' hydroxyl group was proposed to be the identity compound for Eclipta alba herb.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Shalini A P Vythilingam": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/248116"}, "Penulis": "Shalini A P Vythilingam [10709717]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dra.
