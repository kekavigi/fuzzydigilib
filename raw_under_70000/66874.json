{"Nomor": 66874, "Judul": "AERODYNAMIC SHAPE OPTIMIZATION OF HORIZONTAL AXIS WIND TURBINE BLADE IN SIDRAP WIND FARM USING GENETIC ALGORITHM", "Abstrak": "Indonesia is still lagging in adopting wind energy as the primary renewable source. Even\nthough, Indonesia had built its first wind farm at Sidrap region. It uses 30 Gamesa G114-2.5 MW\nturbine. The turbine has ???????? values less than 0.5. Unfortunately, it appears that average windspeed\nat Sidrap is not very well suited for the turbine. Hence, there is a space for improvement by\nincreasing efficiency and having less costly turbine.\nThe focus of this study is to produce wind turbine blade design with maximized Annual\nEnergy Production (AEP) and minimized blade skin area. To achieve that, a single point multilevel\noptimization scheme is used. The optimization results new airfoil profile, chord\ndistribution, and twist angle distribution. Fluid flow solver program named XFOIL is used in\nthis study to aid the optimization program. The optimization succeeded in increasing AEP by\n536 MWH or a 7.6% increase with lower blade skin area.\nWith the increasing world energy demand, space for further optimization is open,\nespecially for utility scale wind turbine. The optimization presented in this study can be further\nimproved to yield better result.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Mirza Artha Vardia": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/253445"}, "Penulis": "Mirza Artha Vardia [13118003]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
