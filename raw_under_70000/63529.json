{"Nomor": 63529, "Judul": "EFFECTS OF SURFACTANT MOLECULAR STRUCTURE ON THE STABILITY OF WATER IN OIL EMULSION", "Abstrak": "The stability of a water-in-oil emulsion is the key to the water control technology for active crude oil, and different surfactants have direct influence on the emulsion properties. Thus, it is necessary to investigate the relationship between the molecular structure of surfactants and the stability of the crude oil emulsion. This study used emulsification experiments to investigate emulsion stability. In particular, the effects of the number of saturated alkyl carbon atoms on the lipophilic end, saturation of the alkyl chains and the number of hydrophobic branched-chains on the emulsion were analyzed with a viscometer, microscope and tensiometer. The results showed that longer hydrophobic monoalkyl chains produced more effective emulsifiers; however, unsaturated bonds on the hydrophobic alkyl chain or highly branched alkyl chains reduced the emulsifying effect.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Guangsheng Cao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Tong Du", "Yujie Bai", "Tingyuan Yang", "Jize Zuo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Water-in-oil emulsifier; Surfactant; Molecular structure; Interfacial film; Hydrophobic group", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 196, 2021, 107695, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920410520307609", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "16 Feb 2022"}
