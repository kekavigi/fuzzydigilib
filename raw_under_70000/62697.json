{"Nomor": 62697, "Judul": "A MINIMUM VOLUME PREDICTION OF SPACER BASED ON TURBULENT DISPERSION THEORY: MODEL AND EXAMPLE", "Abstrak": "During cementing operations involving cement slurry contamination, problems often occur due to the inaccurate\ncalculation of the space fluid volume. This study, based on the turbulent dispersion theory, developed a\nminimum volume calculation model of spacer fluid to prevent cement slurry contamination. This model was\nused to analyze influence factors and practical calculations. The results indicated that the minimum volume of\nspacer fluid increase with the eccentricity of casing and injection rate and decrease with the density of cement\nslurry. Additionally, the better rheological properties of the cement slurry and spacer fluid would increase the\nvolume of the spacer fluid. Furthermore, this model fitted actual field data better than other heat calculation\nmodels.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "DEYANG XU [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jianchun Guo", "Bin Yuan", "Dayang Wen", "Xiang Fang", "Hailiang Li", "Bo Ling"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Cementing, Spacer fluid, Mixing volume, Dispersion coefficient", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 5, Issue 4, Pages 397-401 (December 2019), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2019.09.002", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Jan 2022"}
