{"Nomor": 64365, "Judul": "OPTIMASI METODE ISOLASI PLANTARISIN TAHAP PRESIPITASI GARAM DART LACTOBACILLUS PLANTARUM DP-42", "Abstrak": "Plantaricin is a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum and has bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity. Plantaricin commonly was isolated by salt precipitation, dialysis, and column chromatography. In this research, the aim of this study was to isolate plantaricin purification by use the most common salt which is ammonium sulphate and sodium sulphate in salt precipitation step. Plantaricin was extracted from cell-free supernatant from L. plantarum DP-42 culture. Plantaricin was precipitated by ammonium sulphate 60% (% w/v) then homogenized at 4\u00b0C. Meanwhile for sodium sulphate precipitation, sodium sulphate 40% (')/0 w/v) was used then homogenized at 25\u00b0C. The next purification step was dialysis in potassium phosphate buffer pH 6,8 and cation exchange column chromatography by CMC (carboxy methyl cellulose) in potassium phosphate buffer 0,1 M pH 7 and NaCI 0,15 M as an eluen. Fractions of column chromatography was analyzed by absorbance by spectrophotometer UV-vis at = 280 nm. Based on this research, the precipitate and protein concentration from sodium sulphate was higher than ammonium sulphate in concentration of 40% (% w/v). Protein concentration of ammonium sulphate precipitation was 0,693+0,004 g/dL, whereas of sodium sulphate was 4,59+0,018 g/dL. The result showed that sodium sulphate produced plantaricin concentration higher than ammonium sulphate precipitation in concentration of 40%.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Aniendha Dyas Ramadhani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246448"}, "Penulis": "Aniendha Dyas Ramadhani [10709033]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Marlia Singgih, Ph.D.", "Dr. rer. nat.
