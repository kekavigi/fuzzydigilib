{"Nomor": 63656, "Judul": "QUANTITATIVE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE BLOCKAGE EFFECT FROM DISPERSED PHASE ON WAX MOLECULAR DIFFUSION IN WATER-IN-OIL EMULSION", "Abstrak": "Molecular diffusion is the main mechanism of wax deposition, whereas the dispersed water droplets influence the wax diffusivity in water-in-oil (w/o) emulsion by restricting the diffusion path. In the present work, geometric analysis method was used to analyze the blockage effect from dispersed phase on the restricted diffusion path of wax molecules in w/o emulsion, and a correlation was proposed relating the blockage effect with water fraction, dispersed degree and nonuniformity of dispersed phase in real emulsions. Firstly, regarding water droplets as spherical particles with uniform size and arrangement pattern, the average tortuosity of different wax diffusion paths was deduced in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) ideal conditions. The results showed that the blockage degree was enhanced with the increase in water fraction. Moreover, the droplet size distribution of different w/o emulsions was investigated by microscopic observation and a set of microstructure characterization parameters were summarized in statistics. A 3D microstructure model of real emulsion was established to derive the tortuosity, taking the effect of droplet size distribution into consideration. The blockage effect was enhanced by the increase in the dispersity and polydispersity of water droplets, but this influence was not significant and water fraction was still the main influencing factor. On this basis, a correlation of blockage coefficient with water fraction, number-averaged diameter and polydispersity was proposed and validated using the 1H/19F-NMR test results in literature with the average relative error being 3.17%. This will provide a support to the revealing of wax diffusion mechanism in w/o emulsions and the wax deposition prediction of multiphase flow pipelines.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Si Li [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Kaifeng Fan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Water-in-oil emulsion; Wax diffusion; Blockage effect; Tortuosity; Water fraction; Droplet size distribution", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 196, 2021, 108012, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920410520310676", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Feb 2022"}
