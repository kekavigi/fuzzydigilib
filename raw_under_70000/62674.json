{"Nomor": 62674, "Judul": "MAJOR ELEMENTS DISTRIBUTION IN THE KILIRAN AND TALAWI OIL SHALES", "Abstrak": "Sixteen samples of Late Eocene Kiliran and Talawi oil shales from Brown Shale Formation (Kiliran Basin) and Sangkarewang Formation (Ombilin Basin), respectively, Indonesia were collected from two drill cores. Total organic carbon (TOC) and x-ray flourescence (XRF) analysis have been carried out to investigate the correlation between major elements and organic matter contents in the oil shales. Kiliran and Ombilin oil shales have potential to generate shale oil as indicated by TOC of about 12.21% and 4.99%, respectively. TOC values increase with drilling depth increment in both oil shales. This indicates that deposition occurred in the deep depositional environment in early deposition, with Ca and S elements as indicators. Both elements considered as autochtonous input indicators because of their similiarity in tendency with TOC toward drilling depth. On the other hand, Si, Ti, Al and K elements are terrigeneous input indicators that tend to have less concentration with drilling depth increment. This indicates basin shoaling during the oil shales depositions.", "Daftar File": {"2012 ISRA KHOIRI 1-INVITATION.pdf?_": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/241331", "2012 ISRA KHOIRI 1-POSTER.pdf5?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/241335", "2012 ISRA KHOIRI 1-PAPER.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/241336"}, "Penulis": "Isra Khoiri [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Agus Haris Widayat,Syafrizal, Komang Anggayana, M Nur Heriawan, Arie Naftali Hawu Hede, Andy Yahya Al Hakim"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "oil shale, major elements, depositional environments, Kiliran, Sangkarewang", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani \u00a0\n                                     Resti Andriani", "File": "3 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Jan 2022"}
