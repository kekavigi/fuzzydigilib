The\nderivation is based on the analysis proposed by Dong et al. [Journal of Colloid and Interface Science 172 (1995)\n21\u201336]. This analytical solution allows the critical oil film thickness in three-phase systems to be calculated\nconveniently without lengthy calculation and be readily applied in simulation of three-phase systems in porous\nmedia using predictive models. The equation was examined by comparing the analytical solutions with the\nnumerical results by Dong et al. Using the analytical solution, the reason why the oil phase spreads between the\ngas and water phases in three-phase systems in porous media was analyzed. The spreading of oil phase is\ncontrolled by the free energy change, and the spreading of oil phase only occurs in the system when the free\nenergy change during the oil spreading process is negative. Also, there is a critical oil film thickness controlling\nthis process that is a function of interfacial tension, contact angles, and corner angles. This analytical solution of\ncritical oil film thickness can also be utilized to find the correlation of three-phase capillary pressure when the\nsystem is in thermodynamic equilibrium for water-wet porous media. This correlation should be useful in porescale\nsimulation of three-phase flow of spreading oil.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yajun Li [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Peng Jia Mingzhe Dong"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Three-phase flow, Oil film, Critical oil film thickness, Imbibition, Capillary pressure, Analytical solution", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 208, Part A,\u00a0January 2022, 109263", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Jan 2022"}
