The quantitative characterization of bound and movable fluid microdistribution is important for reservoir evaluation, productivity prediction, and petroleum recovery. However, due to the complexity of the fluid microdistribution in porous rocks, there is currently no effective method to achieve the continuous and quantitative characterization of the downhole or subsurface bound and movable fluid microdistribution. In this study, a method is proposed for the continuous and quantitative characterization of bound and movable fluid microdistribution in porous rocks based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. First, 19 conventional sandstone samples collected from the Songliao Basin and 19 tight sandstone samples from the Ordos basin in China were evaluated using NMR experiments under fully water-saturated and bound water conditions and the transverse relaxation time (T2) distributions of the saturated, bound, and movable water were obtained. Based on the findings from the NMR experiments, two exponential functions were proposed to quantitatively characterize the proportional coefficient distribution of the bound and movable fluids in pores of different sizes and to obtain the corresponding T2 distributions of the bound and movable fluids. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by comparing the prediction results with the experimental results. Finally, the proposed method was extended into field applications in a tight sandstone reservoir in the Ordos Basin, China. The results of this study provide practical guidance for the exploration and development of oil and gas resources.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Guowen Jin [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ranhong Xie", "Lizhi Xiao", "Bohan Wu", "Chenyu Xu", "Xiaoyu Wang", "Tangyu Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Nuclear magnetic resonance; Porous rocks; Fluid microdistribution; Proportional coefficient distribution", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 196, 2021, 107677, ISSN 0920-4105,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920410520307440", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Jan 2022"}
