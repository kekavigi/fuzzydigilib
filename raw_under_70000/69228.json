{"Nomor": 69228, "Judul": "LITERATURE REVIEW ON EFFECT OF ANABOLIC STEROIDS ABUSE ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND MENTAL HEALTH", "Abstrak": "Anabolic-androgenic steroids, also known as anabolic steroids (abbreviated as AAS), are a kind of\nsynthetic androgen that have similar function to testosterone. AAS was developed and successfully\nisolated during 1935 and it began to be widely used between athletes during that time. AAS gave\nthe athletes better performance which was unfair to non-using athletes. After that, the\nInternational Olympic Committee decided to list AAS as one of the banned substances in sports. As\nthat time, AAS was not being studied extensively for its long-term side effects. This review mainly\nfocused on the long-term side effects of AAS users and abusers. The inclusion criteria for this study\nwere participants that use different AAS drugs and participants had no other mental diseases before\ntaking AAS. Database searches were conducted using PubMed, and Science Direct databases. The\narticles included for the review were those published between 2000 and 2022, for studying the\nlong-term effects. The review indicates that long-term AAS usage might be associated with eating\ndisorder, premature mortality, aggressiveness, antisocial trait, brain aging, poor neurovascular\ncontrol under mental stress, and poor sleeping patterns.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Melvin Liew Jia Hao": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/260181"}, "Penulis": "Melvin Liew Jia Hao [11618104]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Kusnandar Anggadiredja, S.Si., M.Si."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Farmasi Klinik dan Komunitas", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Farmasi", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Anabolic steroids, AAS, anabolic\u2013androgenic steroids, mental health, central nervous system, nervous system, side effects", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Sep 2022"}
