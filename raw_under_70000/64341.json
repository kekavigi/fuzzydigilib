{"Nomor": 64341, "Judul": "ISOTHERMIC ADSORPTION OF PIROXICAM POLYMORPHS WITH INFLUENCE OF MECHANICAL STRESS", "Abstrak": "A drug may undergo polymorphic transformation when mechanical stress like milling is applied or when exposed to a humid environment. This research was done to study the effect of milling and isotherm adsorption on piroxicam polymorphs, Form I and II. The piroxicam Form I was obtained commercially while polymorph Form II was prepared using solvent evaporation method. One half of the both polymorphs were subjected to milling for 2 hours. The samples were then exposed to RH 75 and 84% simultaneously in two different desiccators. The adsorption study lasted for 30 days. Characterization of the samples included the usage of Powder X-Ray Diffraction (PXRD), Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) and polarizing microscope. The moisture content was determined using Karl Fischer titrimetry method. The results showed that milling for 2 hours did not cause any polymorphic transformation but it decreased the crystallinity of the crystals. The isotherm adsorption curves for the both polymorphs were sigmoidal, type II. The adsorption rate of Form I, I milled and II in both RH were not significantly different, however the adsorption rate of Form H milled was very high. There were no any polymorphic transformations observed due to the moisture adsorption. Form I and II were stable under the influence of stress, in this case milling for 2 hotirs and it did not undergo polymorphic transformation when exposed to a humid environment, in this case RH 75 and 84%.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Jasmine Kaur Sidhu": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246424"}, "Penulis": "Jasmine Kaur Sidhu [10709707]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Sundani Nurono"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sains dan Teknologi Farmasi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Farmasi", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Piroxicam, polymorphs, milling, relative humidity (R}I), isotherm adsorption", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Mei 2022"}
