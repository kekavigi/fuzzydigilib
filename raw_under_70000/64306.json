{"Nomor": 64306, "Judul": "A DYNAMIC SIMULATION OF ROTATIVE GAS LIFT FOR DEWATERING COAL BED METHANE WELLS", "Abstrak": "Coal Bed Methane production is quite different from conventional reservoir. Initially most coal reservoirs are water saturated, therefore in order to produce methane gas form the reservoirs, water has to be removed. The phenomena by which gas is produced during and after water production is called dewatering process. A proper dewatering method is a key to achieve significant gas production. This study presents the Rotative Gas Lift (RGL) as an alternative method for dewatering coal bed methane wells. A dynamic transient and integrated simulation was conducted in order to determine optimal operational practices for RGL dewatering design, including required gas injection rate and injection time, and stability of gas production which produce earlier gas rate peaks and maximum cumulative production.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Gany Gunawan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246333"}, "Penulis": "Gany Gunawan [12208032]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof.Dr. Ir.
