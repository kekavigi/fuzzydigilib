{"Nomor": 66270, "Judul": "KNOWLEDGE & BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS OF GASTRITIS SELF-MEDICATION AMONG UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS BATCH 2018 IN INSTITUT TEKNOLOGI BANDUNG", "Abstrak": "Prevalence of gastritis in Indonesia is high particularly among university students. Although gastritis\ncan be managed with self-medication, it is often performed incorrectly. This study was designed to\ninvestigate the knowledge and behavior of gastritis self-medication among undergraduate\nstudents batch 2018 in Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB), who are currently in the final year of their\nstudy. This research was conducted using a self-developed questionnaire. The questionnaire was\nvalidated and then sent to undergraduate students batch 2018 in ITB who had experienced\ngastritis symptoms and willing to fill in the questionnaire. The total respondent was 271. Overall,\nknowledge level of undergraduate students \u00ad\u00a0?\u00ae\u00ed ????\u00f0??????????\u00a0??\u00e3??\u00b8??\u00f0?\u00ed ???respondents,\n?\u00b1???\u00e3\u00ed??\u00f0?\u00ed ????\u00b1????\u00b8\u00b1????\u00a0?\u00b8 ?\u00ad\u00a0\u00b8??\u00f0?\u00ed ??respondents. Knowledge question regarding\nNSAID as one of the risk factors of gastritis had a relatively high number of wrong answers\ncompared to others. The answers for questions regarding behavior were dominated by strongly\nagree (80%), indicating good behavior in gastritis self-medication. Gender and the faculty of the\nstudents (pharmacy vs. non-pharmacy) may influence the level of knowledge. Whereas for\nbehavior, there was no influence of sociodemographic background. In conclusion, knowledge and\nbehavior of undergraduate students, batch 2018 in ITB regarding gastritis self- medication were\ngood. However, the knowledge and behavior can be improved for certain issues such as risk of\ngastritis due to NSAID use and performed education targeted to male students who had relatively\nlower knowledge compared to women.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Gloria Gracia": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250829"}, "Penulis": "Gloria Gracia [11618105]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["apt.
