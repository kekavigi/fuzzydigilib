Many of these NPs may\nhave toxic effects on human body cells as zinc oxide and Silver NPs, which showed\na toxic effect on the male reproductive system. Phyllanthus niruri (PN) is a\nworldwide distributed tropical plant that has multiple pharmacological activities\nsuch as anti-malarial and immunomodulator. Previous research obtained\nsignificant efficacy by encapsulating PN extract and HBsAg by chitosan NP as co\nadjuvant to enhance the immune response to hepatitis vaccine. Many studies\nshowed that PN has a toxic effect on the male reproductive system, especially on\nthe Sertoli cell of testis and sperm parameters, and that affects male fertility. There\nare no studies related to the toxicity of chitosan NP loaded with PN extract on male\nfertility. The current study was designed to evaluate the toxic effects of chitosan NP\nloaded with PN extract on sperm characteristics of adult Swiss Webster male mice.\nThis study focused on the preparation and characterization of chitosan NPs loaded\nwith PN extract and in vivo study the nanotoxicological effect on sperm quality. 24\nSwiss Webster male mice were divided randomly into six groups of 4 mice and\nadministered treatment intraperitoneally (IP) once daily for 14 days. Group I\n(control) did not receive treatment, group II received blank nanoparticles\n100mg/kg body weight (BW), groups III and IV received PN Extract 25mg/kg BW\nand 100mg/kg BW respectively, and groups V and VI received PN NP 25mg/kg BW\nand 100mg/kg BW respectively. The animals were sacrificed, and epididymal\nsperms were collected and analyzed for sperm count, motility, and morphology.\nThe findings showed that the prepared NPs have a good characteristic as NP size\naround 178 nm, Polydispersity index (PI) 0.23, Zeta potential +37 mv, and good\nentrapment efficiency (EE%) 74%. Significant reduction (p < 0.05) in epididymal\nsperm count and motility in treated groups IV, V, and VI were observed, and\nsignificant (p < 0.05) increased in abnormal sperm morphology characterized by\nno head, no hook, and bent tail were also observed in these treated groups\ncompared to control while no significant (p < 0.05) alteration in sperm quality in\ngroups II and III. Blank chitosan NPs even in high dose, did not show any toxicity \non sperm parameters, proving that chitosan NPs are safe on the male reproductive\nsystem. In contrast, A high dose of PN extract showed a toxic effect on sperm quality\nand when loading PN extract in chitosan NPs, even in low dose showed toxicity by\naltering male fertility parameters, thus altering the reproductive functioning of the\nsperm cells conferring antifertility properties on the mice.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Wurood Abdulabbas Naji": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/241547"}, "Penulis": "Wurood Abdulabbas Naji [20719701]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. apt.
