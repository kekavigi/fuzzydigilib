{"Nomor": 63221, "Judul": "GIS MODELING USING FUZZY LOGIC APPROACH IN MINERAL PROSPECTING BASED ON GEOPHYSICAL DATA", "Abstrak": "The geophysical exploration method is the superior over the project area due to the dense of vegetation and thick soil so very limited geological outcrops. Contrast of physical properties of every different rock type should be able to be distinguished by the geophysical data. Fuzzy logic approach and weight of evidence were used for geophysical data modeling. Posterior probability was used to calculate the weight of evidence (WofE) of every fuzzy map memberships. By combining each rock type model, the model provides better result compared from the model from mixed rock type on the data training. This method is able to eliminate the potential interference of different geophysical signature. So that, the understanding the geological feature of the area is key success for the mineral prosperity modeling. We verified the model by site visiting and drilling and it is estimated about 90% confident.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Harman Setyadi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242348", "2015 HARMAN SETYADI 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242350", "2015 HARMAN SETYADI 1-PAPER.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242352", "2015 HARMAN SETYADI 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242357"}, "Penulis": "Harman Setyadi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Lilik Eko Widodo, Sudarto Notosiswoyo, Putri Saptawati, Arief Ismanto, Iip Hardjana"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "GIS Modeling, fuzzy logic approach, weight of evidence (WofE)", "Sumber": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.4941643", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani \u00a0\n                                     Alice Diniarti", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Jan 2022"}
