{"Nomor": 64631, "Judul": "ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EFFECT OF ANANAS COMOSUS L. MERR FRESH JUICE", "Abstrak": "Protease enzyme known as bromelain in the pineapple fruits (Ananas conwsus.(L)Merr) tends to give the anti-inflammatory effect. Bromelain in young pineapple is known to be higher compared to ripe pineapples. The aim of this study is to test the anti-inflammatory effect of the young and the ripe pineapple's fresh juice on carrageenan induced paw oedema of Wistar male rats. The fresh juice was prepared in the concentration of 250g/100m1. Rats were divided into six groups with six rats per group consisting of positive control group, reference group (diclofenac sodium 25mg) and groups of young pineapple juice 1m1/200g, young pineapple juice 2m1/200g, ripe pineapple juice 1m1/200g and ripe pineapple juice 2m1/200g respectively. Paw oedema were measured one hour after carrageenan administration until the fifth hour using plethysmometer. Amount of bromelain in the young and ripe pineapple juice were measured using protease activity assay using casein as a substrate. Rats in diclofenac group showed the smallest percentage of oedema at second hour as 27.33%. Young pineapple juice with the dose of 1m1/200g showed oedema percentage as 67.15% at second hour while young pineapple juice with the dose of 2m1/200g showed significance at the second hour and also third hour with oedema percentage of 72.81% and 116.36%. Ripe pineapple juice at all doses did not differ significantly with positive control. Bromelain assay showed that young pineapple juice contained more bromelain (0.5568 units/ml) compared to ripe (0.5262 units/ml). The fresh juice of young pineapple at the dose of 1m1/200g and 2m1/200g has an anti-inflammatory effect.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Sanggeri A P M Veloo": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/247221"}, "Penulis": "Sanggeri A P M Veloo [10710775]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Elin Yulinah", "Dr. Neng fisheri Kurniati"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sains dan Teknologi Farmasi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Farmasi", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Mei 2022"}
