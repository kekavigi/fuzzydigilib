{"Nomor": 62165, "Judul": "THE EFFECT OF ADDITIONAL EDUCATION AND DIETARY INTERVENTION ON PATIENTS WITH HYPERPHOSPHATEMIA", "Abstrak": "Background and Objective: Hyperphosphatemia is an electrolyte disturbance in which there is\nan abnormally elevated level of phosphate in the blood from the normal range of 2.5-4.5 mg/dL.\nHyperphosphatemia is a commonly present condition among chronic kidney disease patients.\nThis is normally due to the degradation of the kidney function among these patients. Chronic\nkidney disease (CKD) is the progressive loss of renal function over a period of time such as in\nmonths or years. Due to the tremendous reserve capacity of the kidneys, the abnormalities in\nrenal function are not detected until 75% functional capacity is lost. The additional education and\ndietary intervention helps the patients in treating hyperphosphatemia patients via non-\npharmacological method. This study was carried out to evaluate the success of dietary control in\nreducing phosphate level. Method and Study Design: The research is a descriptive design by\ncollected data retrospectively at Rumah Sakit Ginjal Ny. RA Habibie, from March 2013 until\nJuly 2013. Results: The total patient involved in this study was 24 chronic renal failure (CRF)\npatients where they were divided into two groups, group A (study group) and group B (control\ngroup), group A showed there is a significant difference between the mean and the P value of\n0.0001 while the group B showed no significant difference between the mean and the P value of\n0.1024, this shows the additional education and dietary intervention helped the patients in\nreducing their phosphate level. Conclusion: The reduction in phosphate level among\nhyperphosphatemia patients shows that hyperphosphatemia can be treated non-pharmacolo-\ngically as well educating the patients on their condition and ways to improve it", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Sri Vijay Akumahran": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/239659"}, "Penulis": "Sri Vijay Akumahran [10708712]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. apt.
