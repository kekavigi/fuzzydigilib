{"Nomor": 62867, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION OF POLYMETRIC SURFACTANT EMULSIFICATION AND VISCOSITY REDUCTION SYSTEM", "Abstrak": "Compounding polymer AP-P4 with high viscosity-reducing Gemini Surfactant HD, which is used as an emulsifier viscosity reduce, to improve the stability of the O/W emulsion while the viscosity reduction rate is kept. A polymeric surfactant emulsification and viscosity reduction system capable of forming a relatively stable O/W emulsion of heavy oil (0.5% HD+0.1% AP-P4) is then compounded. The system has been characterized as a high viscosity reduction rate and high stability. Meanwhile, the production liquid does not need to be added with a demulsifier and only needs to be heated to 70 \u00b0C to achieve effective demulsification. The influencing factors of the performance of the polymetric surfactant emulsification and viscosity reduction system were studied. When the oil-water ratio was 70:30 and 60:40, the viscosity reduction rate was 97.47% and 99.09%, respectively; after 15 h at 30 \u00b0C, the dehydration rates were 95.8% and 99.2%, respectively. The dehydration rate after 15 h at 70 \u00b0C was 98.1% and 99.4%, respectively; at 30 ? 50 \u00b0C, the water phase temperature has a greater impact on the viscosity; at 60 \u00b0C, 70 \u00b0C, the water phase temperature has little effect on the viscosity; as the temperature of the aqueous phase increased, the stability of the emulsion deteriorated. When the aqueous phase temperature was 30 \u00b0C, 50 \u00b0C and 70 \u00b0C, the dehydration rates of the emulsion after 15 h were 95.8%, 96.7% and 98.1%, respectively; As the degree of mineralization increases, the viscosity reduction rate decreases, and the stability of the emulsion deteriorates. The system has been used in field test for 2 injection wells, and the production rate of the two wells increased with a peak value of 25 m3/d and 20?t/d, respectively.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "DONGDONG WANG [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Nanjun Lai"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Heavy oil; Wellbore viscosity reduction; Emulsification; Polymer; Dehydration rate", "Sumber": "Petroleum, Volume 5, Issue 4, 2019, Pages 402-406, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S240565611830186X", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Jan 2022"}
