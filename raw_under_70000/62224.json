{"Nomor": 62224, "Judul": "SPATIAL ANALYSIS OF LANDSLIDE POTENTIAL ZONES USING GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM IN  KAMPUNGARENG AREA, LEMBANG, WEST BANDUNG", "Abstrak": "Landslide is one of the natural disasters that often cause casualties including lives, properties and land damages that impact long-term on people's lives. Identification of landslide potential zone is needed to reduce the losses. This research was conducted at KampungAreng and surrounding, Wangunsari Village, Lembang District, West Bandung Regency as the region was identified to have considerable landslide potential in some parts. The method used in this research is remote sensing integrated with Geographic Information System (GIS). Several parameters were used as a data set of landslide parameters, i.e., lineaments density, rivers density, slope angle, land cover, geological formation, and soil moistures. These data were utilized and processed using fuzzy logic operator in GIS software. \"MS Large\" type was selected to build fuzzy membership then the results were combined in Fuzzy Overlay with \"or\" type. Final classification of landslide areas was based on Fuzzy Overlay values. The result showed that Kampung Areng area can be divided into five classes of potential landslide areas. Areas with very high landslide potential covering 4% of the total area of study site, areas with high potential covering 36%, areas with medium potential covering 34%, areas with low potential covering 18%, and areas with very low potential covering 8%. The map of landslide potential zones can be used for the recommendation of development planning area at Kampung Areng and surrounding.", "Daftar File": {"cover.pdf??_": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/239742", "editorial board.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/239743", "daftar isi.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/239744", "paper.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/239745"}, "Penulis": "Mohamad Nur Heriawan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sobit Apriliana, Arie Naftali Hawu Hede"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "landslide, remote sensing, GIS, fuzzy membership, fuzzy overlay", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani \u00a0\n                                     Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Des 2021"}
