Therefore, artificial lift as a secondary method needs to be performed to maintain well production. Well-known for its reliability, Electrical Submersible Pump (ESP) is widely used across the world. Nowadays, numerous studies have discussed its operation. Despite its advantages, ESP is somehow limited to certain operating condition such as gassy wells, sand production, corrosive or well orientation. Failure in ESP might conduce losses, especially in the economic sector.\nTroubleshooting is an attempt to return the well into normal operation after some issues happen to the ESP. Unfortunately, there is no rigid guidance for its sequences, since each well has unique characteristics and requires different treatment. However, the pattern of symptoms could help an engineer to classify well issue tendency with a company of related references.\nIn this paper, studies were done in 3 wells which are X-51, X-62, and Y-34. Troubleshooting is conducted in X-62 and Y-34, while ESP design procedures are carried out in X-51 and X-62. Especially in X-62, the suitability of installed ESP with the design requirement is checked. Electrical Downhole Problem (EDHP) at X-62 and Sand Blockage at Y-34 are the main well issues and will be troubleshot. Prior to the diagnosis, monitoring ESP operating parameters is very crucial to generate a precise hypothesis. No flow status was found in both wells, resulting the ESP system to be down.\nResult of the design procedure exhibit a selected pump of D2400N for X-51 and D5800N for X-62. Installation of new ESP in both wells was also equipped with an intake separator with 80% efficiency, which aims to differ gas to the annulus.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Indira Caesalita Naranata": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250770"}, "Penulis": "Indira Caesalita Naranata [12218055]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Silvya Dewi Rahmawati, S.Si., M.Si., Ph.D.", "Wijoyo Niti Daton, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "ESP, Troubleshooting, ESP Design, EDHP, Sand blockage", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Jun 2022"}
