{"Nomor": 63427, "Judul": "FORMATION APPLICABILITY ANALYSIS OF STIMULATED RESERVOIR VOLUME FRACTURING AND CASE ANALYSIS", "Abstrak": "Stimulated Reservoir Volume (SRV) fracturing is a key technology of unconventional oil and gas exploration and development. To gain a deeper understanding of tight sandstone reservoirs and draw on the development experience of hydraulic fracturing, the authors conduct a large number of detailed investigations of geological characteristics in the regions that have implemented SRV fracturing. Based on the data of rock mechanics parameters, in-situ stress characteristics, brittleness characteristics and natural fractures, the influencing factors of SRV fracturing in tight oil reservoirs were analyzed. The results show that the SRV fracturing is suitable for geological reservoirs with the characteristics of medium to high elastic modulus, low to medium Poisson\u2019s ratio, low stress difference, medium to high brittleness and naturally fractured reservoirs, where natural fractures have a significant impact. Region A, a tight sandstone region, has moderate elastic modulus, low Poisson\u2019s ratio, low ground stress difference and medium brittleness, and has the feasibility of volume fracturing. The field case of the Y325 well shows that SRV fracturing technology has obvious effect on increasing production. This technology is applicable to the Region A.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Huan Zhao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wei Li", "Hui Pu", "Konghang Yang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Tight sandstone reservoir; Shale reservoir; Geological characteristics; SRV fracturing", "Sumber": "Petroleum, Volume 7, Issue 2, 2021, Pages 160-167, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405656120300626", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Feb 2022"}
