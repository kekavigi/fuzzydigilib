In the present work, a NiO/AlPO-5 nanocomposite using green TMG was synthesized as a particular adsorbent for asphaltenes removal. NiO/AlPO-5 was characterized using FTIR, BET, TEM, and XRD techniques. The Response Surface Method was used to optimize three important independent operating parameters, including D/C0 [(g)adsorbent/(mg/L)initial] (X1), initial pH (X2) and temperature (X3), to remove asphaltenes by the NiO/AlPO-5 nanocomposites in a model oil solution. Applying a CCD, a quadratic mathematical model formula was obtained to calculate asphaltene removal. The results revealed that the model showed valid agreement with the experimental results, with R2?=?0.94. The optimum values for D/C0, pH as well as temperature would be 0.08 [g/(mg/L)], 3.39 and 298?K, respectively. It was revealed that the optimal asphaltenes removal was 83.73% at the optimum point. The isothermal models of Langmuir and Freundlich represented the asphaltenes adsorption on the new adsorbent with acceptable accuracy.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Majid Mohammadi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mehdi Sedighi", "Meysam Hemati"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Asphaltene; Removal; Nanocomposite; Optimization; Adsorption", "Sumber": "Petroleum, Volume 6, Issue 2, 2020, Pages 182-188, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405656119300264", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Jan 2022"}
