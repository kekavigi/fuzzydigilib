{"Nomor": 63249, "Judul": "RESERVOIR ROCK PROPERTIES ESTIMATION BASED ON CONVENTIONAL AND NMR LOG DATA USING ANN-CUCKOO: A CASE STUDY IN ONE OF SUPER FIELDS IN IRAN SOUTHWEST", "Abstrak": "This work highlights the application of Artificial Neural Networks optimized by Cuckoo optimization algorithm for predictions of NMR log parameters including porosity and permeability by using field log data. The NMR logging data have some highly vital privileges over conventional ones. The measured porosity is independent from bearer pore fluid and is effective porosity not total. Moreover, the permeability achieved by exact measurement and calculation considering clay content and pore fluid type. Therefore availability of the NMR data brings a great leverage in understanding the reservoir properties and also perfectly modelling the reservoir. Therefore, achieving NMR logging data by a model fed by a far inferior and less costly conventional logging data is a great privilege. The input parameters of model were neutron porosity (NPHI), sonic transit time (DT), bulk density (RHOB) and electrical resistivity (RT). The outputs of model were also permeability and porosity values. The structure developed model was build and trained by using train data. Graphical and statistical validation of results showed that the developed model is effective in prediction of field NMR log data. Outcomes show great possibility of using conventional logging data be used in order to reach the precious NMR logging data without any unnecessary costly tests for a reservoir. Moreover, the considerable accuracy of newly ANN-Cuckoo method also demonstrated. This study can be an illuminator in areas of reservoir engineering and modelling studies were presence of accurate data must be essential.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ghasem Zargar [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Abbas Ayatizadeh Tanha", "Amirhossein Parizad", "Mehdi Amouri", "Hasan Bagheri"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Neural network; ANN-Cuckoo; NMR logging; Permeability modeling; Porosity modeling", "Sumber": "Petroleum, Volume 6, Issue 3, 2020, Pages 304-310, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405656119300598", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Jan 2022"}
