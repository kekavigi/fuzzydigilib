{"Nomor": 61367, "Judul": "BAMBOO SPECIES INVENTORY AND MAPPING AS RECOMMENDATION FOR PLANTATION MANAGEMENT IN BANDUNG AREA", "Abstrak": "Bamboo has become an important source of material for construction, traditional crafts, fabric,\nand the paper industry, as well as ecological roles for reducing the risk of erosion, absorbing\nextra water in the soil, and for storing carbon. To fully tap into Bamboo's potential, its data\nregarding species diversity and its culm condition must be well documented. INBAR Global\nSurvey is an android based app that can help researchers do their field survey to map out\nbamboo's diversity in a certain area. This research aims to document the bamboo species in\nBandung area alongside the plantation management system, and to test out the INBAR Global\nSurvey Application. This research was conducted in four locations, Hutan Penelitian\nArcamanik, Kebon Koleksi Awi Udjo, Ciharalang Road, and Ledeng area. The species name,\nnumber of clumps, clump's diameter, number of poles per age, poles diameter, health status,\nand management status were collected using the application. In total, there were 28 species\nfound coming from nine genera. Bambusa genera were found to have the highest species\ndiversity (11 species) followed by Gigantochloa (9 species). Bambusa vulgaris,\nDendrocalamus asper, and Gigantochloa apus were economically significant species found in\nfour sites. Kebon Koleksi Awi Udjo has the highest bamboo diversity (21 species), followed\nby Hutan Penelitian Arcamanik (13 species), Ledeng area (11 species), and lastly, Ciharalang\nroad (3 species). Based on the Sorensen similarity index, the composition of bamboo in Ledeng\narea and Kebon Koleksi Awi Udjo were the most similar (0.55). The highest number of clumps\nalongside the largest bamboo area were found in Hutan Penelitian Arcamanik (339 clumps,\n10376.62 m2). At all four locations, the majority of bamboo poles found are in 5-10 cm\ndiameter class. Hutan Penelitian Arcamanik has the highest unhealthy bamboo clumps\nproportion (57%), followed by Ledeng area (43%), Ciharalang road (33%), and Kebon Koleksi\nAwi Udjo (22%). In Hutan Penelitian Arcamanik the pole's age was quite evenly distributed\nthroughout the four age classes (1, 2, 3, and above 3 years old) with a lower number in the\nabove 3 years old class due to thinning. In Kebon Koleksi Awi Udjo, poles in age class oneyear-\nold were found to be the lowest in proportion (17%) indicating slow regeneration or\nimproper thinning. In Ciharalang and Ledeng area, most of the bamboo poles were found to be\nin age classes 2 and 3. This indicates slow regeneration and a lot of the bamboos could not\nsurvive due to poor health conditions. Those factors suggest that a lot of bamboos in Bandung\nare still not managed properly hence suffered from a lot of damage caused by disease, pest, or\nflooding/landslide. Regular maintenance such as thinning, trenching, mulching, and drainage\ncreation can help improve the bamboo conditions. Additionally, local community in Ciharalang\nrequire training regarding sustainable bamboo harvesting. Several shortcomings were found\nwhile using the application made INBAR Global Survey not particularly suitable to survey\ncollection plantation areas. On top of that, the application only facilitates clumping bamboo\nsurveys.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Aisyah Mustika": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/236214"}, "Penulis": "Aisyah Mustika [10617076]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dian Rosleine, S.Si., M.Si., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Biologi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Ilmu dan Teknologi Hayati", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Bamboo, biodiversity, plantation management, INBAR Global Survey, Bandung", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Sep 2021"}
