{"Nomor": 61850, "Judul": "RESERVOIR SIMULATION AND ECONOMIC MODEL EVALUATION FOR CO2 SEQUESTRATION WITH ENHANCED GAS RECOVERY IN FIELD X", "Abstrak": "With the approval of the Paris Agreement in 2015 by 197 countries, net zero emission had become an important\nfocus in energy sector as the one of emissions contributors to the atmosphere. It is the reason why the concept of\nZero Emission Power Plant (ZEPP) emerged. ZEPP is a power plant scenario which used gas from the reservoir\nas the main energy to produce electricity, then CO2 from gas combustion is injected to geological formations or\nknown as CO2 sequestration. These geological formations could be as gas reservoirs, oil reservoirs, saline aquifers,\nor coal seams. One of utility from CO2 sequestration is to increase production from a gas field that is still operating\nor known as CO2 Sequestration with Enhanced Gas Recovery (CSEGR). EGR by injecting CO2 is a technology\nwhich is still at very early stage in its development. By combining CO2 sequestration and Enhanced Gas Recovery,\nCO2 sequestration can be a promising business, by increasing the revenue from increasing the recovery factor of\ngas and benefit from CO2 sequestration. Indonesia should prepare for this by preparing a profit-sharing scheme\nthat attracts contractors to undertake this project.\nThis study presents the technical aspects of CO2 injection at CSEGR carried out with a compositional simulator\non a gas reservoir model to avoid technical problems. Then, an economic analysis of the CSEGR project is\npresented using the economic model schemes commonly used in Indonesia, which are PSC Cost Recovery and\nPSC Gross Split. From the calculation, the most profitable scheme, and modified economical model for the\nCSEGR project would be obtained to make the CSEGR project economical and attractive to launch.\nFrom this study, it is known that gas field reservoir simulation of field X shows that CSEGR could increase gas\nrecovery around 4%-12%. The proper well and perforation placement success to delay CO2 breakthrough to the\nend of field contract. The result of this study also shows that common PSC scheme that used in Indonesia gives a\nvery low NPV@10% and IRR compared to the no-injection case, because the NPV@10% and IRR sequestration\nresults are very low. It is also shown from the sensitivity analysis that the parameters that have the most influence\non the results of the NPV@10% sequestration are sequestration CAPEX, contractor split, and CO2 price. with\nsplit modifications, CO2 prices, and combining Cost Recovery and Gross Split can increase NPV@10% and IRR\nto numbers that are more attractive to contractors.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Muhammad Aqsal Ilham": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/236927"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Aqsal Ilham [12217033]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Dedy Irawan, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "CCUS, CSEGR, CO2 Sequestration, Enhanced Gas Recovery, Economic Evaluation", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Sep 2021"}
