However, single-objective optimization often could not meet the needs in practical application processes leading to multi-objective optimization problems which have better adaptability in practical applications. In this study, a new method for multi-objective well controls optimization problem using support-vector regression (SVR) proxy model and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) was developed. This method was named the multi-objective optimization with proxy model (MOO-PM). In the MOO-PM method, the net present value (NPV) and cumulative oil production (COP) were considered as the objective functions while the bottom hole pressure of production wells and water injection rate of injection wells were chosen as the optimization variables. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that SVR proxy model and NSGA-II are applied simultaneously to the optimization of well controls problems. Compared to reservoir simulation model, the SVR proxy model was computationally more efficient. This meant the large calculation time spent on reservoir simulation operation for multi-objective optimization was sharply reduced by using the SVR proxy model. Furthermore, the accuracy of the SVR proxy model was proved by comparing it to the results of simulation of optimized cases and non-optimized cases for a synthetic field as well as a real reservoir. It was concluded that MOO-PM method could obtain better results with higher efficiency.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lian Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["ZhiPing Li", "Caspar Daniel Adenutsi", "Liang Zhang", "FengPeng Lai", "KongJie Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Multi-objective optimization; Well control; Proxy model; NSGA-II", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 196, 2021, 107694, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920410520307592", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Jan 2022"}
