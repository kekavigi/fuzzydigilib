{"Nomor": 63169, "Judul": "A TIGHT SANDSTONE MULTI-PHYSICAL HYDRAULIC FRACTURES SIMULATOR STUDY AND ITS FIELD APPLICATION", "Abstrak": "During the past years, the recovery of unconventional gas formation has attracted lots of attention and achieved huge success. To produce gas from the low-permeability unconventional formations, hydraulic fracturing technology is essential and critical. In this paper, we present the development of a three-dimensional thermal-hydraulic-mechanical numerical simulator for the simulation of hydraulic fracturing operations in tight sandstone reservoirs. Our simulator is based on integrated finite difference (IFD) method. In this method, the simulation domain is subdivided into sub domains and the governing equations are integrated over a sub domain with flux terms expressed as an integral over the sub domain boundary using the divergence theorem. Our simulator conducts coupled thermal-hydraulic-mechanical simulation of the initiation and extension of hydraulic fractures. It also calculates the mass/heat transport of injected hydraulic fluids as well as proppants. Our simulator is able to handle anisotropic formations with multiple layers. Our simulator has been validated by comparing with an analytical solution as well as Ribeiro and Sharma model. Our model can simulate fracture spacing effect on fracture profile when combining IFD with Discontinuous Displacement Method (DDM).", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yonghong Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Binshan Ju", "Shihao Wang", "Zhenzhou Yang", "Qing Liu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Tight sandstone?; Hydraulic fracture simulator?; Integrated finite difference discretization?; Stress contrast", "Sumber": "Petroleum, Volume 6, Issue 2, 2020, Pages 198-205, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405656118302116", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Jan 2022"}
