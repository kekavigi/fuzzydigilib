In parallel, however, in achieving netzero\nemission by 2050 due to the Paris Agreement, Indonesia should reduce the atmosphere's gas emissions. The\ninjection of CO2 into coal reservoir known as CO2 Enhanced Coalbed Methane (CO2-E-CBM) has the potential\nfor CO2 storage and to improve gas recovery. This strategy might be one of the CO2 reduction options while\nallowing the continuous utilization of fossil fuels. However, increased methane recovery usually coupled with\nincreased economic costs make this project unattractive. Therefore, it is necessary to perform evaluation and\nresearch to evaluate CO2-E-CBM technically and economically feasible.\nThis thesis focused on analysing the model and economic model contract for CO2 injection for E-CBM using\nIndonesia's current Production Sharing Contract (PSC). At the same time, the benefit of CO2 stored was calculated\nusing the modification of the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) to become an Injection Sharing Contract (ISC).\nThis paper aims to find the most profitable economic model and best scenario to inject CO2 into the coalbed\nmethane reservoir.\nReservoir simulation studies were conducted for 20 years of production by performing simulations using CMG\nGEM. Several injection rate sensitivities were undertaken to find effects on the storage capacity and financial\nperformance. The study of the economic model contract refers to Indonesia's existing oil and gas contract model.\nFor gas production, the Production Sharing Contract is used. In contrast, For CO2 storage, the Injection sharing\ncontract scheme is based on modifying the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) Cost Recovery and PSC Gross\nSplit, resulting in Injection Sharing Contract Cost Recovery and Injection Sharing Contract Modified Gross Split.\nBased on technical analysis, a series of injection rate sensitivity explained the best scenario for CO2-E-CBM.\nScenario 35 MSCFD injection rate was chosen as the best scenario. The best case will be selected based on the\nscenario that provides the highest methane gas recovery, the highest value of CO2 storage, and injectant gas\nbreakthrough at a production well is no more than 7%. The best scenario gives the ratio of replacement of CO2\nmolecule to methane molecule is 1.7:1 (rounded 2:1). This scenario will duplicate to one field and continue to the\neconomic calculation. Then study sensitivity analysis for several fiscal parameters to find the most profitable\nmodel contract.\nFrom the economic calculation result, From the economic result, using Production Sharing Contract only, E-CBM\nproject were not economically advantageous. This is because of the cost of drilling additional wells as injection\nwells and the cost of injection operations. But when a Production Sharing Contract combines with an Injection\nSharing Contract, for both scheme Cost Recovery and Gross Split, the E-CBM project becomes more\neconomically advantageous because of the additional financial benefit of the incentives of CO2 storage associated\nwith the injection of CO2. The Gross Split model provides better economic returns for contractors. Economic\nsensitivity shows that several parameters such as CO2 price, gas price, and CAPEX have considerably influenced\nthe economy.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Iqbal Fauzi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250780"}, "Penulis": "Iqbal Fauzi [12218019]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Dedy Irawan, S.T., M.T.", "Pahala Dominicus Sinurat, S.T., M.Sc."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "CO2-E-CBM, Coalbed methane, PSC Scheme, ISC Scheme, Sensitivity Study.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Jun 2022"}
