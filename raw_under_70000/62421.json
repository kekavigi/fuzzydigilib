{"Nomor": 62421, "Judul": "IDENTIFICATION OF MINE TAILINGS OF ALLUVIAL TIN USING MULTITEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF LANDSAT IMAGES IN BANGKA ISLAND, INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "Unconventional and illegal mining activities in Bangka Island are a well-known problem in Indonesia's tin industry. Uncontrolled deforestation and a lack of tailing management are more damaging than beneficial to both nature and society. In this study, remote sensing methods were applied to differentiate the exploited from unexploited areas and tailings from non-tailings using multitemporal analysis of multispectral images from\nLandsat which validated by high-resolution aerial photographs. This study was conducted on three different unconventional mining sites that represent northern, central, and southern Bangka. A series of indices were used, including the normalized difference vegetation index to separate bare land from non-bare land: the modified\nnormalized difference water index was used to identify bodies of water. Further analysis was then conducted for the bare-land areas excluding bodies of water. The application of the Spectral Angle Mapper showed a distribution of tailing areas on the surface of these bare lands. These results were validated by ground-truth data information\n to create a distribution map of tailings and remaining alluvial tin resources at each mining sites.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Muslim Syamsul Bahri": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240102", "2018 MUSLIM SYAMSUL BAHRI 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240103", "2018 MUSLIM SYAMSUL BAHRI 1-TABLE OF CONTENTS.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240104", "2018 MUSLIM SYAMSUL BAHRI 1-PAPER.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240105"}, "Penulis": "Muslim Syamsul Bahri [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Arie Naftali Hawu Hede and Mohamad Nur Heriawan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "landsat, tailing management, deforestation", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani \u00a0\n                                     Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Des 2021"}
