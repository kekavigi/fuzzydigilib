{"Nomor": 61871, "Judul": "EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF WETTABILITY CHANGES IN ADDITION OF NANO-SILICA FOR SURFACTANT INJECTION", "Abstrak": "The most common method to approach a reservoir into water-wet is the enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technique. One of the most applied EOR methods today is surfactant-polymer injection. This injection process is highly dependent on flow characteristics, rock heterogeneity, and fluid-rock interactions. In comparison, injection with surfactants is a commonly used method for improving oil recovery because it may release oil trapped in porous media, while injection with water does not function effectively when the water content reaches 98 percent. Furthermore, now modern technology is needed to support the optimization of the EOR method, which is using the \"Nano Technology\" method. Nanotechnology has also been widely implemented in the oil and gas industry. However, to support that, the technology requires optimization, updates, and breakthroughs to affect the oil recovery process via the injection method substantially. This study was conducted to analyze the effect of nanosilica on changes in interfacial tension of surfactant injection using synthetic oil, using nanosilica and surfactants. The results of this research study indicate that the addition of nanosilica for surfactant injection has the ability to decrease wettability.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Moch.
