{"Nomor": 63798, "Judul": "INTEGRATION OF ACOUSTIC WELL SOUNDER APPLICATION AND GEOSTATISTICS SIMULATION TO PREDICT NEW WELL POSITIONING IN MATURE FIELD", "Abstrak": "Mature field development have many challenges to increase production rate of the field. One of the option to increase field production rate is drill new wells in area which is predicted has a good prospect. There are so many challenges that have to be overcome when a new well will be drilled, one of them is determination of well position. Challenges such as data limitation and the quality of data available will affect the determination of a new well positioning and will affect the rate of produced hydrocarbon.\nTo overcome so many challenges, geostatistics approach can be used. Geostatistics method can be used to estimate a value in various position and calculate the effect of previous data available. The value will be estimated from well testing result in some wells and then the well testing result will become a base to spread other value in interest position with drainage radius constraint. Based on that method, the determination of well position will become more accurate and the prediction value yield a more trusted result so a new well is hoped to yield a better productivity than well positioning method based on random determination. This study will analyze the position of a new well positioning in the best prospect area so the productivity of the field will be increased.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK William Kencana Tanjungan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/244742"}, "Penulis": "William Kencana Tanjungan [12210033]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
