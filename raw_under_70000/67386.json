{"Nomor": 67386, "Judul": "RAMS ANALYSIS OF METROKAPSUL BOGIE STEERING SYSTEM USING FAILURE MODES, EFFECTS, AND CRITICALITY ANALYSIS (FMECA)", "Abstrak": "Metrokapsul is categorized as an automated rubber-tire metro; it is currently still in its design and prototyping phases developed through collaboration between PT. TREKKA and PT. BAMEC. The transit of the vehicle is designed to function independently and without a driving personnel onboard as adhering to level 3 Grade of Operation (GoA); the steering is controlled by the course of the guide rail itself. The steering system is considered a very important aspect of the overall transportation system as it deals with both the transportation operation as well as its safety. An automatic steering feature would require a highly dependable system, assessing the Metrokapsul steering system in terms of its reliability, availability, maintainability, and safety (RAMS) is therefore necessary. One of the methods used by engineers and other quality assessment practitioners is the Failure Mode, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA). FMECA is a combination of Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Criticality Analysis (CA). FMEA by definition is a technique and tool for reliability improvement that aims to systematically identify and then prevent both known and potential failures that might arise from the product or system. The CA section is dedicated to ranking the priority of the identified system\u2019s components. The whole process is recorded systematically in tabular format for ease of reference in the future if similar failure occurs as it was either previously predicted or recorded in the past. The implementation of FMECA in the effort of the Metrokapsul bogie steering system RAMS assessment may provide a basis for various risk management, maintenance, and procurement works which include risk mitigation efforts, inspection routines, and creation of spare parts provisioning plan. Based on the FMECA result, this project also provides suggestions on the most critical parts of the Metrokapsul bogie steering system in terms of RAMS improvement.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Jonathan Michael Julius Junior": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/256151"}, "Penulis": "Jonathan Michael Julius Junior [13116231]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
