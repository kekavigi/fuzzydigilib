{"Nomor": 62406, "Judul": "ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVITY MONITORING AT WAYANG WINDU GEOTHERMAL FIELD USING A REMOTE SENSING APPLICATION", "Abstrak": "Remote sensing applications for environmental systems bring many benefits. They provide a variety of information derived from a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum that is easily manipulated in digital form and available at high spatial\nresolutions. Here, we present a study of environmental monitoring at the Wayang Windu\ngeothermal field using satellite optical imagery and high spatial resolution aerial photography. The hydrothermal system beneath the surface and the thermal activity surrounding the geothermal field at Wayang Windu can affect environmental conditions\nabove the surface. Using multi-temporal optical satellite imaging with Landsat 8 data in visible shortwave and thermal infrared imaging acquired between 2013 and 2017, we carried out a geobotanical remote sensing and analysis of land use/land cover (LULC) change. Our findings indicate changes in LULC related to geological phenomena for lower vegetation classes in certain areas. Further environmental monitoring could\nanalyze the vegetation index value and its changes.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Ahmad Dzulfikar Abdurrahman": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240059", "2018 AHMAD DZULFIKAR ABDURRAHMAN 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240060", "2018 AHMAD DZULFIKAR ABDURRAHMAN 1-TABLE OF CONTENTS.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240061", "2018 AHMAD DZULFIKAR ABDURRAHMAN 1-PAPER.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240071"}, "Penulis": "Ahmad Dzulfikar Abdurrahman [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Arie Naftali Hawu Hede and Mohamad Nur Heriawan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Teknik Pertambangan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Environmental monitoring, vegetation index, land use/land cover changes, geothermal", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "29 Des 2021"}
