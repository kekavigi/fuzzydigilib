However, the formation of an alkali scale potentially results in the reduction of the formation permeability and pipeline corrosion, which affect its industrial application. Recently, the surfactant/polymer (SP) flooding system in the absence of alkali has received increasing attention. Here, we screened a high-yielding strain, which is capable of producing salt-tolerant biopolymer. The results of rheological properties evaluation showed that this biopolymer possessed a stable viscosity at high salinities (up to 200\u00a0g/L NaCl, 100\u00a0g/L Ca2+, and 100\u00a0g/L Mg2+) and a wide range of pH (4\u201311), indicating its superior salt and pH resistance. Based on these properties, a novel salt-tolerant and alkali-free binary flooding system was constructed with this biopolymer and bio-based surfactant newly synthesized in our lab. The ultra-low interfacial tension (IFT) between crude oil and the binary system containing 0.5\u00a0wt % biopolymer and 1.00\u00a0g/L surfactant could be achieved in the presence of 100\u00a0g/L NaCl or 400\u00a0mg/L Ca2+. Moreover, it exhibited good resistance to oil sands adsorption, excellent anti-dilution, and ageing stability. These results indicate that the biopolymer produced by the Kosakonia oryzae strain possessed great potential in the construction of an alkali-free SP system for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in high salinity and high temperature oil reservoirs.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Meng-Ru Ge [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Si-Jia Miao", "Jin-Feng Liu", "Hong-Ze Gang", "Shi-Zhong Yang", "Bo-Zhong Mu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Biopolymer/surfactant formula; Ultra-low interfacial tension; Enhanced oil recovery; Salt-tolerant; Alkali-free", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 196, 2021, 107736, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920410520307993", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Feb 2022"}
