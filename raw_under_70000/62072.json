More over self evaluation\nand performance management are not well developed in school environment to\noperate in a competitive education market and lack of standard regarding definition,\nclassification, and usage of specific tools make both research and application of\nperformance management principles difficult. Consequently, Indonesian business\nand management school need a PMS framework that could be used as facilitator and\ntools for self assessment of business and management school in enhancing\nperformance based on existing condition, i.e. accredited by BAN-PT to the world\nclass business and management school accredited by international agency, such as\nAACSB, EQUIS, or ABEST2.\nSince human aspect in the input, process, and output could be occurred at once in\nbusiness and management school, therefore it would be not easy and needs\ncomplexity stages in designing and implementing PMS. The PMS should also be\nready for different situation. However, the school of business and management\ncannot be directly copying and just adopting without making any adaptations of\nPMSs since it would create difficulties to be implemented for practitioners.\nMoreover most of the published performance management systems focus on\nmanufacturing environment, only a few studies on this area look into the context of\nbusiness and management school and the implementation of PMS in business and\nmanagement school is very limited and stills a challenge. So, this research propose\nPMS design for school of business and management from top to bottom management\nthat conducted to help Indonesian business school and management in increasing\ntheir competitiveness.\nThe research is conducted by using exploratory study and a case study research\nmethodology was used to develop a conceptual model based upon literature review.\nii\nA case study approach also was used to investigate the way in which PMS actually\nevolve within school of business and management environment. Inductive theorybuilding\nwas done by a series of survey and interview to the practitioners in school to\npropose design of performance management. Explanatory study was done to\ndetermine relationship among variables and survey instrumentation to eleven\nIndonesian Business Schools that meet several characteristics. Pre-test was done to\nensure the content of questionnaire is understandable and also show acceptable level\nof reliability. Confirmatory study will be done in order to be able to address the issue\nof business school and management performance in detail; the performance variables\nvalidation is confined to three Indonesian Business Schools that meet several\ncharacteristics.\nThe research provides a PMS Model developed by considering four performance\nlevels (1) Foundation, (2) Basic Information, (3) Designing PMS, (4) Mechanism of\nperformance measurement, with three perspectives for school of business and\nmanagement performance: Organizational Result Perspective, Internal Process\nPerspective, and Resource Capabilities Perspectives, and it consists of sixteen\nperformance variables that consist of 50 priority indicators and 87 supporting\nindicators. The model integrates the managing of performance across these three\nlevels through key areas of potential improvement and benchmarking standards\nqualitatively and quantitatively. The research limitations are regarding the\nadjustment that should be made for the certain performance variable and their related\nknowledge based to be implemented in the other environments.", "Daftar File": {"2014 DS PP ANTON MULYONO 1 -FULL CHAPTER.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/238505"}, "Penulis": "Anton Mulyono Azis [39008304]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
