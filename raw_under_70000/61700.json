In Indonesia, CCS is still a brand new issue. Speaking of which, Standard assessment for subsurface parameter to execute CCS project in Area ?G? is necessary in order to have further implementation. Risk Management for subsurface parameter is essential for CCS project in Area ?G? because this will reduce the risk and uncertainties in developing through the next step. There are two organizations which has compiled the general standard for accomplishing CCS project. This study discusses about standard and Risk management implementation in CCS project in Area ?G?.\nIn this study, author use DNV-RP-J203 as the standard because author sees this recommended practice is more systematic and easy to be implemented. Every step of project standardization is described clearly; screening, appraisal, permitting and risk management. From the result of subsurface parameter screening, Area ?G? is not fulfil the minimum requirement according to the standard of CCS project because there are still many subsurface parameters which not met standard requirements given by CSA Z471-12 and DNV-RP-J2013. In the other hand, risk management assessment shows many risks for continuing CCS project in Area ?G?. But, proper treatment of risks will gradually decrease the likeliness of the risk to happen and Area ?G? will be categorized as a good CCS storage site. Those description simplifies the standard definition for CCS project in Area ?G?. By applying the CCS standard in Area ?G?, it is expected that further development of CCS in Indonesia can easily be applied and implemented for any other CCS project in other region in Indonesia in harmony with iterative screening process of standard and the assessment of risk management in every gathered data with better quality.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Andika Wirayudha": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/236727"}, "Penulis": "Andika Wirayudha [12210046]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
