{"Nomor": 62231, "Judul": "GOLD VEIN RESOURCES MODELING USING INDICATOR KRIGING AND SEGUENTIAL INDICATOR SIMULATION METHODS, CASE STUDY OF PONGKOR GOLD VEIN", "Abstrak": "This study discusses gold vein resources modeling using the principle of indicator estimation, i.e. Indicator Kriging (IK) and Seviential Indicator Simulation (SIS) for Au\ngrade of gold vein mineralization at Mt. Pongkor, West Jawa, Indonesia. The data used in this study is from exploration drilling of 136 data. Exploratory data analysis indicates that the available data with relatively wide range of 50 m in average toward the strike of gold vein data seems not proportional to the volume of ore bodies. The data set consists of some outliers. The estimation and simulation of Au grade was conducted using IK and SIS with two algorithms, i.e. Full Indicator Kriging (FIK) and Median Indicator Kriging (MIK). The probability plot and grade-tonnage curves for nine cut-off grades were displayed in order to validate the results of the estimated and simulated grade to the actual composited grade within block. From this study we could conclude that IK method with FIK algorithm was the most accurate method for the gold vein resources estimation.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Mohamad Nur Heriawan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/239764", "DAFTAR Mohamad Nur Heriawan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/239765", "2016 MOHAMAD NUR HERIAWAN 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/239766", "2016 MOHAMAD NUR HERIAWAN 1-PAPER.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/239767"}, "Penulis": "Mohamad Nur Heriawan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Samuel Rivai Sitindaon, Dwi Margianto, Romzi Rio Wibawa"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "indicator kriging, sequential indicator simulation, full indicator kriging, the median indicator kriging, Grade-Tonnage Curves", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani \u00a0\n                                     Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Des 2021"}
