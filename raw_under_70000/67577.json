{"Nomor": 67577, "Judul": "A SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION OF MANAGED PRESSURE DRILLING WITH CONSTANT BOTTOM HOLE PRESSURE TECHNOLOGY THAT APPLIED IN NARROW OPERATING WINDOWS WHICH OTHERWISE NOT DRILLABLE: A CASE STUDY IN NORTH SUMATERA EXPLORATION WELL", "Abstrak": "Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) is a drilling adaptation method that focuses on controlling the annular pressure in a wellbore so that it is always slightly above the pore pressure (slightly overbalanced) and was developed over the last few years to overcome common problems that often occur in offshore and onshore wells. This MPD method has several variations, each used in different well conditions with situational challenges such as narrow pressure windows, total lost circulation, and high-pressure high-temperature wells. The variations are Constant Bottom Hole Pressure (CBHP), Dual Gradient Drilling (DGD), Pressurized Mud Cap Drilling (PMCD), and closed system MPD.\nIn this study, the Constant Bottom Hole Pressure (CBHP) method is used to minimize common problems found in well \"X\" such as kick/influx, differential pressure sticking, and lost circulation by using equipment such as chokes, rotating control devices (RCD) and surface backpressure pump (SBP) on the well surface. This equipment is used to adjust and compensate for the annular friction pressure lost due to drilling activities so that the hydrostatic pressure of the mud remains within a safe margin pressure window.\nBy conducting several sensitivity analysis simulations on two hole sections 12 1/4\" and 8 3/8\", it is obtained that applying the MPD method is proven to reduce the costs required for these wells. Using CBHP can significantly reduce the density of the drilling fluid used in this well to produce a relatively efficient rate of penetration (ROP) and reduce Non-Productive Time (NPT) in drilling activities.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Jonathan Benediktus": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/256634"}, "Penulis": "Jonathan Benediktus [12218092]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dimas Taha Maulana, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "MPD, Annular Pressure, Constant Bottomhole Pressure, Narrow Pressure Window", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Agu 2022"}
