{"Nomor": 66131, "Judul": "NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF WATER CONING IN NATURALLY FRACTURED GAS RESERVOIR", "Abstrak": "The increasing need for oil and gas products is a rising challenge that cannot be avoided by oil and gas-producing\ncountries. In Indonesia, the gas consumption in Indonesia increased yearly while the production supplies have\ncontinuously decreased since 2010. Therefore, preventing excessive water production is one of the answers to\nincreasing gas production. One of the critical reasons for excessive water production is cone formation.\nWater coning is the potential for the water at the local gas-water contact to rise vertically until it eventually breaks\nthrough the perforation in the well. The critical rate is called the limiting rate that will cause cone instability and\nwater breakthrough.\nThis study uses a simulation of water coning behavior on a vertical well by comparing the time to water\nbreakthrough on water saturation performance and cumulative water production based on five parameters. The\nparameters that could have a significant impact on how water production behaves were chosen, and potential\nadjustment ranges were identified. A CMG program was created for each of the predetermined combinations of\nthe chosen parameters, getting the water production in the center well as a function of operational period of the\nwell.\nThe results of this study predict that water imbibition from fractures to the matrix and pressure drop significantly\ninfluences water coning behavior with all sensitivity parameters consistent with the published literature. The\nreduced water coning could be achieved on a high permeability fracture to matrix ratio and by increasing the\ndistance of the deepest perforation to WGC.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Annisa Salsabila": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250591"}, "Penulis": "Annisa Salsabila [12218082]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
