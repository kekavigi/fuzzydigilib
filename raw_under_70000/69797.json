{"Nomor": 69797, "Judul": "EFFECTIVE BUILDING CONFIGURATION ALONG VENTILATION CORRIDOR TO MITIGATE URBAN HEAT ISLAND (UHI) IN BANDUNG CITY, INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "According to the United Nations, 54 percent of the world\u2019s population residing in\nurban areas in 2014. The increasing development due to urbanization has also\nincreased the urban heat island. The density that keeps increasing and temperature that\nkeeps rising, will this lead to bigger catastrophe? The urbanization, happening since the\nindustrial revolution, keep increasing along with the ratio of the population that live in\nurban areas compare to the rural areas. Previous studies claim the important roles of\nbuilding configuration roles in mitigating the heat factor. Sustainable development\nshould be a planner\u2019s consideration when planning the city to ensure both economic\ngrowth and good living environments for future generations. However, current studies in\nmitigating urban heat island through wind corridor have mostly been conducted on small\nscale and not in the urban planning stage. The study aims to contribute to the body of\nknowledge by assessing the wind corridor on an urban scale using a different approach\nby combining more data such as, land use; land temperature; spatial plan; and urban\nconfiguration and incorporate the findings into policy.\n12\nTherefore, this research discusses the urban configuration to mitigate heat island\neffect, focusing in Bandung City in Indonesia as one of the urban areas that grows\nrapidly in developing country in Asia. Considering urban configuration along the wind\ncorridor in early stages of planning will add a valuable benefit to future thermal comfort\nand energy usage of urban dwellers. In practice, this research hopes to be a valuable\ninput for planners and policy makers when planning growing urban area to ensure\nsustainable urban development.\nThe main argument of the research is the effective urban configuration in the\nurban scale will help to mitigate heat island effect which will lead to a significant input to\nreduce urban energy consumption. As the result, it hopes to help others to understand\nthe importance of the urban configuration and help to improve the thermal comfort by\napplying the effective urban configuration that often overlooks in the urban planning\nprocess.", "Daftar File": {"2018 TS PP ELIANA_TESIS.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/267487"}, "Penulis": "Eliana [25415029]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
