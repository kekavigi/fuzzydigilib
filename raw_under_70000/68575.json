{"Nomor": 68575, "Judul": "HEAT TRANSFER ANALYSIS OF AIR COOLED BATTERY PACK", "Abstrak": "A battery pack stores energy that will later be used as a power source for electric vehicles. However, when compared to an internal combustion engine, it has some disadvantages. One of the most obvious disadvantages is that the battery's temperature rises faster when it starts discharging at high rates, making it more susceptible to damage from extreme temperatures. This combination of high and abnormal temperatures will damage the battery, shorten its life, and jeopardize the user's safety. As a result, a battery thermal management system is required to keep the temperature stable. The battery thermal management system in this case will be an air cooling system. As a result, additional research into this air cooling system is needed to achieve optimal performance with the available technology and cost.\nThe study would focus on the formations of the battery cell as well as the number of cells used in the battery pack. The two formations that were tested were the inline formation and the staggered formation. While the number of battery cells to be tested is determined by the row of battery cells, which is divided into two situations: short row and long row. As a result, Computational Fluid Dynamic would be used in this study to observe the phenomenon and its outcomes. The Finite Element Method would be used to observe. The simulation would focus on investigating the heat transfer rate and maintaining the overall temperature of the battery pack using airflow simulation.\nThe simulation shows that an air cooling system, either inline or staggered, can be used to cool both or only one of the formations, depending on the circumstances. The result in the special case condition, which is only possible in the aligned formation, is the only significant difference between the two. While staggered formation is possible, the results in special conditions show the risk that the cell may face if an extreme condition occurs.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Helmi Fauzan Widjanarko": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/259296"}, "Penulis": "Helmi Fauzan Widjanarko [13117214]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Bentang Arief Budiman, S.T., M.Eng.", "Poetro Lebdo Sambegoro, M.Sc., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Mesin", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Battery, BTMS, CFD, Finite Element Method, Electric Vehicle", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "16 Sep 2022"}
