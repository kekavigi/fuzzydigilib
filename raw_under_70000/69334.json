{"Nomor": 69334, "Judul": "FEASIBILITY STUDY OF DRONE DELIVERY IN INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "Drone technology is starting to disrupt today\u2019s business. with advancing drone technologies introduced each day drones can significantly accelerate delivery times and reduce the human cost associated with the delivery. By looking into some successful drone companies, drones can be used to connect remote areas and bypass traffic. However, it raises the question of why it is only available in some countries. Furthermore, is it possible to implement such business operations inside Indonesia? These questions are answered through a feasibility study. At first potential markets are determined by assessing the values of existing businesses. Next, technical feasibility is done by matching current technology with existing regulations. Last, the profitability of the business is assessed by comparing the price and delivery time between drones and other competitors.\nBy analyzing several drone delivery companies, 2 types of business values are identified. The first is to connect hard-to-reach areas and the second one is to bypass traffic congestion inside an urban area. it\u2019s seen that drone technology is eligible to be utilized in both market conditions. In addition, regulation can be forced if the value created outperforms risk. Hence, by examining these 2 companies, 2 potential markets able to be identified mainly inside Papua area which has similar market characteristics as Zipline, and Jakarta, which is similar to Matternets. Research shows that operationally it\u2019s feasible to implement drone delivery business in Indonesia by addressing market, legal, and technology consideration. However, financially drone delivery is not feasible due to expensive service driven by low volume. Furthermore, comparative company analysis shows that when drones reach optimal quantity orders, the average delivery cost 2.5 times more than motorcycle delivery.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Stefanus Gunawan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/260453"}, "Penulis": "Stefanus Gunawan [13618035]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Taufiq Mulyanto, S.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "UAV, Drone delivery, market analysis, technical feasibility study, Profitability.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Sep 2022"}
