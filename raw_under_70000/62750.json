{"Nomor": 62750, "Judul": "RHEOLOGY AND STABILITY OF NANOPARTICLE-STABILIZED CO2 FOAM UNDER RESERVOIR CONDITIONS", "Abstrak": "This study investigates the rheology and stability of nanoparticle-stabilized CO2 foams under reservoir conditions (high temperature and high pressure) for fracturing applications. The effects of different parameters on foam apparent viscosity and foam stability were experimentally investigated including the effects of nanoparticle concentration, salinity, foam quality (?), shear rate and temperature. The power law model was applied to calculate foam apparent viscosity owing to its pseudo-plastic behavior, and the changes of foam heights over time were used to evaluate foam stability. Results showed that the CO2 foam apparent viscosity featured a mountain-shaped curve versus ?, with the peak apparent viscosity obtained at 70% foam quality. The increase of salinity (up to 11%) in the continuous phase improved both foam stability and rheology. Higher nanoparticle concentration could contribute to better foam stability, but there was a threshold concentration, above which the foam apparent viscosity remained stabilized. The CO2 foam stabilized by nanoparticles displayed a shear-thickening behavior as the experiment flow rate increased from 6\u00a0mL/min to 18\u00a0mL/min. Further studies showed that as the total flow rate increased, the CO2 foam became finer-textured with better stability. Elevated temperatures could undermine foam apparent viscosity and long-term stability. The results of this study could provide guidelines as to the design of foam fracturing systems for field applications.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Chunkai Fu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ning Liu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Nanoparticle; Apparent viscosity; Foam stability; CO2 foam", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 196, 2021, 107671, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920410520307385", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Jan 2022"}
