{"Nomor": 61252, "Judul": "STRUCTURAL PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION OF REINFORCED CONCRETE BRIDGES WITH SINGLE CONCAVE FRICTION PENDULUM BEARINGS", "Abstrak": "Bridge is a life-sustaining structure which acts as an important connector in terrestrial transportation networks. As a simple structure, bridge is quite prone to seismic damages. Earthquake-prone countries have been applying seismic isolation methods to prevent excessive damages to bridge structures. Since Kobe Earthquake in 1995, construction of base-isolated structures has significantly increased from 10 buildings to 150 buildings per year. For common type of bridges, elastomeric bearings have been greatly used as an isolation system. Elastomeric bearings offer low maintenance costs and thus have been used in New Zealand, Japan, and the United States for more than 20 years. In the other hand, elastomeric bearing is ineffective under large displacement and low temperatures. Large diameter to accommodate displacement will result in higher stiffness. Moreover, low temperatures may result in crystallization in elastomeric component. Frictional sliding bearing can overcome these problems, but the usage is still uncommon, and the behaviour has not been explored further.\nThe aim of this study is to compare seismic performance of conventional bridges and SCFPB-isolated bridges under the same ground motions, determine the most optimum friction design of SCFPB with most favorable responses, and determine the impact of structural weight to the behaviour of the isolation system.\nTwelve FEM bridge models which situated in Jakarta with soft soil conditions are studied. Seven pairs of ground motion data are used for nonlinear time history analysis (NLTHA). Parameters to be compared in this study are number of plastic hinges formed, base shear forces, deck absolute acceleration, and isolator lateral deformation under design spectral-matched ground motion scenarios.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK JAMES MICHAEL": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/236081"}, "Penulis": "JAMES MICHAEL [25020065]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
