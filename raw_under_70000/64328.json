{"Nomor": 64328, "Judul": "NON-ISOTHERMAL KINETICS ANALYSIS OF VARIOUS INDONESIAN COAL THERMAL CHARACTERISTICS FOR UNDERGROUND COAL GASIFICATION PURPOSES", "Abstrak": "Indonesia has abundant coal resources. However, some of the coal is difficult to be mined because of its\nlocation. Some are too far below the soil surface, or also called Deep Seated Coal (DSC). Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) is an alternative Clean Coal Technology that carried out gasification underground, thus it may have a potential explore DSC. The primary assessment of underground gasification may be started from a simple thermal analysis. This paper presents those assessment on the characteristics of gasification for further prospects of underground coal gasification implementation in Indonesia. The gasification experiments were carried out in a Thermogravimetric Analyser by using ten samples of coal from various locations in Indonesia. The experimental parameters include gasification media (CO2 or air) at temperature ranges from 35\u00b0C to 900\u00b0C and a heating rate of 10\u00b0C/min. The\ngasification media is passed at a rate of 100mL/min. Data of weight loss of sample were obtained from this experiment. From the experimental results, Arrhenius constants obtained on gasification with air are in the range 55643 to 114245 min-1 with the activation energy of 46.26 to 96.98 kJ/mol. Meanwhile, the gasification with CO2 yields Arrhenius constant 15301 up to 61339 min-1 and the activation energy of 12.72 to 109.71 kJ/mol. Those kinetics data provide the basic information for further exploring the possibility of underground coal gasification.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Winny Wulandari": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246368", "2019 WINNY WULANDARI 1-PAPER.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246369"}, "Penulis": "Winny Wulandari [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dwiwahju Sasongko, Jenny Rizkiana, Komang Anggayana, Agus Haris Widayat, Aghietyas Choirun Az Zahra and Muhammad Agung Azhari"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Deep Seated Coal (DSC), gasification, Thermogravimetric Analyser", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Mei 2022"}
