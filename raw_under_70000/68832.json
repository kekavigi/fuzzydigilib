{"Nomor": 68832, "Judul": "PERANCANGAN SISTEM PLAMBING (AIR BERSIH, AIR BUANGAN, VENT, AIR HUJAN, DAN SISTEM PEMADAM KEBAKARAN) PADA GEDUNG PERPUSTAKAAN UMUM KOTA BANDUNG", "Abstrak": "The Bandung City Public Library building consists of two buildings, namely the library\nbuilding which has 5 floors with 1 basement and the auditorium building which consists of 1\nfloor. In designing the plumbing system for clean water, recycled water, waste water, vents,\nrainwater, and fire extinguishing systems, the SNI 8153:2015 standard on Plumbing Systems\nin Buildings is used. The source of clean water from this building uses PDAM water with a\ncapacity of 36.94 m3 per day. Thus, the lower reservoir is planned for 27 m3 and 15 m3 for\nthe upper reservoir. For recycled water that comes from used gray water produced by floor\ndrains, sinks, and lavatory then processed first at the STP in the basement and also from\nrainwater that is not treated first, a lower reservoir is planned for 24.75 m3 and 15 m3, but in\ntheir use, recycled water is only used in the flushing process for the plumbing water closet. The\nwater used is accommodated in the ground water tank which is in the basement and the roof\ntank which is on the roof floor. Clean water, recycled water and water for fire fighting systems\nhave their own or separate tanks to maintain the quality and quantity of water required for each\nsystem. For the waste water system, a separate system is used, where gray water and black\nwater have different pipes, because gray water will be flowed to STP to be treated as recycled\nwater, and black water is directly channeled to the city's real pipe. For the vent system, a loop\nsystem is used, in which the vent can serve a maximum of 8 plumbing devices, and is channeled\nto the top of the building. Rainwater is piped using a gravity system, which is then routed to\nrecycled tanks for water use. The library building is classified as a light fire hazard and the\nbuilding construction is not flammable, so the fire extinguishing system uses automatic\nsprinklers and fire extinguishers", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Salma Azaria Al-Amin": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/259627"}, "Penulis": "Salma Azaria Al-Amin [15718028]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
