{"Nomor": 62683, "Judul": "IDENTIFICATION OF PYRITE EXISTENCE ON OVERBURDEN AND INTERBURDEN COAL LAYER IN RELATION OF ACID MINE WATER FORMING ON AIR LAYA, PT BUKIT ASAM, SOUTH SUMATERA", "Abstrak": "Acid Mine Water occurs when there are three media, namely 1) Mineral sulfide as sources of sulfur or acid, 2) oxygen as oxidizer, 3) water as a result of oxidation washers (Gautama, 2012). According Caruccio et al (1988), every form of sulfur have different reactivity. Pyrite framboidal is one of pyrite form that have large surface and very reactive. So the ability of pyrite framboidal oxidation is faster than any other form. In general, this study analyzed 30 samples of core drilling in the Air Laya area. Observations were made with a physical description and microscopic observation with magnification 100x objective for the early identification of the occurrence of pyrite, then clarified with Static Test, Kinetic Test and XRD to increase the confidence level of analysis and study of the characteristics of pyrite in more depth. Results of this study indicate that there are samples contained pyrite with framboidal form. Based on a Static Test and Kinetic Test it can be seen lining on OB Al , IB Al -A2, IB A2- B Bl-B2 TB, D3 and IB B2-C CD is dominated by potential acid forming rock and on IB B2-C is dominated by non potential acid forming. So that on the Air Laya area has the potential for acid mine water forming.", "Daftar File": {"2015 ELIZZAH RAHMATIKA 1-ABSTRACT.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/241342", "2015 ELIZZAH RAHMATIKA 1-PRESENTATION.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/241344", "COVER Elizzah Rahmatika": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/241396", "2015 ELLIZAH RAHMATIKA 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/241397", "2015 ELLIZAH RAHMATIKA 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/241398"}, "Penulis": "Elizzah Rahmatika [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Syafrizal and Agus Haris Widayat"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Acid mine water, static test, kinetic test", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "5 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Jan 2022"}
