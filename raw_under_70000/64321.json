{"Nomor": 64321, "Judul": "HYDROCARBON GENERATION POTENTIAL OF INDONESIAN COALS: FROM THE VIEWPOINTS OF ORGANIC PETROLOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY", "Abstrak": "Indonesia has many coal basins as the result of intensive tectonic activity in the geologic past. Petrographical analysis showed that the organic components were mainly dominated by vitrinite maceral group, followed by low to moderate of liptinite and inertinite maceral groups. Reflectance measured on the vitrinite maceral placing the coals into lignite to bituminous ranks. The coals have a good to excellent of total organic carbon (TOC) content. Experiment results indicate that the coals could have contributed to hydrocarbon accumulation.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Komang Anggayana": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246352", "2014 KOMANG ANGGAYANA 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246353", "2014 KOMANG ANGGAYANA 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246354", "2014 KOMANG ANGGAYANA 1-PAPER.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246355"}, "Penulis": "Komang Anggayana [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mulyono Dwiantoro, Agus Haris Widayat"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "hydrocarbon, petrographical, total organic carbon (TOC)", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Mei 2022"}
