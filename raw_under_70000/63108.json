The worldwide rise of T2DM with global prevalence in adults of 8.8% per 2017 of the world population, along with the further anticipated 9.9% increase by 2045 indicated its severity and potential risk of being a major health concern. Diet and physical activity remain a critical foci and integral part in maintaining blood glucose management, thus indicating the pivotal role between nutrition, lifestyle, and T2DM management. Tongka Langit (TL) (Musa troglodytarum L.), an indigenous banana cultivar to the island of Maluku in East Indonesia, is believed to have healing properties. High content of ?-carotene and vitamin A in TL may have potency in reducing inflammation via its modulatory activity of the innate immune system, thus regular consumption may be beneficial as therapeutic agent to reduce inflammation in people with T2DM. Its specific modulation however, was not fully understood. Transcriptomic analysis was performed to determine how TL modulates the complement cascade, as part of the innate immunity. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) total gut RNA samples was classified into control (NL), overfeed Cavendish (OF), and overfeed+Tongka Langit supplemented (OFTL) groups. Reads were quality-checked and preprocessed to access clean reads using FastQC v.0.11.9 and Cutadapt v2.8. Sequence alignment was performed with BWA \u2013mem on Danio rerio GRCz11 reference. Mapped reads were quantified using HTSeq-Count v0.11.1. Gene expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 with L2FC>|1|and FDR<0.01 threshold. Result suggested that NL vs. OF showed 43 significantly modulated genes, with zbtb16a the most significantly down-regulated gene. zbtb16a was reported to be regulator that may suppress inflammation via TLR signaling in innate immunity. NL vs. OFTL showed 384 modulated genes with multiple complement components identified (masp1, masp2, c1r, cfb, c3a.1, c3a.2, c3a.3, .c3a.6, cfh, cfhl, cfhl1, cfhl4, cfhl5, c5,c7, c8a, c8b, c9, vtnb). OF vs. OFTL showed 51 modulated genes with C3a.2 and cfb, also being recognized as parts of complement component. Enrichment analysis using DAVID, IDEP, and GeneMania web-based software showed modulated complement component found in NL vs. OFTL and OF vs. OFTL to share similar biological process and functionality. Pathway analysis using REACTOME showed NL vs. OFTL modulate complement cascading via initial triggering, C3-C5 activation, and terminal complement, while OF vs. OFTL modulate via C3 activation. Similarities of C3a.2 and cfb down-regulation found in NL vs. OFTL and OF vs. OFTL showed possible modulation of complement cascading by TL via down-regulation of C3 and C3 convertase, thus providing potential in reducing inflammation in therapeutic sense in T2DM induced zebrafish.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Juan Dennis Bahrian": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242114"}, "Penulis": "Juan Dennis Bahrian [10617006]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Indra Wibowo, S.Si., M.Sc.", "Popi Septiani, S.Si., M.Si."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Biologi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Ilmu dan Teknologi Hayati", "Subjek": "Life sciences ; biology", "Kata Kunci": "Transcriptomic analysis, TD2M, Complement cascade, ?-carotene, Carotenoids", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan \u00a0\n                                     Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Jan 2022"}
