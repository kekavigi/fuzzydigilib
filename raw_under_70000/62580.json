{"Nomor": 62580, "Judul": "EFFECTS OF LOW FREQUENCY EXTERNAL EXCITATION ON OIL SLUG MOBILIZATION AND FLOW IN A WATER SATURATED CAPILLARY MODEL", "Abstrak": "The present research is to experimentally study the joint effects of external pressure and vibratory excitations of\nlow frequency on oil slug mobilization and flow in a capillary model. During and after the oil slug mobilization,\nthe flow phenomena and pressure drop variation across the model are investigated. The distance travelled by the\noil slug subjected to various external pressure and vibratory excitations are also studied. The experimental\nresults obtained indicate that the external vibratory excitation acting on the model has positive effect on the flow\nand mobilization of the oil slug in the model. It is found in the research, with the application of the excitation,\nthe contact angle between the oil slug and tube-wall is changed; the maximum pressure required to mobilize the\noil slug is reduced accordingly; and the oil slug travel distance is increased in comparing with that without\nexternal excitations. This research contributes to the comprehension of improved liquid mobilization in porous\nmedia under the application of external excitations. The finding of the research is significant for studying the\ntwo-phase liquid flow in porous media subjected to external excitations and provides insights for Enhanced Oil\nRecovery with waterflooding and vibratory stimulations.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "LIMING DAI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yihe Zhang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Oil slug mobilization, Vibratory excitation, Liquid mobilization, Porous media, Capillary model, Low frequency stimulation", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 5, Issue 4, Pages 375-381 (December 2019), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2019.03.001", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Jan 2022"}
