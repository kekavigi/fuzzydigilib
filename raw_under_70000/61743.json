{"Nomor": 61743, "Judul": "ANALISIS MUSIMAN KONSENTRASI NO2 DAN O3 DI PULAU JAWA MENGGUNAKAN SATELIT SENTINEL-5P", "Abstrak": "Photochemical oxidants are one of the issues with urban air pollution. Ozone (O3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are two gases that have a significant impact on human health. High population density can lead to increased usage of vehicles and industrial activities, rising NO2 and O3 concentrations. The existence of meteorological conditions can influence the distribution NO2 and O3 concentrations. Therefore, this study investigate the relationship between NO2, O3 and meteorological parameters such as temperature, radiation, precipitation, and wind, particularly in numerous places on the Java Island.\nThe Sentinel-5 Precursor Satellite provided NO2 and O3 concentration data with a spatial resolution of 0.01\u00ba\u00d70.01\u00ba and a temporal resolution of per month for this study. UV radiation, surface temperature, wind direction and speed were collected from ERA-5 reanalysis data, while precipitation data was obtained from the Global Precipitation Measurement System (GPM). The data is divided into two periods, DJF and JJA, and then spatially and temporally processed to observe seasonal trends, as well as divided into six research areas to produce correlation values to determine the relationship between the parameters. These findings can be used to determine which areas of NO2 and O3 concentrations are affected by climatic conditions, as well as which variables influence NO2 and O3.\nThis study show that the concentration of NO2 have little variation throughout the year, when O3 concentration showing a significant seasonal variations. The concentration of NO2 and O3 in Java in the months of DJF and JJA in 2019 \u2013 2020 exhibit a weak correlation. The areas with the largest correlation between meteorological factors and NO2 located in big cities, such as Jakarta, meanwhile Banyuwangi has the highest correlation of meteorological factors with O3. Wind speed and UV radiation have the strongest correlations with O3 concentrations, however meteorological parameters did not show significant relation on NO2 concentrations.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Luthfiyyah Haniffariyani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/236779"}, "Penulis": "Luthfiyyah Haniffariyani [12817022]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dra.
