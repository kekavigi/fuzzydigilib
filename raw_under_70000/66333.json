There\nis a gap between the spectacular qualities of nanotechnology and nanotoxicity,\nwhich should be bridged in order to assure the safety of nanomaterials in human\nhealth. Phyllanthus niruri is a medicinal plant that has traditionally been used as\nan anti-malarial, dissolving kidney stones and immunomodulator. The present\nwork was determined to investigate potential cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of\nPhyllanthus niruri extract loaded nanoparticles (PNNP) and Phyllanthus niruri\nextract nanoemulsions (PNNE) on mouse Sertoli cell line (TM4) and their\npotential adverse impact on spermatogenesis.\nThe study concept is to formulate and characterize chitosan nanoparticles loaded\nwith Phyllanthus niruri extract, as well as Phyllanthus niruri nanoemulsions of\ntwo sizes. The cytotoxicity on Sertoli cells was determined using a colorimetric\ntechnique, Cell Counting Kit-8. The cell viability of blank (empty) nanoemulsions\nand blank nanoparticles was determined by trypan blue exclusion dye staining.\nFast halo and comet assays were used to quantify single-strand DNA breaks\n(SSBs) in Sertoli cells to determine potential genotoxicity of Phyllanthus niruri\nnanomaterials (nanoparticles and nanoemulsions). To detect changes in cell\nmorphology during apoptosis, Hoechst 33342 staining was performed. An\nimmunofluorescence assay was used to examine the expression of blood-testis\nbarrier (BTB) proteins (connexin 43, claudin 11) in TM4 cells after exposure to\nPNNP 125 ppm and PNNE with diameters of 163.7 nm and 16.9 nm at a\nconcentration of 125 ppm.\nAccording to the findings, the synthesized PNNP has good characteristics such as\na NP size of 170.6 nm, a polydispersity index (PI) of 0.269, a Zeta potential of\n+37.8 mv, and a good entrapment efficiency (EE) of 71.0%. PNNE was\nsuccessfully formulated with two diameters of 163.7 nm and 16.9 nm, a\npolydispersity index (PI) of 0.291 and 0.181, a zeta potential of -9.1 mv and -5.7\nmv, and a high entrapment efficiency (EE %) of 89% and 93%. The results\nshowed that PNNP and PNNE exposure induce DNA damage in Sertoli cell line\n(TM4), as determined by Fast halo and Comet assays, as well as apoptosis, as\ndetermined by changes in cell morphology as confirmed by Hoechst 33342\nstaining. There was significant down regulation of BTB proteins in Sertoli cells\nafter exposure to PNNP, PNNE at concentration of 125 ppm which could\ncompromise the integrity of BTB and subsequently disrupt spermatogenesis\nprocess in male.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Ebrahim Saad Ebrahim Sadaqa": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250914"}, "Penulis": "Ebrahim Saad Ebrahim Sadaqa [20719702]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Diky Mudhakir, S.Si., M.Si., Ph.D.", "Dr. Ratna Annisa Utami, S.Si., M.Si."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Farmasi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Farmasi", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Nanotoxicity, genotoxicity, Phyllanthus niruri, sertoli cell, DNA damage, immunofluorescence, blood-testis barrier (BTB), spermatogenesis", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Jun 2022"}
