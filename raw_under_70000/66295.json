{"Nomor": 66295, "Judul": "PLASMA LEVELS OF INTERLEUKIN-6 AND 18 SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE IN PATIENTS WITH.ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME", "Abstrak": "Atherosclerosis is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease which is the number\none cause of death globally. Atherosclerosis is a chronic and progressive\ninflammatory disease characterized by the buildup of lipids and fibrous plaques in\nthe intima lining of the arterial walls. Inflammatory pathways play a significant\nrole in atherosclerosis that leads to acute coronary syndrome. The initial stages\nof atherosclerosis are often asymptomatic; when atherosclerotic plaque becomes\nunstable it leads to acute coronary syndrome ACS. Therefore, early detection,\ndiagnosis, and treatment of atherosclerosis must be sought. These circumstances\nunderpin the need of diagnostic values of inflammatory markers, warranting their\nroutine clinical application to develop anti-atherosclerotic therapeutic\napproaches. The present aimed to evaluate the plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL6), interleukin-18 (IL-18), interleukin-1?(IL-1?) and interleukin-10 (IL-10). We\nincluded 23 patients diagnosed with ACS with in duration of 48?hours of their\nadmission in hospital and 20 healthy individuals in a case-control observational\nstudy to evaluate the plasma levels of inflammatory biomarkers and their\ncorrelation with each other and with anti-inflammatory interleukin. The mean\nlevels of IL-6 and IL-18 were significantly higher in ACS group when compared\nto the control group; IL-6 = 298.65 pg/ml \u00b1 432.93 pg/ml, p = 0.01; IL-18 =\n181.45pg/ml \u00b1 81.45pg/ml, p <0.004). A correlation analysis showed that there is\na positive correlation exists between each other but there is no correlation exists\nbetween IL-1beta and IL-6, IL-18 and IL-10 with IL-18. The results indicate that\nIL-6 and IL-18 are associated with ACS.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Qurrat Ul Ain": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250872"}, "Penulis": "Qurrat Ul Ain [20720701]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. apt.
