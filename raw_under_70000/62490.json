{"Nomor": 62490, "Judul": "A DUAL-FREQUENCY ACOUSTIC MEASUREMENT METHOD FOR DETECTING FLUID-FILLED CHANNELS AT TWO BOUNDARIES IN CASED HOLES", "Abstrak": "The recognition of fluid-filled channels in cased holes is significant for the safety production of oil and gas wells.\nThe fluid-filled channel at the cement-formation boundary is more difficult to be detected than that at the casingcement\nboundary. To solve the key technical problem, a dual-frequency acoustic measurement method is proposed\nto obtain the cementation state of the two interfaces at the same time. The related theory is that the casing\nwave amplitude from the low-frequency source is sensitive to the channel at both two boundaries, but that from\nthe high-frequency source is only sensitive to the channel at the casing-cement boundary. Therefore, high amplitudes\nof the casing waves from both two sources represent a channel on the casing-cement boundary, high\namplitude from the low-frequency source but low amplitude from the high-frequency source represent a channel\non the cement-formation boundary, and low amplitudes from both two sources represent no channel.\nSubsequently, numerical simulations are performed to examine the effects of several critical parameters on the\ndual-frequency acoustic measurement. The results show that the best combination of the measurement system is\none low-frequency source at 10 kHz together with one high-frequency source at 150 kHz. For the low-frequency\nsource, the casing wave amplitude increases obviously with the increasing channel thickness, regardless of the\nchannel position. The increase of the cement thickness and the casing size damps out the casing wave. For the\nhigh-frequency source, the casing wave amplitude is little affected by these parameters except for the casingcement\nchannel. Moreover, the dual-frequency acoustic measurement method is suitable for common sandstone\nand shale formations. The findings of this study provide a theoretical foundation for next-generation\ncementing-quality-evaluation tool development.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Peng Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hongliang Wu", "Shubo Yang", "Qiqi Zhao", "Jinping Wu", "Xin Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Dual-frequency, Acoustic logging, Fluid-filled channel, Casing wave, Numerical simulation", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 208, Part A,\u00a0January 2022, 109295", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Jan 2022"}
