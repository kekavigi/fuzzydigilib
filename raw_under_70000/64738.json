{"Nomor": 64738, "Judul": "HEAT TREATMENT ON CASSAVA STARCH OF MANIHOT ESCULENTA AND ITS PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTIC", "Abstrak": "Background and objectives:\tCassava (Manihot esculenta) is from the family of\nEuphorbiaceae. Cassava starch obtained from milling the dried tubers. A range of processing techniques are employed to produce cassava starch based food and beverages. The aim of this research is to study the effects of heat treatment on the properties of starch. Methods: The fresh tubers of (Manihot esculenta) are washed, peeled, grinded and extracted using distilled water. The starch sedimentation is then allowed to stand for 24 hours and further dried at room temperatures for 36-48 hours. The modification of starch was then carried out by heating up the powder at different temperatures: (60\u00b0C, 100\u00b0C, 150\u00b0C and 180\u00b0C) for 30 minutes in an oven. The characteristic of the starches were then analysed by determining its viscosity, swelling power, amylose/amylopectin content and morphology of starch granule. Results: Heat treatment at and above 60\u00b0C showed increase in the viscosity. Starch which was heat treated at 100\u00b0C gave the highest viscosity reading. Swelling power decreased as the temperature of heat treatment was increased. The non-modified starch gave the highest swelling power. The amylase content of starch increased as the temperature of heat treatment increased, while the content of amylopectin decreased. The starch granules shrunk when it was heated at and above 60\u00b0C. Conclusion: Heat treatment at and above 60\u00b0C gives difference on the viscosity, swelling power, amylase and amylopectin content and morphology of starch granules.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Kanimolie Periannan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/247819"}, "Penulis": "Kanimolie Periannan [10708721]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Sukrasno, M.S.", "Dr. apt.
