However, its laxative properties have been misinformed to the general public in that it has\nbecome advertised to be a weight loss agent. This misguidance could lead to laxative abuse and present\nvarious consequences due to misuse. This type of behavior is also seen in those with eating disorders i.e.\nbulimia. Therefore, it begs the question whether the use of senna products as a weight loss laxative\nhave a link to that of bulimia. In addition, it is also observed whether the presence of bulimia\nexacerbates other mental health disorders that were already present or activates what was once\ndormant. The systematic review is conducted using the PRISMA method by which evidence was\ngathered and the appropriate content was produced. While no direct correlation could be made, the use\nof laxatives in bulimics is supported, and those with bulimia tend to have co-occurring mental health\ndisorders e.g. anxiety and depression which as a result tend to have the following impact on suicidal\ntendencies.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Tasya Yarfanandi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/260554"}, "Penulis": "Tasya Yarfanandi [11618103]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Kusnandar Anggadiredja, S.Si., M.Si."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Farmasi Klinik dan Komunitas", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Farmasi", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Senna alexandrina, laxative, eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, anxiety, depression, suicidality", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Sep 2022"}
