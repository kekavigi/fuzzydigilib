{"Nomor": 62539, "Judul": "3D CFD SIMULATION OF A HORIZONTAL WELL AT PORE SCALE FOR HEAVY OIL FIELDS", "Abstrak": "Water production in the oil industry has become so common that colloquial expressions such as \u201coil companies no longer\nproduce oil, but water\u201d have been unconsciously accepted in this industry. Nevertheless, water production is a serious\nissue in heavy oil fields with strong aquifers or fields under waterflooding for two reasons: It increases the costs affecting\nthe economic viability of a project, and it has a serious environmental impact due to increasing energy consumption and\nCO2emissions. The root cause behind this problem is a phenomenon called Viscous Fingering, which appears mainly by\nthe viscosity ratio between the phases. This study aims to understand better the Viscous Fingering phenomenon associated\nwith a horizontal well in 3D. For the first time, a scaled horizontal well in a numerical constructed porous media was\nstudied using a full 3D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model. The horizontal well was scaled using the Reynolds\nlaw of similarity from a real section of a horizontal well. While the porous media was made with the DEM physical model\nusing spherical 7mmparticles, which allows reproducing rock properties such as permeability and porosity. This phenomenon\nwas studied at three different scaled production rates, 1000, 1500, and 2000 bbl/d. Finally, three different\noils were considered to study the influence of the viscosity ratio in the CFD modeling of the fingering. It was determined\nthat CFD was capable of simulating Viscous Fingering for horizontal wells at the pore scale. Also, it could give information\nsuch as production and water cut-profiles, location and time of breakthrough, and specific locations of unrecoverable\noil along the reservoir. The information given by the CFD approach could be useful for the development and\nimprovement of completion and enhanced recovery techniques.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Andr\u00e9s Pinilla [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Miguel Asuaje", "Camila Hurtado", "Angela Hoyos", "Luis Ramirez", "Aaron Padr\u00f3n", "Nicol\u00e1s Ratkovich"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Viscous fingering; Pore-scale; Horizontal well; CFD; Heavy oil; Recovery factor", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 196,\u00a0January 2021, 107632, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920410520306999", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Jan 2022"}
