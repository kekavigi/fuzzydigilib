{"Nomor": 66231, "Judul": "OPTIMUM PRODUCTION OPERATING CONDITIONS FOR ARTIFICIAL LIFT ESP - GAS LIFT HYBRID METHOD", "Abstrak": "The application of the ESP - GL hybrid is one way to overcome the limitations of individual artificial lift system, both ESP and gas lift. By using the same ESP system, the production rate can be increased by utilizing the mechanism of gas lift. The gas lift method itself has limitations if there is no adequate gas supply to lift the fluid at optimum rate and if the injection pressure can be applied also has limitations so that it cannot achieve optimum operating conditions.\nOn the other hand, the use of a gas lift can also be a backup if the ESP fails which causes production to stop for some time until the rig is available for workover. The application of this hybrid system has not been widely used in Indonesia, but there are several cases where the application of this hybrid system has proven to be successful, such as in the Xianjin, Balcon, and Tello fields.\nThis study discusses the optimum design of ESP, gas lift, and Hybrid ESP \u2013 GL with limited amount of injection gas availability and injection pressure. Apart from the technical aspect, this study also analyzed the economic aspect of the three artificial lift methods.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Hanif Indra Rajasa": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250764"}, "Penulis": "Hanif Indra Rajasa [12218016]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
