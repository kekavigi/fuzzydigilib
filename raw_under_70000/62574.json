{"Nomor": 62574, "Judul": "MAPPING OF SMALL-SCALE GOLD DEPOSITS USING SENTINEL-2 AND DEMNAS IN CINEAM, TASIKMALAYA, INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "Remote sensing methods have been used to identify large-scale gold deposits by mapping alteration zones and geological structures. Identifying the feasibility of satellite imagery with a medium spatial resolution (about 10 to 30 m) to identify small-scale gold deposits is an interesting challenge. This study aimed to explore the capability of Sentinel-2 and the Digital Elevation Model Nasional (DEMNAS; Indonesian DEM) to map small-scale gold deposits in Cineam, Tasikmalaya, West Java, Indonesia. Cineam gold deposits are known as low-sulfidation\u2013type deposits, and locals have practiced artisanal and small-scale mining activity in the area since the 1970s. Two types of imagery are used in this research: Sentinel-2 imagery for reflectance analysis and DEMNAS imagery for geological structure interpretation. A ground survey was conducted in July 2020 for verification and sampling. The spectral and transform methods were used to identify alteration and lithology information from Sentinel-2 data, and DEMNAS was used to extract the lineaments as the basis for interpreting geological structures. Both types of imagery revealed potential areas for deposits around Cineam, and these areas correspond well to existing spot mining locations. The geological structure analysis also shows that the deposits are controlled by geological structures, with the dominant direction being NW\u2013SE.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Arie Naftali Hawu Hede": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240987", "2020 ARIE NAFTALI HAWU HEDE 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240988", "2020 ARIE NAFTALI HAWU HEDE 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240989", "2020 ARIE NAFTALI HAWU HEDE 1-PAPER.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240990"}, "Penulis": "Arie Naftali Hawu Hede [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Syafrizal, Andy Yahya Al Hakim, Dzaki Fakhri Khairo, and Safira Putri Rahmadica"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Remote sensing, Digital Elevation Model Nasional (DEMNAS), Sentinel-2, Cineam", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Jan 2022"}
