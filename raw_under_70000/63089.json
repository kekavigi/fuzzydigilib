{"Nomor": 63089, "Judul": "PROTOCOL FOR OPTIMAL SIZE SELECTION OF PUNCHED SCREEN IN STEAM ASSISTED GRAVITY DRAINAGE OPERATIONS", "Abstrak": "Punched screen as a stand-alone screen is gaining more and more popularity in Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) operations. However, the literature contains limited studies for proper aperture size selection and the performance of the punched screen. This paper aims at investigating the performance of punched screen and generating an aperture size selection protocol for SAGD production wells.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Chenxi Wang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jesus D.
