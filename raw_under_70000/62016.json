{"Nomor": 62016, "Judul": "DESIGN AND OPTIMIZATION OF LIGHTWEIGHT LITHIUM- ION BATTERY PROTECTOR WITH 3D AUXETIC META STRUCTURES", "Abstrak": "This research study involves the design and optimization of sandwich structure based on auxetic structure to protect the battery system for electric vehicle (EV) undergoing ground impact load. In this study, a pouch battery system is used due to great potential to be the next Li-Ion battery for EV due to its simplicity, higher energy density, and higher space efficiency compared to cylindrical or prismatic battery cells. However, just like the other form of Li-Ion battery, the pouch battery cells have a high fire risk due to the battery deformation.\n\nThe sandwich structure is designed to prevent battery deformation due to ground impact. The core of the sandwich structure is filled with auxetic structure that has gone through optimization to maximize specific energy absorbed (SEA). Its performance is analyzed with non-linear finite element method. Five geometrical variables of the auxetic structures were analyzed using Analysis of Variance and optimized using Taguchi\u2019s method. The optimum control variables are double-U hierarchal (DUH), the\ncross-section\u2019s thickness = 2 ????????????????, the length of the cell = 10 ????????????????, the width of the cell\n= 17 ????????????????, and the bending\u2019s height = 3 ????????????????.\nThe optimized geometries are then arranged into three different sandwich structure\n\nconfigurations. The optimized sandwich structure has optimized DUH cell as the core\n\nthat has been enlarged to 200% in length (single cell\u2019s dimension 38 \u00d7 38 \u00d7 24 ????????????????), arranged in 11 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 1 cells resulting in total dimension and mass of 189 \u00d7 189 \u00d7\n12 ???????????????? and 0.75 ????????????????. The optimized sandwich structure shows that the pouch battery\ncells are able to be protected very well from ground impact load with the maximum\ndeformation of 1.92 ????????????????, which is below the deformation threshold for battery failure.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Michael Alfred Stephenson Biharta ": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/237526"}, "Penulis": "Michael Alfred Stephenson Biharta  [13617073]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
