{"Nomor": 62521, "Judul": "RISK ANALYSIS OF NATURAL HYDRAULIC FRACTURING IN AN OVERPRESSURED BASIN WITH MUD DIAPIRS: A CASE STUDY FROM THE YINGGEHAI BASIN, SOUTH CHINA SEA", "Abstrak": "The Yinggehai Basin is a strongly overpressured basin without large-scale faults in the Central Depression Zone.\nThe hydraulic seal capacity of the caprocks over geological history has been the key factor controlling the vertical\ndistribution characteristics of oil and gas. Based on leak-off data, rock mechanics tests and measured pore\npressure data, this paper analyses the potential of natural hydraulic fracturing with the fault analysis seal\ntechnology (FAST) methodology for caprocks C1 (caprock of the Huangliu Formation) and C2 (caprock of the\nMeishan Formation) of the diapir belt in the north Central Depression Zone and determines the failure mode and\ngas sealing capacity of the two caprocks. The results show that gas leakage occurred continuously in both C1 and\nC2 in the diapir zone (DZ) throughout geological time. However, far from the diapir zone (FDZ), hydraulic\nleakage occurred only in caprock C2 while no leakage occurred in caprock C1 over geological time. These results\nare consistent with the gas accumulation that occurred in both the Yinggehai Formation and Huangliu Formation\nin the DZ but only in the Huangliu Formation in the FDZ. A relatively reasonable explanation is that diapirism\npromoted natural hydraulic fracture development via the following effects: (i) Diapirism transfers deep overpressure\nto shallow layers and increases the pressure gradient; (ii) The high-angle fractures associated with\ndiapirism reduce the critical stress condition for the occurrence of natural hydraulic fracturing; and (iii) Diapirism\nresults in the formation of dome structures in shallow layers, causing more shallow burial of caprock in\nthe DZ than the FDZ. Shallowly buried caprocks, which have a relatively lower hydraulic fracture pressure,\nfacilitate gas migration. These effects promoted natural hydraulic fracturing in the DZ, which is the main reason\nfor the difference in the vertical distribution of gas reservoirs between the DZ and FDZ.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Yejun Jin [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Caiwei Fan", "Xiaofei Fu", "Lingdong Meng", "Bo Liu", "Ru Jia", "Sijia Cao", "Ruishan Du", "Hu Li", "Jiancai Tan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Yinggehai basin; Overpressure; Caprock; Natural hydraulic fracturing; Leakage potential; Mud diapir", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 196,\u00a0January 2021, 107621", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Jan 2022"}
