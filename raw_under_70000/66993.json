In international\npractice, one of the answers to this problem is the Construction of Third-Party\nLogistics (TPL) \u2013 an external organization that performs all or part of a company\u2019s\nlogistics functions. Considering the characteristics of Indonesia\u2019s construction\nsupply chain, TPL service cannot be simply duplicated and utilized, as doing so\nmay cause more harm than good. This research aims to shed light on the risks that\nneed to be borne in establishing a Construction TPL service in Indonesia.\nA probabilistic risk analysis approach to construction logistic operations is\nproposed. Based on the hierarchical simulation model, risk factors can be analyzed\nat the operation level of logistic operations. Moreover, the Bayesian network is\nembedded into the simulation program to quantitatively calculate the probability of\nrisk events in each simulation cycle, considering geographical restriction, planning\nrisk, information-sharing, and management quality and their mutual dependence.\nThrough running the simulation, contingency resources (time and budget) are\ndetermined and may provide a certain level of confidence for TPL providers to\nexecute their logistics services successfully. Moreover, a comparative analysis\nbetween the two alternatives of TPL arrangement (terminal-based arrangement and\ncheckpoint-based arrangement) shows that terminal-based arrangement has a\nhigher resistance toward logistic risks.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Patrick Gabriel Heuw": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/253900"}, "Penulis": "Patrick Gabriel Heuw [15018088]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
