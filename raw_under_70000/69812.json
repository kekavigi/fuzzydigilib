{"Nomor": 69812, "Judul": "SYSTEM ENGINEERING ENHANCES PHOTOELECTROCHEMICAL CO2 REDUCTION", "Abstrak": "The photoelectrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (PEC-CO2RR)\nallows us to convert solar power to chemical energy with photosensitive materials.\nSemiconductor-based, plasmon-assisted, and dye-sensitized systems have been extensively\ninvestigated in the PEC-CO2RR. Beyond the remarkable progress in materials science, it is\nexpected to realize new systems for satisfying the needs of both research discoveries and\nindustry applications. In this Perspective, we summarize the latest progress in the field of the\nPEC-CO2RR, focusing on enhancing efficiencies via matching photoelectron flux, charge\ntransfer rate, and mass transport rate. Based on the principles for the state-of-the-art PECCO2RR,\nnew designs of the system engineering strategies on photoelectrode fabrication,\nreactor design, electrolyte optimization, and membrane selection are proposed to enhance\nselectivity and stability of the PEC-CO2RR.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Miao Kan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Qihao Wang, Shuya Hao, Anxiang Guan, Yangshen Chen, Quan Zhang, Qing Han, and Gengfeng Zheng"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Nov 2022"}
