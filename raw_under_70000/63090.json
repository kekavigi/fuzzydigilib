{"Nomor": 63090, "Judul": "MODELING SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF 2D ANISOTROPIC HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY TENSOR OF FRACTURED GROUNDWATER FLOW MEDIA USING NEURAL NETWORK CASE STUDY GRASBERG OPEN PIT OF PTFI AND SURROUNDING", "Abstrak": "Highly fractured rocks in Grasberg open pit and surrounding of PT Freeport Indonesia (PTFI) result in fractured groundwater flow media. It is due to the complex geological structure and lithological condition. Accordingly, it leads to anisotropic distribution of hydraulic conductivity. The paper will be devoted\ntothe modeling of two dimensional (2D) spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity using neural network. Surface fracture mapping database will be used to estimate 2D equivalent anisotropic hydraulic conductivity tensor based on the Oda et al (1996) approach. Modeled anisotropic hydraulic conductivity is then checked at some points where the slug tests for isotropic conductivity are observed. Co-relation, validation and training between modeled and observed hydraulic conductivity is then carried out using transformation of vector anisotropic hydraulic conductivity into the scalar isotropic hydraulic conductivity. Following training step, neural network will then generate two dimensional model of anisotropic hydraulic\nconductivity distribution. It is beneficial for modeling of shallow anisotropic flow of groundwater distribution.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Adam Verdyansyah Putra": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242075", "2015 ADAM VERDYANSYAH PUTRA 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242076", "2015 ADAM VERDYANSYAH PUTRA 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242077", "2015 ADAM VERDYANSYAH PUTRA 1-PAPER.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242079"}, "Penulis": "Adam Verdyansyah Putra [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Tedy Agung Cahyadi, Lilik Eko Widodo, and Eman Widijanto"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "hydraulic conductivity tensor, modeling two dimensional distribution, neural network (NN), Oda method", "Sumber": "https://osf.io/preprints/inarxiv/dh7tj/", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Jan 2022"}
