{"Nomor": 66244, "Judul": "OPTIMIZATION OF PIPELINE DESIGN IN 2-PHASE GEOTHERMAL FIELD TO AVOID SLUG FLOW OCCURRENCE", "Abstrak": "The water-dominated geothermal field produces 2-phase fluid where there is steam and water flowing, in this 2-phase fluid flow there is a flow pattern that can cause problems in surface facilities such as slug flow. This study aims to determine the operating pressure conditions of a geothermal field to avoid slug flow.\nIn this study, the pressure drop during flow and also the velocity are calculated to determine the flow pattern. The pressure drop calculation method uses homogeneous equations which are often used in geothermal, this method is the simplest calculation method and produces reasonable settlement estimates. Due to the presence of insulation, this study does not take into account the effect of heat loss on pressure drop.\nThis study discusses the \u201cX\u201d geothermal field which has a total of 7 wells. These wells are divided into several plots of wells with different production curves. The results of this study produce an analysis of the occurrence of slug flow patterns and the effect of installing a separator to prevent slug flow.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Maulana Fatwa Putra": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250784"}, "Penulis": "Maulana Fatwa Putra [12218012]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dimas Taha Maulana, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "pipeline, 2-phase flow, pressure drop, slug flow", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Jun 2022"}
