{"Nomor": 64270, "Judul": "NEW CORRELATION TO PREDICT FUTURE SINGLE-PHASE IPR FOR HORIZONTAL WELL BY CONSIDERING FRICTIONAL-PRESSURE-DROP", "Abstrak": "Advanced in drilling technology have focused oil industry\u2019s attention on importance of horizontal-well, because it gives more advantages. So that many horizontal-wells have been drilled around the world.9 High improvements in drilling allow wells thousands of feet long. However, friction can possibly limit useful length of horizontal-well. In cases long wells or high rate, pressure drop need to be considered. Ignoring friction could lead to unrealistically higher IPR.7 Commonly, IPR is generated by neglecting friction.11 Therefore, horizontal-well IPR must be calculated by considering friction. First, this study is conducted with analytical model (single-phase flow and homogenous reservoir). Resulted frictional-IPR has non-linear relationship. From sensitivity analysis, new-dimensionless IPR is introduced by making a regression to all of the sensitivity result that has been plot in one graph. To know the potential impact of uncertain input variables on IPR result outcomes, spider diagrams evaluation in then investigated. From this study, we will know the variable with the greatest potential impact to our IPR correlation result. There are 6 parameters that highly influence IPR. After that, IPR correlation is validated with numerical model (homogenous and heterogeneous). And because of the changing reservoir condition during the time of production, then IPR will changes too. Predicting future IPR is frequently needed in most oil fields. Finally, in this study, will be introduced the future IPR correlation for one-phase Horizontal well with considering the frictional pressure drop with the ways to derive it.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Singgih Suganda [12208031]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Pudjo Sukarno, M.
