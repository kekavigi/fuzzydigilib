{"Nomor": 64792, "Judul": "ISOLATION OF FLAVONOID FROM ETHYL ACETATE EXTRACT OF WOODFORDIA FLORIBUNDA SALISB. FLOWER", "Abstrak": "Woodfordia floribunda Salisb or locally known as sidawayah is a medicinal plant that can be found in tropical forest of Indonesia. It is used as a traditional medicine and contained many compounds such as triterpenoids, saponins, tannins, flavonoids, quinone and steroids/triterpenoid. It has activity such as antioxidant,hcpatoprotective, and antibacterial. The purpose of this research was to isolate flavonoid from Woodfordia floribunda Salisb. flower. The crude drug was extracted with rcflux method using two different solvents which were n-hexane and ethyl acetate and they were monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC). The ethyl acetate extracts were then further fractionated, using vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) and monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC) under UV light 254 nm and 366 nm. Preparative TLC was used for purification. The purity test was done using 3 single developments. The isolated compound was identified and characterized by UV-Visible spectrophotometry. Phytochemical screening showed positive results for tannin, saponin, flavonoid, quinine, steroid/ tritcrpcnoid test. Yield values of n-hexane and ethyl acetate extract were 1.51% and 2.36%. Ethyl acetate extract was chosen for further fractionation using VLC, where 21 fractions were obtained. Fraction no 8 was chosen and purified using preparative TLC and band X was obtained. It was scrapped and its purity test was done by three different solvent systems which showed single spot. Based on the identification using citroboric reagent it showed blue color under 366 nm. UV spectrophotometry showed a maximum wavelength at 254 nm and 334 nm and 2 dimension paper chromatography showed that the isolate belongs to flavones aglycone or flavonol aglycone or flavonol with substituted 3-OH.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Krisna Veni A P Karruppanan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/248118"}, "Penulis": "Krisna Veni A P Karruppanan [10710768]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Asep Gana Suganda", "M.Insanu, M.Si."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sains dan Teknologi Farmasi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Farmasi", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Jun 2022"}
