Family Annonaceae have known because of their antibacterial activity. Some of them are soursop (Annona muricata), Annona squamosa, Stelechocarpus burahol, Cananga odorata, and Annona reticulata. The aim of this study is to evaluate in vitro antibacterial activity of leaves ethanolic extract of five plants by determining Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), Minimal Bactericidal Concentration (MBC), antibiotic activity equivalency, and time-kill curve from extract with the best antibacterial activity to tested bacteria. The crude drug of five plants were extracted by reflux using redistillated 96% ethanol as solvent. Antibacterial activity of concentrated extracts was tested using Broth microdilution method to determine MIC against Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Bacillus suhtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Of the five plants tested, one that showed the best antibacterial activity against one or more species bacteria was chosen. It means that the extract with the lowest value of MIC. The extract then also tested to determine MBC, antibiotic activity equivalency, and time-kill curve. Screening antibacterial activity using Broth microdilution method showed that leaves ethanolic extract of Stelechocarpus burahol possessed the best antibacterial activity against B.subtilis, MSSA, and MRSA with MIC 512, 512, and 1024 ppm respectively. But, the extract showed no antibacterial activity against E.coli, Kpneumoniae, and P.aeruginosa up to concentration 4096 ppm using Broth microdilution method. The MBC of extract was 2048 ppm for B.subtilis and MSSA, and 4096 ppm for MRSA. Equivalency of antibacterial activity of extract to standard antibiotic showed that 1 mg of extract had equivalency activity to 1,67x104 mg, 1,62x10-3 mg, 1,73x10-3 mg of tetracycline HC1 for B.subtilis, MSSA, MRSA, and 1,13x10-4 mg, 3,99x10-6 mg, and 7,13x106 mg ciprofloxacin HC1 for Ecoli, K pneumoniae, dan P.aeruginosa. Antibacterial activity equivalency of extract to standard antibiotic was the highest against MRSA (1 mg \u2014 1,73 x 10-3 mg tetracycline HCl). The result of time-kill curve test displayed bacteriostatic profile against B.subtilis at concentration 1 MIC (512 ppm) and 4 MIC (2048 ppm).", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Annisa Kamil": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/247009"}, "Penulis": "Annisa Kamil [10709067]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Elin Yulinah", "Prof. Dr. Irda Fidrianny, M.Si."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sains dan Teknologi Farmasi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Farmasi", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Mei 2022"}
