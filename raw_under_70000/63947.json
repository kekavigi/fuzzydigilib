The data used in this study were sourced from the publications of the Agency for the Improvement of the Implementation of the Drinking Water Supply System (BPPSPAM) and the Central Statistics Agency (BPS). A total of 231 PDAMs during the 2014-2019 period became the object of study in this study. In achieving the sixth SDGs target, access to clean water is the main target in achieving this target. PDAM (Regional Drinking Water Company) as a BUMD that provides SPAM (Drinking Water Supply System) services in the regions has an important role in achieving the national clean water access target. This study examines the factors that influence the achievement of access to clean water which is termed the number of PDAM's House Connections (SR). The study uses panel data regression analysis to obtain an overview of what factors most significantly affect the increase in the number of PDAM SRs. Furthermore, in 2016 there was a government policy that wrote off PDAM debt with a total value of Rp3.86 trillion. The impact of this policy was analyzed using the Difference in Differences (DID) method. The results of the regression analysis show that the variable of demand aspect that has a significant and positive effect on the PDAM's SR is GDP per capita. Meanwhile, the supply aspect variables are the number of employees and assets (for PDAMs outside Java). While the DID analysis resulted in an ATE value of 0.0129 and the DID regression results showed that the impact of the policy had no significant effect on increasing PDAM SR.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Iyan Ardiyan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/245103", "BAB_1 Iyan Ardiyan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/245104", "BAB_2 Iyan Ardiyan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/245105", "BAB_3 Iyan Ardiyan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/245106", "BAB_4 Iyan Ardiyan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/245107", "BAB_5 Iyan Ardiyan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/245108", "BAB_6 Iyan Ardiyan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/245109", "DAFTAR Iyan Ardiyan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/245110", "2022_TS_PP_IYAN_ARDIYAN_LAMPIRAN.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/245111"}, "Penulis": "Iyan Ardiyan [24020014]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Adiwan Fahlan Aritenang, S.T., M.GIT., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Studi Pembangunan", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Arsitektur, Perencanaan dan Pengembangan Kebijakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "SR, PDAM, Penghapusan Utang, DID", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "sarnya", "File": "9 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Mar 2022"}
