{"Nomor": 66228, "Judul": "PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF ZIRCONIA SCREEN IN SHALLOW GAS WELL : A CASE STUDY IN WELL T2", "Abstrak": "\u201cM\u201d Block is one of the biggest mature block (has been production for 40 years) in Indonesia located in Province of East Kalimantan with total areas around 3,266.44 km2 . \u201cM\u201d Block divide into seven fields consist of three swamp fields, namely \u201cT\u201d, \u201cTA\u201d, \u201cH, and four offshore fields including \u201cP\u201d, \u201cSN\u201d, \u201cB\u201d, and \u201cSM\u201dfields. Most of swamp fields are producing gas with well depth of up to 13000 ft, while most of offshore fields are oil producer.\n\u201cM\u201d Block is formed as deltaic plain that are deposited by slow energy river flow such that type of most compaction grain are unconsolidated. Reservoir depth in \u201cM\u201d Block is also shallow, it makes sand easy to raised up to the surface due to gas or oil production. This phenomena can cause many problem including eroded tubing, plugging as a result of the accumulation of sand in the bottom hole, inefficient flow rate, and ultimately may damage surface facilities. Petroleum engineer create various sand control to be solution due to indication of sand problem in a well. One type of sand control is stand alone screen which leverage mechanical principal.\nEconomic considerations are one of the concerns of every company, especially now in the post-oil peak era. This makes a company to find innovations in order to cut expenditure, including the innovation of stand alone screen type. Service company X used Thru Tubing Ceramic Screen (TTCS) as an innovation of mechanical sand control which is currently popular and replace the premium screen that easy to erode. However, when compared to premium screen, cost of tools and installation from TTCS is more expensive and there are still problems with erosion due to high velocity.\nZirconia Screen is the newest innovation to be compared with TTCS. This screen is a wire wrapped type of screen with materials relatively more robust and cheaper than ceramic screen. Zirconia Screen have a good compressive strength until 5690 Mpa and good flexural strength up to 1250 Mpa, more strength than silicon carbide (TTCS material). Zirconia Screen trial installed in 4 well in \u201cT\u201d Field and the result is satisfying with 100% success ratio. The selected well (T2), which is the tubing-less completion with setting depth of 4823 ft TVD and 250 micron slot opening of Zirconia Screen, have AOFP of 4.143 MSCFD optimum production rate within 1.24 \u2013 2.89 MMSCFD, and skin value of 19.34.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Gading Arganu Pradipta": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250754"}, "Penulis": "Gading Arganu Pradipta [12218029]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Amega Yasutra, S.T., M.T.", "Ardhi Hakim Lumban Gaol, S.T., M.T., M.Si., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "\u201cM\u201d Block, Ceramic Screen, Zirconia Screen, Well T2, optimum production, skin", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Jun 2022"}
