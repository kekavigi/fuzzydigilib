{"Nomor": 63347, "Judul": "TRANSPARENT OPEN-BOX LEARNING NETWORK AND ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK PREDICTIONS OF BUBBLE-POINT PRESSURE COMPARED", "Abstrak": "The transparent open box (TOB) learning network algorithm offers an alternative approach to the lack of transparency provided by most machine-learning algorithms. It provides the exact calculations and relationships among the underlying input variables of the datasets to which it is applied. It also has the capability to achieve credible and auditable levels of prediction accuracy to complex, non-linear datasets, typical of those encountered in the oil and gas sector, highlighting the potential for underfitting and overfitting. The algorithm is applied here to predict bubble-point pressure from a published PVT dataset of 166 data records involving four easy-to-measure variables (reservoir temperature, gas-oil ratio, oil gravity, gas density relative to air) with uneven, and in parts, sparse data coverage. The TOB network demonstrates high-prediction accuracy for this complex system, although it predictions applied to the full dataset are outperformed by an artificial neural network (ANN). However, the performance of the TOB algorithm reveals the risk of overfitting in the sparse areas of the dataset and achieves a prediction performance that matches the ANN algorithm where the underlying data population is adequate. The high levels of transparency and its inhibitions to overfitting enable the TOB learning network to provide complementary information about the underlying dataset to that provided by traditional machine learning algorithms. This makes them suitable for application in parallel with neural-network algorithms, to overcome their black-box tendencies, and for benchmarking the prediction performance of other machine learning algorithms.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "David A.
