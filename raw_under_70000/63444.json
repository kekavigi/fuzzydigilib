Aiming at this concern, this paper introduces a novel characterization method for the emulsification of a surfactant-oil system induced by ultrasonic vibration. This method quantitatively evaluates the emulsification capability of chemical flooding agents using a parameter called emulsification index (EI), which fully characteristics the emulsification speed and amount. This method was applied to a set of oil displacement experiments and the results support the notion that emulsification index is a reasonable parameter for characterization of the emulsification capability of chemical flooding agents.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Ya-bing Guo [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiang-an Yue", "Chang-chun Yang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Enhanced oil recovery; Chemical flooding; Emulsification capability; Emulsification index", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 196, 2021, 107810, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920410520308718", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Feb 2022"}
