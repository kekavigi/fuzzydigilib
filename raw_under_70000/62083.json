{"Nomor": 62083, "Judul": "MINERALIZATION STUDY OF CIURUG VEIN FOR UNDER LEVEL 500 M IN PONGKOR MINE, WEST JAVA,  INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "Pongkor is one of epithermal low sulphidation mineralization which located in Leuwiliang, Bogor, and West Java. Based on previous researches, it has known that there is a possibility of existence of transition zone between precious metal and base metal horizon. Analyzing mineralization of samples from mine tunnel level 600 masl and level 515 masL of Ciurug Vein is to identify this transition level. Mineragraphy analysis is also done for core samples which are from level under 500 masl. Mineralogy observation of core and chip samples is to identify mineralization variation. Mineral identification of tunnel samples and core samples show existence of pyrite, chalcopyrite, galena, Sphalerite, and tetrahedrite. From fluid inclusion, temperature of condition forming is increasing to lower level that proven in core sample analysis. The salinity which is around (0.1 - 0.4) wt% NaCI eq is same as previous research.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Syafrizal": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/238575", "2011 MINERALIZATION STUDY OF CIURUG VEIN FOR UNDER LEVEL 500 M 1-PAPER.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/238576"}, "Penulis": "Syafrizal [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Teti Indriati, M.
