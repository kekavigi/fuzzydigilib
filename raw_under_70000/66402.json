{"Nomor": 66402, "Judul": "COOLING IDENTIFICATION AT WELL \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdX\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd IN THE WAYANG WINDU FIELD, WEST JAVA, INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "Cooling often occurs in geothermal wells, especially after exploitation for quite several years, including in the Wayang Windu geothermal field. This cooling problem can lead to a reduction in production leading to a shortage of power plants to generate electricity. Identifying and analyzing the root cause of the problems that occur in geothermal wells is important to know the right preventive action plan. Analyzing the behavior of geothermal wells requires an understanding of what parameters can affect the phenomena that occurs.\nThis study aims to identify the occurrence of cooling in well \u201cX\u201d. The identification process is carried out by analyzing field data such as PT shut-in data, geochemical data, and daily production data. Data analysis is not only done by looking at each data, but there must be a relationship between these data that causes this well to cool down. After this well is identified to have cooling problem, a minimum temperature analysis that can be carried out by this well to be able to produce up to the production pipeline at pressure conditions at the production facility is required. This calculation process uses an In-house simulator with parameters that match the results of the previous cooling analysis.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Prameswari Dyah Galuh C.K.": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/251044"}, "Penulis": "Prameswari Dyah Galuh C.K.
