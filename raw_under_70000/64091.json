{"Nomor": 64091, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT OF SATURATION HEIGHT FUNCTIONS BASED ON ROCK TYPING FOR AN INDONESIAN OFFSHORE FIELD", "Abstrak": "Determining saturation-height function is very important in reservoir characterization since it has great impacts in fluids saturation distribution profile above free water level (FWL). The urge to develop saturation height function is because each field has unique characteristics of saturation profile.\nThere are some purposes in generating saturation height function such as calculation of OOIP (Original Oil in Place) more accurately, determination of water saturation profile against height on vertical and areal extents, and as the input to reservoir simulation for reservoir performance prediction. Accurate estimation of OOIP and saturation profile also affects reserve calculation, and further field development plan. In conventional way, saturation profile determination in the reservoir is obtained directly using core analysis.\nPrior to saturation height function modeling, rock typing will be demonstrated using J-Function and verified by PGS plot. This paper evaluates and compares the widely known saturation-height method for each rock type based on capilary pressure curve (i.e, Leverett-J, Brooks-Corey, and Lambda) and validated with the available data. The method that yields the least error will be selected as saturation function for the certain rock type. It is also shown in this paper that the correlation of SHF parameters (Pe, Swirr, and Lamda) enhance the accuracy of water saturation profile prediction.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Muzaki Maulana Taufik": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/245368"}, "Penulis": "Muzaki Maulana Taufik [12209039]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
