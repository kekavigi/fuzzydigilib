AND ITS COMBINATION WITH TETRACYCLINE HYDROCHLORIDE AGAINST GRAM-NEGATIVE AND GRAM-POSITIVE BACTERIA", "Abstrak": "Background and purpose: The use of herbs and spices as therapeutic agent against many\npathological infection and its interaction when combining with medication has not been fully\nexploited. This study was carried out to investigate the antibacterial activity of ethanolic extracts from\nthe peels of Punica granatum L., rhizomes of Zingiber officinale Roscoe and leaves of Elephantopus\nscaber L. and combination of these extract against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and\nStaphylococcus aureus. Besides that, this study was also aimed at determining the interaction between\neach extracts with tetracycline HCl against P. aeruginosa, E. coli and S. aureus. Method: The\nantimicrobial potency of ethanolic extracts from the peels of P. granatum L., rhizomes of Z. officinale\nRoscoe and leaves of E. scaber L. was tested through the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC)\nand Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) by using microdilution well method. The interaction\nbetween combination of extracts, and between extract and antibiotic were tested through Fraction\nInhibitory Concentration Index (FICI) by checkerboard method. Result: Based on phytochemical\nscreening result, crude drug and ethanolic extract of P. granatum peels contained alkaloid, flavonoid\nand tannin. The crude drug and ethanolic extract of Z. officinale rhizome contained\nsteroid/triterpenoid, flavonoid, and tannin. Meanwhile, the crude drug and ethanolic extract of E.\nscaber leaves contain flavonoid and steroid/triterpenoid. The MIC of ethanolic extract of P. granatum\npeels against P. aeruginosa, E. coli and S. aureus were 16 \u00b5g/mL, 256\u00b5g/mL and 64\u00b5g/mL,\nrespectively. The MIC of ethanolic extract of Z. officinale against P. aeruginosa, E. coli and S. aureus\nwere 2000\u00b5g/mL, 2000\u00b5g/mL and 8000\u00b5g/mL, respectively. Meanwhile, The MIC of ethanolic\nextract of E. scaber against P. aeruginosa, E. coli and S. aureus were 8000\u00b5g/mL, 256\u00b5g/mL and\n8000\u00b5g/mL, respectively. The MIC of tetracycline HCl against P. aeruginosa, E. coli and S. aureus\nwere 2\u00b5g/ml, 16\u00b5g/mL and 2\u00b5g/mL, respectively. The FICI value for combination between P.\ngranatum peels and Z. officinale against P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. aureus were 0.625, 1.062, and\n0.563, respectively. Meanwhile, the FICI of extract between P. granatum peels and E. scaber against\nP. aeruginosa, E. coli and S. aureus were 0.188, 1.250 and 0.3750, respectively. Then, in next\nevaluation of combination of extract of tetracycline HCl with P. granatum gave FICI value 0.531 and\n0.250 against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus respectively. The combination of tetracycline HCl with Z.\nofficinale gave FICI value 0.281 for both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. Lastly the combination of\ntetracycline HCl with E. scaber gave FICI value 0.375 and 0.531 against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus,\nrespectively. Conclusion: Extract of Punica granatum peels has the lowest MIC compared to extract\nof Elephantopus scaber leaves and extract of Zingiber officinale rhizomes against P. aeruginosa, E.\ncoli and S. aureus. Combination between peels of Punica granatum extract with leaves of\nElephantopus scaber extract gives the lowest FICI value, suggesting the highest synergistic effect\namong extracts combination. Furthermore, combination of tetracycline HCl with each extracts tested\ngives synergistic effect against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Azreen Natasha": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/239693"}, "Penulis": "Azreen Natasha [10711704]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. apt.
