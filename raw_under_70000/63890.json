Website building, SEO, copywriting, social media management, and digital paid advertising are all part of the service. The agency's demand has continued to increase in development, but it cannot service them. As a result, they were overwhelmed by the enormous volume of work that had already been offered to them.\n\nProjects are being rejected because the agency's infrastructure, such as its operating system and employees, cannot accommodate them. The team felt that if this situation persisted, it would be detrimental to the firm. This will limit the agency's growth. The organizational gap between the required infrastructure and the organization caused some growing pains for the agency.\n\nAs the company expands, it will need to transform. The Startup Way is a valuable tool for business management in an age of innovation. An organizational process development flow sums up the most critical steps needed in a small business setting. The implementation is formulated by designing the organization, developing management systems, and maintaining an entrepreneurial culture.\n\nThe findings indicate that an internal startup team can be launched in a non-startup context, presenting particular concerns. They are mainly related to people and organizational challenges. Based on organizational infrastructure, there are enablers and inhibitors of applying the startup way approach in a low-tech company. Personnel hiring, performance, and organizational culture are the enablers. Conversely, the inhibitors are resource management, technology, and operating systems.\n\nThis study makes a couple of research contributions. Firstly, this study examines the application of the Startup Way approach in a small business setting. Secondly, the study indicates the organizational framework's applicability. Future research could expand on our findings by examining its limitations.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Jessica Krisheila Martua": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/253834", "BAB 1 Jessica Krisheila Martua": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/253835", "BAB 2 Jessica Krisheila Martua": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/253836", "BAB 3 Jessica Krisheila Martua": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/253837", "BAB 4 Jessica Krisheila Martua": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/253838", "PUSTAKA Jessica Krisheila Martua": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/253839"}, "Penulis": "Jessica Krisheila Martua [29320001]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Wawan Dhewanto, S.T., M.Sc., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Administrasi Bisnis", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Startup Way, Manajemen Pertumbuhan, UMKM", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Roosalina Vanina Viyazza", "File": "6 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Mar 2022"}
