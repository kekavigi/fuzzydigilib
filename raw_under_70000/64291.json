{"Nomor": 64291, "Judul": "FORMULATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF A MULTIPLE EMULSION CONTAINING ASCORBIC ACID", "Abstrak": "Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is an antioxidant which protects skin from the sun and neutralizes free radicals. It effectively promotes collagen production which tones and tightens the skin to help repair the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It has also been proven to reduce skin discoloration due to sun damage, aging, and acne scarring. Ascorbic acid is very unstable and can easily oxidize; making the compound ineffective. The purpose of the study was to prepare a stable multiple emulsions containing ascorbic acid using liquid paraffin as oil phase. Ascorbic acid, was incorporated into the inner aqueous phases of water-in-oil-in-water (wlolw) multiple emulsions. Multiple emulsions were prepared by two step method that involves re-emulsification of primary W/O emulsion using a suitable emulsifier agent. The first step is preparing an ordinary W/O primary emulsion wherein an appropriate of Span 80 as emulsifying agent is utilized. Then, the freshly prepared W/O primary emulsion is re-emulsified with an excess of aqueous phase using Tween 80 as emulsifying agent. The finally prepared emulsion is W/O/W. Stability studies were performed at different conditions, i.e. room temperature and 40 \u00b0C and 75% RH in climatic chamber for 28 days to predict the stability of formulations. The freeze thaw method was also done to determine the physical stability of the emulsion. Different parameters, namely pH, viscosity, and effect of centrifugation were determined during stability studies. Ascorbic acid content in the multiple emulsions is also determined. Drug release from ascorbic acid multiple emulsions is done to prove that multiple emulsions also is capable of controlling the rate of drug delivery. Multiple emulsions formulated were found to be physically stable at room temperatures for 28 days but there is a various alteration obtained in all the parameters like organoleptic characteristic, pH and viscosity for the multiple emulsion that was kept in 40\u00b0C at 75 RH%. The multiple emulsions are capable of controlling the rate of drug delivery as the release of the drug at 12 hours is only 56%.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Devika Darshini Govindev": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246316"}, "Penulis": "Devika Darshini Govindev [10708710]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Yeyet Cahyati Soemirtapura", "Prof. Dr. Jessie Sofia Pamudji, M.S."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sains dan Teknologi Farmasi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Farmasi", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Mei 2022"}
