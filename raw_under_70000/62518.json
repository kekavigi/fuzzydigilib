{"Nomor": 62518, "Judul": "HEAVY OIL IN-SITU UPGRADING EVALUATION BY A LABORATORY-CALIBRATED EOS-BASED RESERVOIR SIMULATOR", "Abstrak": "A laboratory-calibrated numerical model was designed and computationally accelerated that allows for evaluating the performance of the in-situ upgrading technology\napplied to heavy oil reservoirs during steamflooding operations. The kinetic model, based on SARA measurements, represents aquathermolysis reactions and\nthe thermodynamic oil behavior. Mass and energy transport equations were coupled to a rigorous three-phase equation of state, including the nanoparticle transport\nand retention by non-equilibrium equations. The coupling was validated employing available information such as PVT data before upgrading, the evolution of\ncomposition during a batch-reactor test, and residual oil saturation reduction by nanocatalyst retention. This approach allows for reproducing the API gravity\nenhancement and the oil viscosity reduction during a steamflooding experiment under the presence of a metallic-composed nanocatalyst. Considering uncertainty\nupon retention and wettability alteration, laboratory parameters were up-scaled to simulate steam and nanocatalyst co-injection in an analogous model based on a\nheavy oil reservoir located in the Magdalena Medio Valley Colombian basin. Simulations predict that the oil recovery factor can be increased up to 5% more than\ntypical steamflooding and sets a precedent for the upscaling of this type of technology for pilot test designing. . The laboratory-based numerical model presented in\nthis work suggests that the kinetic scheme based on SARA measurements along with residual oil saturation reduction by non-equilibrium nanoparticle retention\ncaptures the main mechanisms occurring during in-situ upgrading.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Nicol\u00e1s Bueno [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Juan M.
