{"Nomor": 62538, "Judul": "ON THE MECHANISM OF THERMALLY INDUCED MICRO-CRACKING ASSISTED ROCK CUTTING IN HARD FORMATION", "Abstrak": "Low rate of penetration (ROP) and high drilling costs are the severe problems encountered in hard formation\ndrilling, which heavily limit the efficient exploitation of oil and gas resources. In present study, a rock cutting\nmodel of granite using PFC2D-GBM, which considers the confining pressure, hydrostatic pressure, temperature,\ninter-grain and intra-grain contact failures, rock heterogeneities, is carried out to explore the mechanism of\nthermally induced cracking assisted rock cutting in hard formation. The research results show that, with the\ntemperature increasing, the micro-cracks, mainly the inter-grain cracks, will be induced in intact rock due to the\nunequal expansion of grains. The thermally induced crack number increases linearly with increasing the treated\ntemperature until a certain temperature, then it increases sharply deviating from the linear relationship, at last it\nalmost keeps a constant due to the rock fully lose its strength. The cutting force decreases with increasing treated\ntemperature, with exception of 200 ?C without considering hydrostatic pressure and 300 ?C with considering\nhydrostatic pressure. The effects of treated temperature and hydrostatic pressure on cutting force are more\nobviously than the confining pressure. This study leads to an enhanced understanding of thermally induced\ncracking assisted rock cutting mechanisms in hard formation, and provides the basis for developing the thermally\ninduced cracking assisted rock cutting machines.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Weiji Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiaohua Zhu", "YanXin Lv", "Hua Tong"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Rock cutting; Deep and geothermal formation; High temperature; High confining pressure; Heterogeneous", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 196,\u00a0January 2021, 107666, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920410520307336", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Jan 2022"}
