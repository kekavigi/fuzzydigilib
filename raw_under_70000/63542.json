{"Nomor": 63542, "Judul": "A SEMI-EMPIRICAL MODEL FOR CO2 EROSION-CORROSION OF CARBON STEEL PIPELINES IN WET GAS-SOLID FLOW", "Abstrak": "The research of CO2 erosion-corrosion (E-C) of carbon steel pipelines in wet gas-solid flow, as a critical consideration for oil and gas engineering applications, is increasingly receiving more and more interest and attention. A semi-empirical model for the prediction and risk assessment of the conjoint CO2 E-C rate in such conditions is proposed. The variation of fluid properties with system environment is considered during gas-solid flow. The Eulerian-Lagrangian method is employed to solve the N\u2013S equation for computational domain flow field and the force balance equation for migration trajectory of solid particles in the simulation space, and the fluid-solid interaction is considered. An empirical CO2 corrosion model as well as its modified form is provided and verified and an erosion wear model is also adopted, which are both suitable for carbon steel. In addition, the synergistic effect of both models is considered. Based on the above contents, the CFD-DPM technology with test data is adopted to obtain the parameters that are used in both models, and the total CO2 E-C rate, separate erosion rate, separate CO2 corrosion rate can then be obtained at different positions of the pipeline wall. Furthermore, the dominated rate is determined and analyzed, and based on the total CO2 E-C rate, the severity of the conjoint CO2 E-C is shaped. The proposed model can quickly and conveniently compute and determine the dominated rate and severity at different positions, and then further determine the weak positions and statuses where pipeline failures may happen. The model is expected to provide theoretical support for the prevention and daily risk management of carbon steel pipelines failures during the process of oil and gas production and transportation, so as to safely and reliably complete the established production tasks and maximize the economic benefits.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lei Zhao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yifei Yan", "Xiangzhen Yan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Semi-empirical model; CO2 erosion-corrosion; Carbon steel pipeline; Wet gas-solid flow; Solid particle erosion; CO2 corrosion", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 196, 2021, 107992, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920410520310470", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "16 Feb 2022"}
