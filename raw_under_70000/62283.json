Some parameters that can be used to identify the permeability zone is fracture and feed zone. Fracture intensity is used to identify the permeability zone, while Pressure-Temperature (P-T) curve slopes from the result o f completion tests are used to identify the feed zone. The objective o f this study is to model the permeability zone based on the spatial correlation between the high fracture intensity zone and the feed zone. In this study, the fracture intensity data was composited for each 10 m. Fracture intensity and P-T based on LPA and LPB wells (LPA1, LPA2, LPA3, LPA4, LPB1, LPB2, LPB3 and LPB6) which are located in the northern Wayang Windu geothermal field were used. Sequential Gaussian Simulation (SGS) method was used to identify the fracture intensity and P-T modeling, while Sequential Indicator Simulation method (SIS) was used for fracture direction modeling. The results o f the fracture intensity model using\nSGS shows that high fracture intensity is in the elevation o f 1,215 to 765 m.a.s.l with the major direction o f NE - SW. The feed zones for different bore holes were calculated using P-T curve slopes and discussed in this paper.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Khairul Azmi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/239847", "DAFTAR Khairul Azmi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/239848", "2020 KHAIRUL AZMI 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/239849", "2020 KHAIRUL AZMI 1-PAPER.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/239850"}, "Penulis": "Khairul Azmi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mohamad Nur Heriawan, Andy Yahya Al Hakim, Dwiyogarani Malik"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "fracture intensity, feed zone, permeability zone, Sequential Gaussian Simulation, Sequential Indicator Simulation.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani \u00a0\n                                     Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Des 2021"}
