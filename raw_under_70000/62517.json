{"Nomor": 62517, "Judul": "MULTI-FIDELITY GAUSSIAN PROCESS MODELING FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS", "Abstrak": "This thesis primarily discusses multi-fidelity Kriging methods in predicting\nvarious analytical and engineering cases. Although the Kriging model has cut\nthe computational cost/expense of numerical simulations, improving the performance\nof the Kriging model is still a hot topic nowadays. One of which is the\nmulti-fidelity Kriging methods which use the data from a cheaper simulations\nto assist the building process of the surrogate models. As a result, the multifidelity\nKriging method has more samples and information in the models than\nthe single-fidelity Kriging method with the same computational cost thus making\nthe model better. Three multi-fidelity Kriging methods will be studied and\napplied in this thesis. They are Cokriging, Hierarchical Kriging, and NARGP\n(Nonlinear Autoregressive Gaussian Process). Later, these three frameworks will\nbe tested into several cases which vary in terms of dimensions, complexity, to\nthe degree of correlation between the low- and high-fidelity responses. The results\nshow that Cokriging is the most robust and most consistent in modeling the\ncases especially the engineering cases. Hierarchical Kriging can be competitive to\nthe Cokriging results as long as an extremely good correlation between the lowand\nhigh-fidelity responses is available. NARGP has its own specialization which\nworks very well when the correlation between low- and high-fidelity responses has\na nonlinearly space-dependent correlation.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Febrian Akhmad Baehaqi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240792"}, "Penulis": "Febrian Akhmad Baehaqi [23620002]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Lavi Rizki Zuhal", "Pramudita Satria Palar, S.T., M.T., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Gaussian process, Multi-fidelity Kriging, Cokriging, Hierarchical Kriging, NARGP", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Jan 2022"}
