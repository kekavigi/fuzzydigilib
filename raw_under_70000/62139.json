{"Nomor": 62139, "Judul": "CHARACTERISTICS OF EPITHERMAL GOLD DEPOSITS IN CINEAM, WEST JAVA, INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "This study was aimed at characterizing epithermal gold deposits in Cineam, West Java, Indonesia. The geology of\nCineam is composed of an Oligo-Miocene series of volcanic Jampang formations. The Jampang formation is\ncomposed of Andecitic and Dasitic groups. The volcanic group was invaded by diorite, granodiorite, andesite,\nand dacite intrusive. Deposit formations are affected by the faults and anticlines of geology structures.\nUnderground mining. for gold has been conducted in this region using a simple tunnel cross in the direction of the\nvein. Characteristics and modeling deposits were observed using microscopes,reflectance, X-ray fluorescence\nspectroscopy (XRF), and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Based on a survey, the vein\nguartz direction was generally followed from N 330-350\u201d E with a 70\u201490\u201d dip and a thickness ranging from a\nJew centimeters to 60 cm. Mineralization in the Cineam area comprises gold deposits attributed to andesitic and\ndacite intrusions caused by the fault structure. Epithermal type is characterized by presences of gold- and base\nmetal-bearing guartz vein that occurred in lava and volcanic rocks. Samples were collected at different depths to\ndetermine the profile of the alteration zone. The argillic alteration zone was characterized by mineral illite,\nsmectite, and chlorite. Gold is associated with sulfide minerals, such as pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, and\ngalena.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Aldio Kresna Pambayu": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/239201", "2021 CHARACTERISTICS OF EPITHERMAL GOLD DEPOSITS 1-PAPER.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/239202"}, "Penulis": "Aldio Kresna Pambayu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Syafrizal, Arie Naftali Hawu Hede"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Rekayasa Pertambangan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "ephitermal, Cineam, gold", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Des 2021"}
