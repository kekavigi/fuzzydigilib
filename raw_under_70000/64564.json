There were several parameters used which were the rota- rod to test the strengthness of muscle while the anti-fatigue effect was determined by swimming test, blood glucose and blood lactate levels, and glycogen content in liver and muscle. The three doses of ZjFT (800, 1300, and 1900 mg/kg mice bw) able to increase significantly (p<0.05) on rota-rod time and swimming time. The medium and high doses of ZjFT can increase blood glucose level, reduced blood lactate accumulation and can maintain high level of glycogen storage in liver and muscle. Based on those data, it can be concluded that the Ziziphus jujuba fruit tea at doses of 1300 and 1900 mg/kg bw able to strengthens the muscle and used as anti-fatigue.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Chin Poh Ling": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/247108"}, "Penulis": "Chin Poh Ling [10710763]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Maria Immaculata Iwo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sains dan Teknologi Farmasi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Farmasi", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Mei 2022"}
