{"Nomor": 63479, "Judul": "DYNAMIC PERFORMANCE PREDICTION OF COALBED METHANE WELLS UNDER THE CONTROL OF BOTTOM-HOLE PRESSURE AND CASING PRESSURE", "Abstrak": "In the early production stage of coalbed methane (CBM) wells, especially in low permeability reservoirs, the method of shutting in casing annulus is usually adopted. However, the current commercial numerical simulation software fails to predict the dynamic performance of CBM wells under the control of both bottom-hole pressure and casing pressure. In this work, the calculation models of wellbore-pressure distribution and formation pressure distribution are derived firstly. Then, the above two models are coupled with several CBM dynamic performance analysis (CBMDPA) models developed in our previous researches, including pressure propagation model, water/gas productivity equations, dynamic permeability model, and material balance equation. A new CBMDPA program is developed with the coupling model, which can simulate the dynamic production performance of CBM wells after inputting the basic reservoir and fluid parameters, casing pressure, and bottom-hole pressure. Next, the newly developed CBMDPA program is validated against four field cases in China, and excellent agreements are obtained. The inputs of our CBMDPA program include casing pressure, bottom-hole pressure, and some deterministic and uncertain reservoir and fluid parameters. By adjusting the uncertain parameters, the gas production history can be fitted, and the uncertainty on the determination of reservoir properties can be addressed. On this basis, the future gas production is predicted using the determined parameters and the scheduled bottom-hole pressure and casing pressure. Finally, the influence of casing pressure on gas production is studied. Results show that high casing pressure has detrimental impact on the maximum daily gas production, while, it plays a positive role to achieve great desorption area, which will further prolong the stable gas production period. Under the high casing pressure of 2.5\u00a0MPa, the maximum daily production is decreased by about 54%, but the stable production stage is prolonged to more than 3000 days. It indicates that an appropriate range for casing pressure is favorable, considering both the accumulative gas production and the desorption area. For the case with representative properties from Muai block, the casing pressure is suggested to be 1\u20132\u00a0MPa, and the range between 1\u00a0MPa and 1.5\u00a0MPa is recommended for Hancheng block.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Juntai Shi [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Yanran Jia", "Jiayi Wu", "Fengyin Xu", "Zheng Sun", "Chengyuan Liu", "Ye Meng", "Xianyue Xiong", "Cheng Liu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Coalbed methane; Dynamic performance analysis; Bottom-hole pressure; Casing pressure; Liquid level; Low permeability", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 196, 2021, 107799, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920410520308603", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Feb 2022"}
