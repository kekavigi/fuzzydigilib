The field is under-saturated with 36\nAPI and average viscosity of 1.72 cp, with a high gas-oil ratio (GOR). Enhanced\nOil Recovery (EOR) applications then are highly recommended especially if\npossible, using gas that is highly produced from the same field. The first indications\nto use the Gas-Assisted Gravity Drainage (GAGD) method reveal that will not be\nthe suitable as many horizontal wells with shallow vertical depth.\nSimultaneous Gas Alternating Gas, (SGAG) is a new technique. To proceed, a\nreservoir compositional model is made to determine the tight oil reservoir's\nproperties and composition, then this method is implemented using two lateral wells\nunder each other with suitable vertical depth. Both of these injection wells are\nlocated lower than the production well with zero horizontal displacement. some\nscenarios for 20 years in this study, start by using the gas produced from the same\nwell (ProdG) direct from the gas separator, and second with using enhanced gas\n(ProdG30)after the separation of 50% process of methane gas that is available in\nthis produced gas. Then using CO2. The first two scenarios were tried by using the\nProdG and ProdG30 alternated with CO2. The best result using SGAG method\nduring using ProdG alternated with CO2 and Prodg30 was 33 and 44.2%\nrespectively. While during using ProdG30 it was better without alternating with\nCO2 slug it reached 54.2%.\nA comparison was made between SGAG and four conventional methods. results\nreflect a preference for using this new technique. The conventional methods that\ntheir performance checked here were GAG, normal one vertical in- between\ninjection well, WAG- W/ProdG30, SWAG-W/ProdG, SWAG-W/ProdG30. The\nbest results have gotten: 16.9, 31.22, 31.6, 27.4 and 34 respectively.\nSGAG is sensitive to vertical space between production and injection wells so that,\nfor tight reservoir formations, it is recommended in high thickness reservoirs.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Ammar Qaid Salem Al-Ghushaimi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/251281"}, "Penulis": "Ammar Qaid Salem Al-Ghushaimi [22220701]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
