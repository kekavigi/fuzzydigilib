{"Nomor": 62488, "Judul": "EVALUATION ON COAL RESOURCE ESTIMATION AND DRILLHOLE SPACING OPTIMIZATION BASED ON GEOSTATISTICAL APPROACH, WITH A CASE STUDY ON COAL DEPOSIT AT SOUTH KALIMANTAN, INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "The evaluation and classification on coal resource and reserve in Indonesia has been guided by SNI 1999 which is an Indonesian National Standard on coal resource and reserve estimation. However, this standard does not consider and discuss about any spatial variability on the variable being studied. The coal resource is classified based on the sample spacing and complexity of geological structures, but not taking into account the coal quantity and quality parameters. The complexity on geological structures does not always correspond to the complexity on coal seam geometric and qualities. Estimation variance in geostatistics i.e. generated by Ordinary Kriging method can be used to assess the spatial variability on coal geometric and qualities based on variogram modelling and estimation parameters. Therefore geostatistics can he used to evaluate the resource estimation and classcation which was estimated and classified as well using guidance of SNI 1999. Moreover, estimation variance can also he used to optimize the drillhole spacing on coal deposit by arranging some spacing and configuration then checking the change on spatial variability of coal variables. The coal resource evaluation takes a case study on two coal seams of Tanjung Formation where the geological structure is considered to be moderate and of Warukin Formation with relatively simple geological structure, both are located at South Kalimantan. The drillhole spacing optimization only takes a coal seam of Warukin Formation. The result showed that estimation variance by Ordinary Kriging was effective for coal resource evaluation and drillhole spacing optimization.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Mohamad Nur Heriawan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240667", "2011 M NUR HERIAWAN 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240668", "2011 M NUR HERIAWAN 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240669", "2011 M NUR HERIAWAN 1-PAPER.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240670"}, "Penulis": "Mohamad Nur Heriawan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Rudy Hendrawan Noor, Syafrizal, and Sudarto Notosiswoyo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "coal resources, drillhole spacing, estimation variance", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani \u00a0\n                                     Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Jan 2022"}
