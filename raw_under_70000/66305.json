{"Nomor": 66305, "Judul": "EVALUATION OF CRITICAL GAS RATE IN LIQUID LOADING GAS WELLS ON \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdB\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd AND \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdBL\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd FIELD", "Abstrak": "One of the common problems in gas wells, liquid loading, is a phenomenon when produced gas rate unable to lift produced liquid (water and/or condensate) to the surface. Liquid loading can cause many problems in gas well production which reduce the ultimate recovery of a gas well. The occurrence of liquid loading can be prevented by maintaining gas production rate higher than the liquid loading critical rate. The most common literature equations that have been used to predict liquid loading is Turner, Coleman, Nosseir, and Li equation. Evaluation for liquid loading theoretical equation implementation on real field condition is needed due to many uncertainties that can affect liquid loading phenomenon.\nThis paper discusses an approach in predicting liquid loading in gas well with the result of liquid loading theoretical equation implementation evaluation to determine the most compatible literature equation between Turner, Coleman, Li, and Nosseir in \u201cB\u201d and \u201cBL\u201d field, offshore gas condensate field in Riau Islands. Calculated literature liquid loading critical rate compared with field data to determine error value and literature critical rate to field data matching result. Matching data result evaluated and analyzed by determining well properties tendency.\nMatching result and analysis in this study show that for \u201cB\u201d and \u201cBL\u201d field, Turner equation gives the best matching result with matching percentage 40% and average error 33%. Therefore, this study recommends Turner equation with error correction adjustment \u00b133% for further critical rate calculation for \u201cB\u201d and \u201cBL\u201d field. The further liquid loading critical rate calculation can be used for liquid loading prediction and mitigation, production forecast, surface facility design allocation, and production optimization.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Widi Rossita Alawiyah": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250882"}, "Penulis": "Widi Rossita Alawiyah [12218072]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Silvya Dewi Rahmawati, S.Si., M.Si., Ph.D.", "Andru Ferdian."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "gas well, critical gas rate, liquid loading", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Jun 2022"}
