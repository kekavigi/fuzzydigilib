{"Nomor": 63217, "Judul": "EXPERIMENTAL STUDY: THE EFFECT OF SURFACTANT-POLYMER CONCENTRATION TO IMPROVE OIL RECOVERY FACTOR IN HOMOGENEOUS MICROMODEL", "Abstrak": "One of the methods for improving oil production was using the Enhanced Oil Recovery method with chemical injection. Combining two chemical solutions into a surfactant-polymer (SP) solution to take advantage of each solution behavior is expected to improve oil recovery significantly. The experiment was conducted by injecting different surfactant-polymer solutions into a homogenous micromodel, monitoring which solution behaved best, and comparing its performance to other compounds. This study aims to evaluate flow behavior and identify the recovery factor for displacing the oil that will result in the maximum incremental oil recovery. The results suggest that adjusting the concentrations of polymer and surfactant in surfactant-polymer mixtures is not always consistent with the previous study. Surfactant-polymer properties are defined by a unique set of characteristics that differ from surfactant and polymer properties. However, it can be proved that the surfactant-polymer solution outperforms earlier studies conducted on a homogeneous micromodel using the surfactant and polymer individually.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Muhammad Irfan Althoriq": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242336"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Irfan Althoriq [12216039]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
