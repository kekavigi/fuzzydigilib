{"Nomor": 67392, "Judul": "PREDIKSI KEJADIAN FLARE MENGGUNAKAN DIMENSI FRAKTAL BINTIK MATAHARI", "Abstrak": "Solar activities generate electromagnetic waves and energetic particles in\ngreat intensity that could be radiated towards the Earth. Such activity would\ninfluence the space environment around the Earth. One of the solar activities\nthat constantly monitored is solar flare. Radiation from solar flare could affect\nthe operational system of many satellites, decrease the intensity and accuracy\nof navigation and communication signal, and at some cases would disable electrical\ngrid on Earth\u2019s surface. Therefore, monitoring and prediction model of\nsolar flare continuously developed to mitigate the negative effect.\nMany prediction model use other solar activities as data input, one of which\nis sunspot. Sunspot formed in areas that have strong local magnetic activity,\nwhich corresponds with magnetic reconnection process that trigger the solar\nflare. One of sunspot\u2019s parameter that can be used in prediction is sunspot\u2019s\nfractal dimension, which represent the complexity of the sunspot structure,\nthereafter the energy and magnetic field that contained in that area.\nThis research will analyze sunspot fractal dimension to serve as input in\nsolar flare prediction. Solar image from SDO HMI Intensitygram will be used\nas primary data to determine the fractal dimension. Then solar image from\nground based observatory (PRA Bandung and BPAA Sumedang) will be used\nto compare the difference between space and ground based data. FIJI and\nFracLac are used to process the solar images and the sunspot fractal dimension.\nValues for sunspot fractal dimension that obtained in this research are around\n1.25 - 1.5 (regular box counting method) and 1.35 - 1.65 (multifractal method),\nwith positive correlation between fractal dimension and X-Ray flux. Sunspot\nfractal dimension also affected by sunspot\u2019s morphology and evolution.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Gerhana Puannandra Putri": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/256164"}, "Penulis": "Gerhana Puannandra Putri [20320012]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Dhani Herdiwijaya, M.Sc.", "Dr. Mahasenaputra", "Dr. rer. nat.
