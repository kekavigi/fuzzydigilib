{"Nomor": 62680, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT OF A WEB BASED ASRS WAREHOUSE MANAGEMENT IN A JIT PRODUCTION SYSTEM", "Abstrak": "Material distribution is one of the most crucial process in a supply chain. This study aims to create a web-based application to manage the distribution of materials in a production system. The application was modeled from Automatic Storage and Retrieval System, an automatic warehouse that contains autonomous components such as automated transportation within the warehouse. The application was implemented in the Production Lab of ITB\u2019s Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Faculty and can also be implemented in several other industries if needed.\nThe development of this web application used the Python programming language and the Django Framework. It also uses the SQLite database language to store and retrieve data. The ASRS was modelled using the Unified Modelling Language (UML) class diagram and use case diagram. The function that the website aimed to achieve are automated purchases of materials based on workstation needs, automated distribution of materials and provide a database of all objects and items in the system.\nThis study starts by modeling an ASRS using UML use case diagram, UML case diagram and a physical design model. Afterwards, the model is used to develop a code using the Django framework. This resulted in the creation of a web application with the goals stated above.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Jordi M. A.
