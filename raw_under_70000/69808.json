{"Nomor": 69808, "Judul": "PENERAPAN METODE DEKONVOLUSI EULER DAN PEMODELAN SISTEM PANAS BUMI MENGGUNAKAN DATA GRAVITASI DI DAERAH PARIANGAN, SUMATERA BARAT", "Abstrak": "Indonesia has a large potential of geothermal resources, however it has not been\nfully harvested yet, therefore it is necessary to research areas with geothermal\nresources. One of which is the Pariangan geothermal area in Tanah Datar\nRegency, West Sumatra Province which is the object of this research. To identify\nthe geological structure and subsurface model of the Pariangan geothermal area,\ntopography and gravity data from a research by PSDG in 2014 as well as other\nsupporting data such as geological, geochemical, and geophysical data were used.\nIn this study, complete Bouguer anomaly was calculated which was then made\ninto a complete Bouguer anomaly map, then regional and residual anomaly maps\nwere made using a window size 7 moving average and 3rd polynomial order trend\nsurface analysis filter. The location and depth of the Pariangan geological\nstructures were estimated using the Euler deconvolution method. Based on the\nresidual anomaly map, an anomaly pattern with a northwest\u2013southeast trend can\nbe identified which represents faults. Based on the Euler deconvolution solution,\nfaults which are predominant at a depth of <900 m can be identified. The\nPariangan subsurface model consists of andesite, serpentine insert in a fault, and\nslate as the bedrock. The Pariangan geothermal system conceptual model consists\nof a heat source from the volcanic activity of Mount Marapi, a reservoir that is\nestimated to be old andesite, a caprock that is estimated to be young andesite that\nunderwent argillic alteration, a recharge area around the peak of Mount Marapi,\nand a discharge area at the foot of Mount Marapi in the form of Pariangan Hot\nSpring as a result of upflow and Sopan Didih Warm Spring as a result of outflow.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Ivan Bertrand Reynaldi Widagdo.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/267613"}, "Penulis": "Ivan Bertrand Reynaldi Widagdo [12318010]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Susanti Alawiyah, S.T., M.T.", "Dr. Dadi Abdurrahman, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Geofisika - FTTM", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Earth sciences", "Kata Kunci": "Dekonvolusi Euler, gravitasi, moving average, panas bumi, Pariangan, pemodelan ke depan 2.5D, trend surface analysis polinomial", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Devi Septia Nurul", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Nov 2022"}
