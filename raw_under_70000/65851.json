A crack could form in almost every material. Crack\nformation is usually an undesirable phenomenon. In many cases, a crack is\nvery harmless. However in some situation, it could lead to a fatal incident.\nTherefore, research in fracture mechanics need to be continuously developed.\nOne way to analyze a crack is by determining the strain energy release rate\nparameter. The strain energy release rate is the energy that is used up during\nfracture formation per fracture surface area. The strain energy release rate\ncould be calculated using the virtual crack extension or the virtual crack closure\ntechnique methods. In this paper, both virtual crack extension and the virtual\ncrack closure technique are applied to obtain the strain energy release rate of\nan even loaded cracked plate with fixed boundary. For the simulation, the\nauthor varies the element size, the crack length, and the plate thickness. The\nresults show that the virtual crack closure technique method tend to gives\nmore accurate outcome. The strain energy release rate tends to increase as\nthe crack length increases but decreases as the plate gets thicker.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Enrico Samuel Rusli": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250246"}, "Penulis": "Enrico Samuel Rusli [13618052]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
