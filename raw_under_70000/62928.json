{"Nomor": 62928, "Judul": "TEMPERATURE GRADIENT AND PH EFFECTS ON SOR ESTIMATES FROM SWCT TESTS - THE NO BUFFER CASE", "Abstrak": "Residual oil saturation (Sor) is the fraction of immobile oil that remains after a water flood. This information is important for calculating recoverable reserves and evaluating EOR campaigns. Single Well Chemical Tracer (SWCT) tests yield a near-well average Sor based on a large rock volume. Correctly performed and analyzed, SWCT tests yield reliable Sor estimates. There are, however, two important effects that commonly are ignored. One is cooling of the reservoir during injection of the cold brine resulting in decreased hydrolysis rate of the primary tracer. The other is the hydrolysis rate's pH dependence. To study these phenomena, we have developed a numerical model of an ethyl acetate SWCT test and applied it to a generic case with test and formation data based on published values. An analytical model is used to calculate how the brine injection temperature varies with time. The ethyl acetate hydrolyses into ethanol and acetic acid that lowers the pH and changes the hydrolysis rate. Any buffer capacity in the injected fluid or formation is neglected. Our model is the first ever to combine realistic temperature calculations with pH dependent ethyl acetate hydrolysis rate during a SWCT test. Sor is estimated from synthetic tracer production curves using the direct chromatographic separation equation as well as the mean residence time. A large number of simulations were performed to investigate how the Sor estimates vary with different model assumptions and input data. In all cases, both methods underestimate the true Sor, typically by 2\u20134% - in some cases significantly more. We demonstrate that neglecting dispersion in the wellbore during injection and production is warranted with the rock and test data used in this study.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Tom Pedersen [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Sor; SWCT test; Ethyl acetate; Temperature gradient; pH; No buffer", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 196, 2021, 107652, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920410520307191", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Jan 2022"}
