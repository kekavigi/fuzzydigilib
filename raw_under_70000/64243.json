{"Nomor": 64243, "Judul": "COMSOL MODEL SIMPLIFICATION AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF PRODUCTION PARAMETERS IN SINGLE-PHASE, TWO-DIMENSIONAL, AXISYMMETRIC HEAVY OIL RECOVERY BY RADIO FREQUENCY HEATING", "Abstrak": "Heavy oils are an important resource for the future of humanity. Today, however, less than 1% of these resources are produced or actively developed, making them lucrative as objects of further studies in petroleum industry, especially those related to enhanced recovery of heavy oils, including the use of electromagnetic heating. Despite that heavy oil reservoirs in all around the world are promising to be developed and produced, high viscosity has been a major concern for the oil recovery from those reservoirs.\nElectromagnetic heating stimulation for heavy oil recovery is modeled by coupling Darcy\u2019s Law and Heat Transfer modules in COMSOL Multiphysics in order to simplify previous works by Carrizales using Partial Differential Equation module. Sensitivity of recovery factor after 23 months of project implementation toward frequency, power, permeability, and API gravity is then analyzed. The model is single-phase, two-dimensional, and axisymmetric in nature.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Yosaka Eka Putranta": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246017"}, "Penulis": "Yosaka Eka Putranta [12209013]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
