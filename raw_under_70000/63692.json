{"Nomor": 63692, "Judul": "A MODIFIED GAS FLOW MODEL IN THE NEAR WELLBORE REGION BELOW DEW POINT PRESSURE", "Abstrak": "ww.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S240565612100002X)\nAbstract: When pressure in gas reservoirs fall below the dew point, condensate banking occurs around the wellbore which alters the fluid flow behavior. The state of the knowledge on this flow behavior is yet not fully-developed; which leads to severe problems in field. In this study, the Al-Hussainy, Ramey, and Crawford Solution Technique has been modified to accurately resemble the real gas flow behavior for this condition. First, a primary investigation was conducted to observe the severity of the problem in three condensate banked reservoirs. Then this study involved Constant Composition Expansion tests for determining the dew point, Prode Properties software for modeling the reservoir fluid properties, Flowing Material Balance (or Dynamic P/Z Material Balance) for identifying the pressure distribution of the selected reservoirs. The real field data along with the determined (analytical, computational, and experimental) data were incorporated to check the validity of the models. The modification proposes a Dimensionless Correction Factor (CD) for any condensate banked reservoir and identifies parameters such as the Perforation Factor (Pf) and Heterogeneity Factor (n). It is found that the Modified Al-Hussainy, Ramey, and Crawford Solution Technique successfully models the actual flow characteristics of the stated condition.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Abed Inan Chowdhury [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Md Mostafijul Karim"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Condensate banking; Effective permeability; Gas flow modeling; Model fitting", "Sumber": "Petroleum, Volume 7, Issue 3, 2021, Pages 294-302, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S240565612100002X", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Feb 2022"}
