{"Nomor": 64336, "Judul": "ENZYMATIC CHARACTERIZATION OF H47K RECOMBINANT CYCLODEXTRIN GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE MUTEIN USING SAGO STARCH AS SUBSTRATE", "Abstrak": "Cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase, EC 2.4.1.19) is an enzyme that produces cyclodextrin (CD) from starch. In this research, we observed effects of residue 47 substitution on several characteristics of CGTase enzyme. 1147K mutant cgtase gene was constructed from synthetic WT cgtase gene of Bacillus sp. A2-5a with optimum codons for expression in Escherichia coil BL2I(DE3). The soluble 1-147K rCGTase was produced in E. coil BL21(DE3) by 0.1 mM IPTG induction for 24 hours at 27 \u00b0C. The soluble H47K rCGTase was purified by Ni-NTA resin. Purified H47K rCGTase had 79.38% recovery and 14.7-fold purification compared to total cytoplasmic protein. Its specific enzymatic activity was 12.05 U/mg. The (3-cyclization and starch hydrolysis activity of the enzyme was observed qualitatively by zymography using phenolphthalein and 12/K1 as indicator dye. Quantification of (3-CD that catalyzed by the enzyme was measured by visible spectrophotometer at 550 nm using phenolphthalein as dye indicator. The optimum temperature and pH for this enzyme to catalyze I3-CD were 60 \u00b0C and 7, respectively. The enzyme retained its half activity at 63.63 \u00b0C for 30 minutes and stable at a wide pH in the range of 5.3-9.7. The cyclization ratio of H47K rCGTase for a-: y-CD was 0 : 63 : 37 in 5h incubation time and 12 : 70 : 8 in 24h incubation time. This character was observed using HPLC with NH2 column and RI detector. The mobile phase was water : acetonitrile (30 : 70) with 1 mL.min-1 flow rate. Corn, modified cassava, rice, sago, soluble potato, tapioca starch, and wheat flour was tested in modified Horikoshi medium to observe substrate range for H47K rCGTase. H47K rCGTase had highest 13-CD product with gelatinized sago starch as substrate. The kinetic parameters of H47K rCGTase with gelatinized sago starch was observed on the optimum condition. The kinetic parameters (Vmax, Km, Kcat and .Eff) of H47K rGCTase in (3-CD production using sago starch were 8.7x10-4 pg.mUlmin-i, 39.74 ug.mL-1, 0.22 min-I, and 249-.63, respectively. This research reported the shifting of H47K rCGTase product from (3-CD to y-CD during 5h incubation time and shifting from 13/y-CD to a-CD during 24h incubation time", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "David [10709079]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["apt.
