{"Nomor": 62503, "Judul": "A NOVEL TRIPLE-POROSITY MODEL FOR FRACTURED-VUGGY RESERVOIRS BASED ON MAXWELL-GARNETT MIXING RULE", "Abstrak": "Under the new energy pattern, the petrophysical properties of carbonate reservoirs are still the research focus in\nthe petroleum industry. Compared with conventional reservoirs, the calculation of water saturation is more\ncomplicated for carbonate reservoirs. One of the main challenges is that the accurate calculation of the porosity\nexponent of the reservoirs is influenced by the development of fractures and vugs. The existing triple-porosity\nmodel provides a way to calculate the porosity exponents; however, the existing model still has some problems:\n(1) The conduction theory adopted to establish the model varies from the actual conductivity process of the\nreservoir; (2) The model is deduced from the effective medium theory and regional empirical formula without\nconsidering the fracture shapes, thus it is not applicable for the carbonate reservoirs with fractures developed.\nTherefore, this paper proposed a novel triple-porosity model to calculate the porosity exponents by applying the\nMaxwell-Garnett mixing rule to the fractured-vuggy reservoir. This novel model can calculate the porosity exponents\nof reservoirs with the joint development of the vugs (non-connected vugs), fractures (fractures and\nconnected vugs), and matrix pores. From the results of the novel model, the more developed the vugs, the greater\nthe porosity exponents, and the more developed the fractures, the smaller the porosity exponent. Therefore, the\nporosity exponents of the reservoir can reflect the combined influence of the vugs, fractures and matrix pores. In\norder to effectively calculate the water saturation through this model, a method based on the binary processing of\nthe Full-bore Formation Micro-Imager (FMI) logs was further proposed to calculate the vug porosity and fracture\nporosity. The field application demonstrated that the novel triple-porosity model can accurately calculate the\nwater saturation of the fractured-vuggy reservoirs and provide guidance to the actual production.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Jie Tian [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Li qiang Sima", "Liang Wang", "Hong qi Liu", "Chang Li", "Rong Yin", "Bing Xie"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Porosity exponent, Fractured-vuggy reservoirs, Matrix pores, Vugs, Fractures", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering,Volume 208, Part A,\u00a0January 2022, 109362", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Jan 2022"}
