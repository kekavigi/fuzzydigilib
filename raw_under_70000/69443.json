In this study, aims to\nevaluate the potential of living and dead biomass to remove Cd (II) and Cr (VI)\nions from aqueous solution and surface water. The microalgae were taken from\nIPAL Bojongsuang. The result of isolated was indicated as Spirulina sp. FTIR\nspectrum of biomass revealed the presence of amino acid (-NH2), carbonyl (-\nC=O), carboxyl (-COOH) and hydroxyl (-OH) groups. The scanning electron\nmicrograph clearly revealed the surface texture and morphology of the biosorbent\nand biosorptive of heavy metals was significant effected by pretreatment of\nsorbents. The results shown that HCl and Na2CO3 were gives maximum\nimprovement on biosorption of 88.70% on Cd (II) removal and 85.50% on Cr\n(VI) removal. Biosorption of Cd (II) and Cr (VI) ions were evaluated under\ndifferent conditions that included pH, temperature, biomass concentration, metal\nconcentration and contact time were studied. Maximum metal uptake was\nobserved at pH = 6 and pH = 2 respectively. Maximum metal uptake (qmax) of Cd\n(II) and Cr (VI) were 23.98 and 26.38 mg/g respectively. Mechanism of Cr (VI)\nremoval was observed as Cr (VI) reduced to Cr (III), the optimum reduction was\nfound at 45? was observed 87.30%. The biosorbed metal ions was recovered using 65% (v/v) HNO3, 0.1M HCl, 0.5M EDTA, 0.1M NaOH as regenerants. The\ndesorption test revealed that HNO3 was the best for the elution of metals from the\ntested microalgae, the recovery percentage of 100% was observed. Biosorption of\nCd (II) and Cr (VI) from surface water was investigated. Which shown that\nmicroalgae were potential to remove these heavy metal ions from surface water.\nThe biosorption of Cd (II) ion was followed well with Langmuir isotherm model\nwith R2 = 0.9988 and Freundlich model was fitted better for Cr (VI) with R2 =\n0.9966. The biosorption of Cd (II) ion was followed the pseudo-first-order\nkinetic, which evidence of single site adsorption. Whereas Cr (VI) was by Ho\u2019s\npseudo-second-order kinetics confirming a multisite interaction. Biosorption of\nthese ions by microalgae was controlled by chemisorption involving valence\nforces through sharing or exchange of electrons between sorbent and sorbate.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Inthaboon Phonethip": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/261551", "BAB 1 Inthaboon Phonethip": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/261552", "BAB 2 Inthaboon Phonethip": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/261553", "BAB 3 Inthaboon Phonethip": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/261554", "BAB 4 Inthaboon Phonethip": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/261555", "BAB 5 Inthaboon Phonethip": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/261556", "PUSTAKA Inthaboon Phonethip": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/261557", "LAMPIRAN Inthaboon Phonethip": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/261558"}, "Penulis": "Inthaboon Phonethip [25317703]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Qomarudin Helmy, S.Si., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Lingkungan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Sipil dan Lingkungan", "Subjek": "Engineering & allied operations", "Kata Kunci": "Biosorption, Cd (II) and Cr (VI) removal, microalgae, Citarum river, batch experiment.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "8 file", "Tanggal Input": "03 Okt 2022"}
