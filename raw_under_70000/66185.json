{"Nomor": 66185, "Judul": "IMPROVE CHEMICAL FLOODING WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF WELL RE-ENGINEERING AND STIMULATION", "Abstrak": "Chemical flooding is a promising method for enhanced oil recovery and is often applied because it can increase sweep efficiency and displacement efficiency. Surfactant-polymer (SP) flooding was chosen because it was found to be effective for implementation in the studied field.\nThe new approach to combine hydraulic fracturing with chemical flooding is being studied by using a commercial simulator and it hopes to get more promising in oil recovery increment. Hydraulic fracturing is expected to increase oil recovery by creating a path between injection wells and production wells, so it can increase the exposure between oil and chemical. There are two additional scenarios (in addition to the basic scenario, which is chemical flooding in vertical injection wells) that will be compared, first is the combination of chemical-fracturing in vertical injection wells and second is chemical flooding in horizontal injection wells. Sensitivity tests were also carried out on fracture parameters, horizontal well parameters and chemical concentration to determine the optimal condition of the increase in oil recovery.\nBased on the simulation results, for each of both additional scenarios above provides a greater increase in oil recovery than only applying chemical flooding in vertical injection wells, with an addition of about 15.6% in the combination of chemical-fracturing in vertical injection wells scenario and 2.5% in the chemical flooding in horizontal injection wells scenario. It turns out that the combination of chemical-fracturing in vertical injection wells scenario produced more in oil recovery than the chemical flooding in horizontal injection wells scenario. Implementation of the new approach to combine hydraulic fracturing with chemical flooding is also considered more profitable than the other scenario, providing better NPV and IRR value. PSC gross split proved to be more profitable for contractor than cost recovery.\nThe results of this study can be used to consider the new approach of the combination of chemical-fracturing on a field scale especially in Indonesia with the aim of increasing the success rate and improvement of the operation, because this technology globally is rarely found in practice.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Desta Darma Aliyuda": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250689"}, "Penulis": "Desta Darma Aliyuda [12218058]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Silvya Dewi Rahmawati, S.Si., M.Si., Ph.D.", "Ahmad Reizky Azhar, S.T., M.Sc."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Chemical flooding, hydraulic fracturing, re-engineering well", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Jun 2022"}
