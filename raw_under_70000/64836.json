FinTech Lending has been a solution\nto get easier loan application process for borrowers who do not meet the loan\nrequirements at the Bank. Hence, a credit scoring system is necessary to minimize\ncredit risk. This research is focused on building a model which can predict whether\nthe loan applicants will default or not. The model is expected to maintain the simple\ncharacteristics of Fin Tech Lending. The prediction of whether the loan will default\nor not is based on a Logistic Regression and Bayesian Logistic Regression model\nwith JO variables. ln addition to predicting loan behavior, this research aims to\nview the effect of each variables to the loan behavior. The result shows no\nsignificant difference on the performance from all the models. However, the\nBayesian Logistic Regression model with informative prior requires longer\nduration to compute and perform below the Bayesian Logistic Regression model\nwithout informative prior.", "Daftar File": {"2022 TA PP NETHANIA VERENA": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/248215"}, "Penulis": "NETHANIA VERENA SUDARMO [10818018]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sapto Wahyu Indratno, S.Si., M.Sc., Ph.D"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Aktuaria", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "LPMUBT, skor kredit, regresi logistik,  regresi logistik buyes", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Dwi Ary Fuziastuti \u00a0\n                                     Dwi Ary Fuziastuti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Jun 2022"}
