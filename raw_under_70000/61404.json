{"Nomor": 61404, "Judul": "DESAIN INTERAKSI SYNCHRONOUS ONLINE LEARNING MENGGUNAKAN VIDEOCONFERENCING", "Abstrak": "The COVID-19 pandemic accelerates the digitalization of various field and education is one of\nthem. For that reason, it is necessary for teacher and student to adapt their learning method into\ne-learning. However, the tools to accommodate specially e-learning is lacking. To resolve this\nproblem, there is a need to create a new interaction design to accommodate e-learning with\nbetter efficiency. Therefore, this paper focuses on helping both students and teachers to carry\nout e-learning efficiently. The interaction design implemented according to goal-directed\ndesign (GDD) methodology. GDD has 5 steps, which is, research, modeling, requirement,\nframework, and refinement. Based on observation and literature study, there is 13 features that\ndivided into 4 functionalities, the features are, Videoconferencing, Audioconferencing, Instant\nmessaging, Remote control, Shared desktop and application, File sharing, Shared whiteboard,\nAnnotations, Question and pools, Instant Feedback, Presence control, Log, and Division into\ngroup. The usability goal is efficient to use, and the user experience goal is helpful. Both goals\nare based on the focus of helping students and teachers to carry out e-learning efficiently. There\nare four metrics that used to measure achievability of usability and user experience goals. To\nmeasure usability goal, system usability scale (SUS) and overall relative efficiency are used.\nTo measure user experience goal, value/usefulness subscale from intrinsic motivation\ninventory (IMI) is used. Lastly Simple Ease Question (SEQ) is used to measure the\nachievability of the interaction design. The results from testing show a value of 89,5 for the\nSUS metric, 80,37% for the overall relative efficiency, 6,8 for the IMI metric, and 6,9 for SEQ\nmetric. Based on these number, can be conclude that usability and user experience have been\nachieved.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Vijjasena": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/236253"}, "Penulis": "Vijjasena [13517084]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Adi Mulyanto, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Informatika", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Teknik Elektro dan Informatika", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "e-learning, videoconferencing, goal-directed design, usability testing", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Sep 2021"}
