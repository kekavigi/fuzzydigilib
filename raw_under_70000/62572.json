{"Nomor": 62572, "Judul": "ASSESSMENT OF GRANITOID-RELATED MINERALIZATION USING VISIBLE NEAR-INFRARED AND SHORTWAVE INFRARED REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY", "Abstrak": "Reflectance spectroscopy is used to determine mineral species in the laboratory and as a basis Jor the optical remote sensing method, which is used to create mineral distribution maps in a particular area. This paper describes the use of reflectance spectroscopy for the identification of granitoid-related mineralization. Visible near-infrared (VNIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) within the range of 350 to 2,500 nm were utilized in this research project. The Analytical Spectral Devices FieldSpec4 was used as a spectrometer to obtain reflectance data from samples taken from various locations in the granitic rock environment in the \u201cTin Island\u201d in Bangka, Indonesia. Reflectance data values were smoothed using a Savitzky-Golay filter, and the graph results were analyzed using the Spectral Geologist and SPECMIN programs to identifs the minerals contained in the samples. Both programs use unigue characteristics: i.e., they analyze absorption features that occur in the VNIR and SWIR regions of the spectral pattern. The results of the reflectance spectroscopy were validated using X-ray diffraction for mineral identification, element content analysis, and microscopic observation. The mineral composition results based on the spectral analysis were in line with the results derived using other methods. Moreover, these spectra can be used in remote sensing analysis for mineral distribution mapping.", "Daftar File": {"2018 ARIE NAFTALI HAWU HEDE 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240956", "2018 ARIE NAFTALI HAWU HEDE 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240957", "2018 ARIE NAFTALI HAWU HEDE 1-PAPER.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240958", "COVER Arie Naftali Hawu Hede": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240959"}, "Penulis": "Arie Naftali Hawu Hede [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Syafrizal and Steven Gunawan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Reflectance spectroscopy, near-infrared (VNIR), X-ray", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Jan 2022"}
