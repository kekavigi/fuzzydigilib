{"Nomor": 63162, "Judul": "PREDICTION OF NEW PERFORATION INTERVALS IN A DEPLETED RESERVOIR TO ACHIEVE THE MAXIMUM PRODUCTIVITY: A CASE STUDY OF PNN LOGGING IN A CASED-WELL OF AN IRANIAN OIL RESERVOIR", "Abstrak": "Pulsed neutron-neutron (PNN) logging is based on emitting neutrons into the near-wellbore zone and computing the neutron count decay due to scattering and capturing. The main application of this logging tool is to determine the current oil saturation and to detect channeling in perforated and non-perforated intervals behind the casing. Correct interpretation of the results obtained from PNN logging enables engineers to predict new perforation intervals in depleted reservoirs. This study examines the application of PNN logging in a well located in one of Iranian oil reservoirs. The interpretation procedure is described step by step. The principle of the PNN logging and the specifications of the tool are discussed and the applications of PNN logging in evaluation of oil saturation, identification of water flooded zones and prediction of potential perforating zones are described. Channeling is also investigated between all layers, good and poor oil zones are characterized based on the calculated oil saturations and new perforation intervals are suggested with the aim to boost oil production from the reservoir. The results of this study show that zones 1 to 5 having low oil saturations, are interpreted as depleted oil zones. Zones 6 to 8 are interpreted as good oil zones having high potential to produce oil. Zone 9 is interpreted as a water zone.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Saeed Zaker [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Shahab Mohamadi Nafchi", "Mahdi Rastegarnia", "Soheila Bagheri", "Ali Sanati", "Amir Naghibi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Pulse neutron-neutron (PNN) logging; Sigma value; Remaining oil saturation; Conventional logging; Perforation intervals; Depleted reservoir", "Sumber": "Petroleum, Volume 6, Issue 2, 2020, Pages 170-176, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405656118300014", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Jan 2022"}
