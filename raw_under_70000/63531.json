{"Nomor": 63531, "Judul": "GEOCHEMICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE NEWLY DISCOVERED OIL-TYPE SHALE IN THE SHUANGCHENG AREA OF THE NORTHERN SONGLIAO BASIN, CHINA", "Abstrak": "For the past fifty years, the northern Songliao Basin in China was thought to contain Lower Cretaceous coal-measure and gas-generating shale. Oil-type shales did not receive much attention until oil exploration activities made a breakthrough in the Southern Shuangcheng (SSC) depression. In this study, the geochemical characteristics of the newly discovered K1yc4 (fourth member of the Lower Cretaceous YingCheng Formation) oil-type shale in the SSC depression were analyzed, including the organic matter abundance, organic matter type, thermal maturity, hydrocarbon potential, and sedimentary environment. A total of 393 core samples were collected, and Rock-Eval pyrolysis, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), organic petrography, carbon isotope analysis, and constant and trace element analyses were conducted. The K1yc4 shale was determined to have a good to excellent hydrocarbon potential with high TOC values (mostly 2.0\u20134.0%). The organic matter was mainly from lower hydrobiont, algae, bacteria, and lesser amounts of terrestrial plants. The organic matter is mainly type I to type II based on the hydrogen index (HI) (average HI\u00a0=\u00a0193.36\u00a0mg HC/g TOC), the carbon isotopes of the kerogen (mostly ?26 to ?30\u2030), and the organic petrography (average sapropelinite\u00a0+\u00a0liptinite of 55.0\u00a0vol%). The maturity parameters, i.e., Tmax (mean 452\u00a0\u00b0C) and vitrinite reflectance (0.8\u20131.1%), suggest that the shale is in the mature thermal evolution stage. The shale's maximum hydrocarbon-generating intensity is up to 713.29\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104/km2, and its hydrocarbon-expelling intensity is stable at 116.63\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104/km2. The constant and trace element analyses (Sr, Ba, V, Ni, Cr, Ti) revealed that the organic matter deposition and preservation occurred in a fresh-brackish and dysoxic-anoxic water environment. Volcanic eruptions probably played a vital role in the enrichment of the organic matter in the oil-type shale. In addition, the results of this study provide evidence that the Lower Cretaceous strata in the northern Songliao Basin meet the geological conditions of oil-prone shale, which expands the petroleum exploration horizon in this region.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Chao Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Wanchun Zhao", "Lidong Sun", "Xiaolian Wang", "Youhai Sun", "Ying Zhang", "Jingjing Zhang", "Lei Zhang", "Jijun Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Shale; Geochemistry; Hydrocarbon potential; Shuangcheng depression; Songliao basin", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 196, 2021, 107755, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920410520308184", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "16 Feb 2022"}
