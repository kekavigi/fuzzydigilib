{"Nomor": 66587, "Judul": "TECHNO-ECONOMIC BASED CAPACITY OPTIMIZATION OF  MULTIPLE COMBINATIONS OF VIRTUAL POWER PLANT  CONSIDERING HYBRID SOLAR-WIND FARMS AND FOUR  DIFFERENT ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES", "Abstrak": "Concern for the climate change demands for a faster adoption of Variable \nRenewable Energy Sources (VRES). VRES (solar and wind energy) are targeted to supply \n53% of the Indonesia\u2019s 2060 total power demand, three times of that of 2020. But \ndeploying VRES brings about reliability issue due to its intermittency, which consequently \nrequires additional costs for the deployment of Energy Storage Systems (ESS). Since a \nfully reliable VRES project is expensive, it is attractive to consider decreasing portion of \nreliability to reduce costs for the project to be economically viable. \nThis study investigates the deployment of multiple combinations of solar PV \nground, solar PV rooftop, wind turbine, Battery ESS, Pumped Hydro ESS, Hydrogen ESS, \nand Ammonia ESS in 16 Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) to meet Sukabumi Municipality \ndemand, under three scenarios: full demand (33 MW), peak demand (4 MW), and baseload \ndemand (29 MW). Multi-objective optimization based on Strength Pareto Evolutionary \nAlgorithm 2 (SPEA2) is conducted with objectives of minimizing both Levelized Cost of \nEnergy (LCOE) for costs and Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP) for reliability. \nThe optimization program based on SPEA2 has successfully generate Pareto Front \nresults for 16 VPPs and three case studies, along with a support program. It has been found \nthat every VPP with Pumped Hydro ESS in single, double, triple and quadruple ESS, ranks \nco-first as the best VPP. Finally, four major factors which affect techno-economic \nperformance of VPPs have been identified: LCOEgen of VRES, VRES maximum capacity \ndue to location specificity, matching of VRES generation profile and demand profile, and \nroundtrip efficiency of ESS", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Ghany Anugrah Muhammad Anais": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/251418"}, "Penulis": "Ghany Anugrah Muhammad Anais [13117090]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Eng.
