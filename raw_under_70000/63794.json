{"Nomor": 63794, "Judul": "WATER CONTENT DELINEATION USING GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR Q TOMOGRAPHY", "Abstrak": "Investigation to determine the Q-factor from transmission Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) waves by using the\nequivalent bandwidth (EBW) method and its applicability is examined through tomographical reconstruction. Q\nis inversely proportional to the absorption coefficient and describes the material-specific absorption of different\nrocks. The EBW method is based on the frequency-independent Q and the velocity dispersion after Futterman. We\ntest its applicability to delineate water content distribution in a 30 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm sandstone block from the\nElbe Sandstone Mountain, Germany. Synchronous Measurement with a PulseEkko-1000 GPR system and 900\nMHz antennas was conducted only from 2 opposite ends of the test object due to physical constraint. The\nmeasurements were taken in such a way that from each transmitter position, data is received at all receivers. Due\nto the small test object, it is impossible to complete record full 5-phase transmission signals. Despite this\nconstraint, practical analysis of using shortened transmission signal still provide a good Q estimate. Our results\nconclude that calculated velocity values from the tomography measurement data show a significant velocity\ndecrease with increasing position, which correlates with the increasing water content and the higher the Q value\nthe smaller the water content value", "Daftar File": {"2019 - Cover - Wahyudi Widyatmoko": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/244726", "2019 - Editorial Board - Wahyudi Widyatmoko": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/244727", "2019 - Table Content - Wahyudi Widyatmoko": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/244728", "2019 - Paper - Wahyudi Widyatmoko": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/244729"}, "Penulis": "Wahyudi W.
