{"Nomor": 62714, "Judul": "THE APPLICATION OF GEOMECHANICAL SAGD DILATION STARTUP IN A XINJIANG OIL FIELD HEAVY-OIL RESERVOIR", "Abstrak": "Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) methods have been widely applied in oil-sands exploitation globally. SAGD processes are effective only after thermal and hydraulic communication between the injector and producer has been established during the start-up operation of the well pair. The geomechanical SAGD dilation startup has been considered a promising technology that can enhance permeabilities of heavy-oil reservoirs and reduce thermal conformance time. However, limited studies have focused on the practical operational procedures of geomechanical SAGD dilation startup. This paper presents the application of SAGD dilation startup technology in a shallow super heavy-oil reservoir in the Karamay oil ?eld, China. The general reservoir geology and geo-mechanical characteristics were investigated and used to propose a practical approach to determine dilation initiation pressure. We also summarize the SAGD well completions and geomechanical SAGD dilation startup procedures. A case study using a real SAGD well is presented and analyzed. We then share the ?eld operation procedures and results after dilation startup. The objective of the research was to reduce the steam circulation time and achieve uniform thermal conformance along the SAGD well. Our ?eld results highlight the promising potential of using water injection to create a dilated zone and dramatically enhance reservoir permeability. The performance of SAGD dilation startup in the Karamay oil ?eld is evaluated by comparing the cumulative oil production rate with those from SAGD wells using conventional startup.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Xingge Sun [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Bin Xu", "Genbao Qian", "Biao Li"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Geomechanics; Dilation startup; Dilation initiation pressure; SAGD; Thermal recovery", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 196,\u00a0January 2021, 107670, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920410520307373", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Jan 2022"}
