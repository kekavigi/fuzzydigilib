{"Nomor": 66235, "Judul": "SIPHON STRING INSTALLATION TO OPTIMIZE WELL PRODUCTION AND REDUCE THE SLUG FLOW", "Abstrak": "Well A is an oil production well that has been drilled using the horizontal well method from zone X. Zone X\nhas a temperature of 2050 F, a pressure of 600 psi, and water cut by 25%. Tubing in well A has an inside\ndiameter of 2.75\", and the casing installed has an inside diameter of 5.5\". Well A cannot produce with the\nnatural flow, so the gas lift is injected into the tubing at a depth of 5046 ft-MD and a rate of 0.6 MMSCFD as an\nartificial lift method.\nTo optimize the production rate and reduce the slug flow on tubing, the siphon string will be installed inside\nthe tubing to give a deeper injection point without recompletion. This thesis is conducted to analyze the siphon\nstring installation in some cases, such as extending the length of the siphon string, deepening the depth of the\nsiphon string and gas lift point of injection, sensitivity to gas lift injection rate, sensitivity with tubing diameter,\nand sensitivity with GOR of reservoir.\nFrom several cases carried out by well modeling, deepening the point of gas lift injection by installing the\nsiphon string increases the production rate of well A and reduces the slug flow in the tubing. If the siphon string\nis extended to a depth below SSSV (577 ft-MD), it will increase the production rate. However, economic\ncalculations must be carried out to determine whether it is profitable. The production of well A increases along\nwith the gas lift rate, and the maximum gas lift rate injection can reduce the slug flow on the tubing. Siphon\nstring installation also can optimize the well production and reduce slug flow with a bigger tubing diameter.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Healthy Febriana Jessica": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250767"}, "Penulis": "Healthy Febriana Jessica [12218005]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Silvya Dewi Rahmawati, S.Si., M.Si., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Siphon String, Production Rate, Slug, Optimize, Gas Lift Injection", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Jun 2022"}
