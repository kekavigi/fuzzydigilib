{"Nomor": 63207, "Judul": "A REVIEW OF SOFT COMPUTING APPLICATION IN MINERAL RESOURCES ENGINEERING", "Abstrak": "Soft Computing (SC) has played an important role with its automatic capability in complex new applications. In this paper a brief explanation of the advantages of SC will be given, namely tolerance to uncertainty, inaccuracy, approximate reasoning and partial truth supporting Machine Intelligence Quotient (MIQ) to achieve low cost solutions and better collaboration with conventional Hard Computing-based techniques (HC). Next was given insight insight into the four main branches of SC. Related to the SC application, review will be given to the SC application in mineral resources engineering, especially in mining engineering.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Lilik Eko Widodo": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242317", "2018 LILIK EKO WIDODO 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242318", "2018 LILIK EKO WIDODO 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242319", "2018 LILIK EKO WIDODO 1-PAPER.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242320"}, "Penulis": "Lilik Eko Widodo [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Artificial Intelligence, Soft Computing, Neural Network, Fuzzy Logic, Evolutionary Computing, Hybrid Computing, Mining Engineering", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Jan 2022"}
