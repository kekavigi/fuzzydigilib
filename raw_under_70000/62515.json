{"Nomor": 62515, "Judul": "ORIGIN, DISTRIBUTION AND IMPLICATIONS ON PRODUCTION OF BEDDING-PARALLEL FRACTURES: A CASE STUDY FROM THE CARBONIFEROUS KT-? FORMATION IN THE NT OILFIELD, PRECASPIAN BASIN, KAZAKHSTAN", "Abstrak": "Bedding-parallel fractures (BPFs) are the breakage of rocks along weakness bedding plane of stratification or\nfoliation. At present, the research of fractures is primarily focused on high-angle structural fractures (SFs), but\nfew systematic efforts have been made on the formation mechanism, distribution and influences on oil production\nof BPFs. Knowledge of attributes of BPFs in carbonate reservoirs is necessary for well-site design and\nreservoir waterflooding development.\nObservation and description of cores and image logging and laboratory measurements including cathodoluminescence\n(CL), fluid inclusion, acoustic emission experiments, porosity, permeability and well testing\ndata were used to gain insight into the formation mechanism, controlling factors and impacts on oil production of\nBPFs. The results show that the length and aperture of BPFs range from centimeters to tens of meters and from\n30 ?m to 100 ?m respectively. BPFs are primarily shear fractures without cements in the study area. There are 3\nperiods of SFs in the study area and the formation timing of BPFs and the SFs of the 2nd period are simultaneous.\nThe origin of BPFs is related to the development of thrust faults and folds. Shear BPFs were the result of interlayer\nsliding during the formation of anticline and thrusts under the effect of tectonic compaction. Extension BPFs\nformed because of the relative movement of the hanging wall and footwall of the thrust faults. Shear BPFs are\nmore common than extension BPFs because both anticline and thrusts can result in the formation of shear BPFs.\nMany factors can govern the development of BPFs including structural position, rock composition and structure,\ndistance to faults and bed thickness. The formation of BPFs is promoted by low structural position, rapid vertical\nchanges of the rock composition, small grain size, close distances to faults and thin bed thickness. Although the\naperture of low-angle BPFs is smaller than that of fractures at high angle to bedding due to the influence of\noverburden pressure, the low-angle BPFs can partially improve the reservoir permeability and partly enhance the\ninitial production of individual wells.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Changhai Li [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Lun Zhao", "Bo Liu", "Hangyu Liu", "Jianxin Li", "Zifei Fan", "Jincai Wang", "Weiqiang Li", "Wenqi Zhao", "Meng Sun"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Bedding-parallel fractures; Formation timing and origin; Controls; Impacts on oil production; Carbonate; NT Oilfield", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 196,\u00a0January 2021, 107655", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Jan 2022"}
