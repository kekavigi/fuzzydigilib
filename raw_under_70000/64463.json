{"Nomor": 64463, "Judul": "DETERMINATION OF LEAD IN LIPSTICK PRODUCTS BY ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECTROPHOTOMETRY", "Abstrak": "Lead is a chemical element from the periodic table in a carbon group with symbol Pb and having atomic number 82. Long-term exposure to lead, a naturally occurring metal used in everything from construction materials to cosmetics, can cause serious health problems such as neurotoxicity since lead can act as neurotoxin. This research was aimed to determine the concentration of lead content in lipstick samples by using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Eight samples from several countries of most common and popular brand of lipsticks were collected from different market. After the samples being collected, the wet destruction of samples were performed. It is done by 2g of sample was weighed and dissolved in deionized water and concentrated nitric acid (HNO3). The solution was then heated for 20 minutes. The samples were then analyzed by AAS method using the recommended instrument parameters ; lamp current of 5mA, wavelength of 217.0 nm and slit width of 1.0 nm. The lead standard solution was prepared by diluting it from 1000 ppm to 100 ppm and further diluted to 10 ppm. With 10 ppm standard solution was diluted again to make the concentration needed (0.2, 0.4 , 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 and 1.2 ppm). The method were validated and showed the recovery ranging from 89.61% to 114.87\u00b0A; coefficient of variance (CV) for intraday and interday of 0.042% and 0.039%, respectively; limit of detection (LOD) of 0.078 ppm and limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.082 ppm. Statistically the results obtained did not differ significantly with the acceptance value. The result showed that all of the lipstick samples contain Pb not more than acceptance of FDA which is 20 ppm.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Zetty Ellyssa Binti Sallehuddi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246918"}, "Penulis": "Zetty Ellyssa Binti Sallehuddi [10709725]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. apt.
