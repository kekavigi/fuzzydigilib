{"Nomor": 62502, "Judul": "A NOVEL APPROACH TO INVESTIGATING THE MECHANISM OF PERMEABILITY-INDUCED BOREHOLE BREATHING IN DEEPWATER SHALLOW FORMATIONS", "Abstrak": "Due to the uniqueness of deep-water shallow formations, there is no fracture system around the wellbore when\nborehole breathing is observed in this part of the formation. Therefore, the inducing mechanism of the opening/\nclosing of the fracture network cannot reasonably explain this type of borehole breathing. In this study, a new\nmechanism of permeability-induced is proposed to explain borehole breathing, based on the fact that there is no\nfracture system around the well and the formation has the characteristics of high permeability and porosity. By\nusing the stress and seepage coupling method in the porous elastic medium, a new model is established to\nsimulate and describe permeability-induced borehole breathing. Through comparison with actual cases, this\nmodel can effectively simulate the typical characteristics of fluid loss-flow back in borehole breathing. This study\nalso analyzed the influence of factors such as formation parameters and mud rheological parameters on the\nborehole breathing caused by permeability. According to the results of the study, the use of a smaller diameter\nwellbore and agents that can adjust related parameters (such as loss-reducing circulating material) can effectively\ninhibit wellbore breathing while drilling.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Reyu Gao [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Jun Li", "Hongwei Yang", "Wei Lian", "Wei Wang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Borehole breathing, Deep-water shallow formation, The mechanism of permeability-induced, Mud loss", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 208, Part A,\u00a0January 2022, 109331", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Jan 2022"}
