{"Nomor": 63665, "Judul": "LOW-FIELD NMR-RELAXOMETRY AS FAST AND SIMPLE TECHNIQUE FOR IN-SITU DETERMINATION OF SARA-COMPOSITION OF CRUDE OILS", "Abstrak": "In this study a new, fast and simple method based on low field NMR-relaxometry for in-situ determination of SARA (saturates, aromatics, resins and asphaltenes) composition of crude oils was proposed. This method was tested on 22 samples of crude oils with a wide range of SARA-composition and API gravity values (4.6\u201342.0\u00b0), including extra-heavy, heavy, medium and light crude oils. Results obtained by low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) were compared with conventional SARA analysis method (ASTM D 4124). Comparison shows good coincidence between SARA values determined by LF-NMR and conventional method data for heavy fractions of asphaltenes and resins (R2 is equal to 0.98 and 0.91, respectively) and for the sum of light fractions including saturates and aromatics (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.96). However, comparison for saturated and aromatic compounds separately gave low correlation coefficients (R2\u00a0?\u00a00.61 and 0.27, respectively) and relatively soaring standard deviation for individual correlations for saturates and aromatics (8.18 and 9.20). Consequently, LF- NMR relaxation as an alternative method for studying the composition of crude oil allows the determination of asphaltenes, resins and the sum of light fractions (saturates and aromatics) without their extraction (in-situ), which greatly simplifies and accelerates conventional chromatographic analysis. This method can be successfully applied for different types of crude oils with a wide range of API gravity and viscosity values.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Vladimir Y.
