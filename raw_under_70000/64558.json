LEAVES ON MALE WISTAR RATS", "Abstrak": "Hyperlipidemia is the condition of an increase in the amount of fats in blood. Such fats are cholesterol, cholesterol-esters, phospholipids and triglycerides. It is also identified as dyslipidemia. The rise in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and the decrease in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) will lead to atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. Many people use Moringa oleifera leaves traditionally to treat hyperlipidemic condition. Thus, the objective of this research was to evaluate the antihyperlipidemic effect of Moringa leaves ethanol extract. The research method was started with identification of plant being used. It was then followed by extraction of crude drug of Moringa oleifera leaves by using reflux apparatus with ethanol 95%. The extract was subjected for characterization. The test of antitiNpertipidentic effect in rats was started by inducing hyperlipidemic condition experimentally. Induction was done by giving food rich in high cholesterol, PTU and pure cholesterol powder orally . Upon induction, treatment was started by administrating the extract for 2 continuous weeks in 3 different doses of 7 5 ing/kg bw, 150 ing/kg bw and 300 mg/kg bw. The parameters tested were total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). The serum collected was reacted with reagents for respective lipid component. The parameters were measured using spectrophotometer. The rats were successfully induced to hyperlipidemic condition after 14 days of induction. Moringa leaves extract of 3 different doses tested (75 mg/kg bw, 150 mg/kg bw and 300 mg/kg bw) and simvastatin (25 mg/kg bw) were able to decrease the total cholesterol level significantly (p<0.05) by 47.5%, 45.4%, 47.9% and 47.3% respectively. During the induction period, total cholesterol and LDL level in rats increased by more than 50%. Meanwhile, during the administration of extract, all the test group of Moringa leaves ethanol extract as well as the reference group showed significant decrease (p<0.05) in total cholesterol, triglyceride and LDL level after 2 weeks of treatment. The HDL level increased significantly (p<0.05) after 2 weeks of treatment with Moringa leaves ethanol extract. The results obtained showed that Moringa leaves ethanol extract at doses of 75 mg/kg bw, 150 mg/kg bw and 300 mg/kg bw can he used effectively as antihyperlipidemic agent especially in decreasing total cholesterol and LDL level.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Lavannya A P Muniandy": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/247090"}, "Penulis": "Lavannya A P Muniandy [10709710]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr.Joseph Iskendiarso Sigit M..Si", "Prof. Dr. Irda Fidrianny, M.Si."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sains dan Teknologi Farmasi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Farmasi", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Mei 2022"}
