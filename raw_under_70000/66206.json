{"Nomor": 66206, "Judul": "SIMULATION OF INJECTIVITY DECLINE ON WATER INJECTION WELL: IMPACT OF VARIOUS SUSPENDED SOLIDS ON WATER INJECTION QUALITY", "Abstrak": "This study analyzes the concerns linked to the quality of the injection water used in the water flooding method. The injection water quality is a significant consideration in preventing blockage of the inflow area surrounding the wellbore. Blocking the inflow area produces an increase in pressure drop in the filter cake area, which will continually cause a decrease in injectivity. Under certain conditions, the formation cannot bear pressure, resulting in fracturing. Reservoir simulation was carried out by modeling the permeability and porosity of the filter cake determined by the filter cake compression test. Simulations were done with the sensitivity of permeability matrix, type of suspended solids, and concentration of suspended solids. The simulation results consist of the relation of suspended solid concentration to the injectivity decline, the relation of the types of suspended solids in the injectivity decline, and the estimated maximum concentration of suspended solid contained in water injection before fracturing occurs.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Fahriza Dian Mahendra": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250731"}, "Penulis": "Fahriza Dian Mahendra [12218045]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
