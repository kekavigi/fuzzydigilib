{"Nomor": 62578, "Judul": "EFFECT OF WATER SALINITY ON OIL/BRINE INTERFACIAL BEHAVIOUR DURING LOW SALINITY WATERFLOODING: A MECHANISTIC STUDY", "Abstrak": "In recent years, controlling the salinity and composition of the injected water has become an emerging enhanced\noil recovery (EOR) technique, often described as low salinity (LS) waterflooding. This work is done with the\nintention to contribute to the ongoing discussions about LS waterflooding mechanism(s). For this purpose, a\nseries of different experiments were conducted. At first, the effect of salinity on the interfacial tension (IFT) and\nthe contact angle was evaluated with a crude oil sample. Then to achieve more accurate results in observing oil/\nwater interface, similar IFT experiments were also carried out on a synthetic oil containing asphaltenes.\nThereafter, microscopic visualization using glass micromodel was performed on the interface of the synthetic oil\nsample and brines. Four brine solutions including Sea Water (SW), it's dilutions and formation water (FW) were\nused for various experiments. Finally, to investigate the presented mechanism by other authors, a series of\nEnvironmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) analysis on the synthetic oil was carried out to understand\nbetter the phase behaviour after contacting both synthetic oil and water phases from the micromodel experiment.\nBased on the existing mechanism, there exists an optimal concentration beyond which dilution is no\nlonger an effective process.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "PEYMAN ROSTAMI [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mohammad Fattahi Mehraban", "Mohammad Sharifi", "Morteza Dejam", "Shahab Ayatollahi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Water salinity, Wettability, Interfacial tension, Oil/brine interface, Low salinity waterflooding", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 5, Issue 4, Pages 367-374 (December 2019), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2019.03.005", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Jan 2022"}
