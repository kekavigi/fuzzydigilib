The\nemergence of the latest technology, such as CCS (carbon capture and storage), is considered capable of dealing\nwith these problems. CCS is a technology where the CO2 will be captured and stored for an extended period in a\nselected reservoir. The selection of CO2 storage has several considerations that must be taken into account, such\nas the capacity of CO2 storage. A depleted gas reservoir is one of the suitable types of reservoir for storing CO2.\nHowever, this kind of reservoir can trigger subsidence.\nThis study will be devoted to estimating the CO2 storage capacity in a subsidence-depleted gas reservoir. The\ncalculation of the CO2 storage is carried out by using the p/z method from the material balance equation (MBE).\nThe calculation used two approaches, which are the estimation of CO2 storage capacity by derived MBE (Tseng\net al., 2012) and commercial software (IPM-MBAL). The results of the CO2 storage estimation by derived MBE\nfrom Tseng et al. (2012) is 0.021 Gt, and IPM-MBAL software is 0.014 Gt with the initial gas in place (IGIP)\n225 BSCF.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Syarah": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250878"}, "Penulis": "Syarah [12218091]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Dedy Irawan, S.T., M.T.", "Pahala Dominicus Sinurat, S.T., M.Sc."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "CCS, CO2 storage, p/z, initial gas in place (IGIP), abnormally pressured", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Jun 2022"}
