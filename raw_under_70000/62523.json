Pore spaces\nin shales consist of three major types: interparticle pores and intraparticle pores associated with mineral matrix\nand organic-matter pores. In this study, the evolution of pore networks for each pore type in lacustrine shales\nduring thermal maturation was studied based on a suite of 19 Triassic Yanchang Formation shale samples from\nthe Ordos Basin across a maturation gradient from immature to late mature (vitrinite reflectance (Ro) from 0.36\nto 1.30%). The results show that different pore types follow systematic evolutions during thermal maturation and\nthat the evolution of pore type and pore size is critically controlled by multiple diagenetic processes such as\nmechanical compaction, cementation, mineral dissolution, clay mineral transformation, and organic matter\nthermal maturation. Specifically, at immature and early mature stages (Ro < 0.55%), pores associated with\nmineral matrix are abundant and have moderate pore sizes. Interparticle pores exhibit preferential orientation\nalong clay platelets. At the mature stage (0.55% < Ro < 1.15%), pores associated with mineral matrix have the\nsmallest size, and interparticle pores become less common and show reduced preferential orientation because of\nmechanical compaction and cementation. Organic-matter pores start to develop at a maturity level of Ro 0.77%\nand higher. The total porosity and BET specific surface area show minimum values at Ro 1.12%, mainly because\npre-existing matrix-related pores are destroyed by mechanical compaction and filled by migrated bitumen and\nliquid hydrocarbons, and then they increase when Ro exceeds 1.12%, which likely results from the development\nof secondary organic-matter nanopores due to the generation and expulsion of gaseous hydrocarbons. An increase\nin pore size of matrix-related pores at the late mature stage (1.15% < Ro < 1.30%) could be a result of\ndissolution by organic acid generated during organic matter thermal maturation.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Juan Teng [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hucheng Deng", "Bei Liu", "Wenling Chen", "Meiyan Fu", "Yu Xia", "Hanze Yu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "pore evolution; pore size distribution; organic-matter pores; thermal maturation; lacustrine shale; Ordos Basin", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 196,\u00a0January 2021, 107631", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Jan 2022"}
