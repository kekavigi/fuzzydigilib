{"Nomor": 62735, "Judul": "AN INVESTIGATION ON SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS AND PERFORMANCE PREDICTION OF PROFILE CONTROL BY CLAY PARTICLES FOR POLYMER FLOODED RESERVOIR", "Abstrak": "The use of residual polymer in the formation after polymer ?ooding for deep injection-pro?le control is an important method to further improve oil recovery. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of pro?le control by clay particles after polymer ?ooding, 5 in?uential factors were selected to perform the numerical simulation, including the permeability ratio, formation oil viscosity, injection timing, injection volume and injection con-centration of clay particles solution. The results show that, with the increase of such factors as permeability ratio and formation oil viscosity, the recovery increment of the pro?le control increases ?rst and then decreases; the earlier the clay particle solution is injected, the better the development effect; the larger the injection volume and injection concentration of clay particles solution, the larger the recovery increment of the pro?le control. After that, Response Surface Methodology was used to conduct the performance prediction and parameters optimi-zation. Firstly, the Box-Behnken model with three levels was adopted to perform the experiment design. Then, two predictive models of ultimate recovery and recovery increment of the pro?le control were established on the basis of the multiple regression analysis, which agrees well with the numerical simulation results. Finally, the optimal level of each in?uential factor was determined by response surface method.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Angang Zhang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Zifei Fan", "Lun Zhao", "Congge He"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Clay particles; Residual polymer; Profile control; Performance prediction; Optimization", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 196, January 2021, 107690, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0920410520307555", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "18 Jan 2022"}
