{"Nomor": 69330, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT OF IOS-BASED LEARNING MANAGEMENT  SYSTEM EDUNEX MOBILE APPLICATIONS", "Abstrak": "People's habits in using social media communication technology such as, WhatsApp,\nInstagram, Facebook, and others can be used as guidelines for designing online\nlearning. One of the innovations in the learning system by utilizing technology\ncommunication that is Edunex. Edunex is a Learning Management System that\ndeveloped by the Directorate of Education Development of ITB and can be accessed\nthrough the website www.edunex.itb.ac.id. However, according to Bernacki,\naccessibility on the website platform is lower than on the mobile platform. This\ncauses the features provided by the Edunex are not accessed and used maximally.\nTherefore we need the Edunex mobile application to improve accessibility on Edunex.\n\nThe Edunex mobile app is built with a native paradigm because paradigm native\nprovides better user convenience compared to hybrids. Applications that are the result\nof research assignments is an iOS-based mobile application that is built using a\nframework SwiftUI and UIKit work. Students will be provided with features such as\nmessages, exams, attendance, CRS, notifications, and viewing materials.Data\ndisplayed and processed on each feature of the Edunex mobile application will be the\nsame as that on the site because it is integrated with the Edunex site server.\n\nAfter performing performance testing on the Edunex mobile application based on iOS\nby utilizing Sentry tools, the application is considered successful by achieving pretty\ngood satisfaction. So that the application is considered capable of providing good user\n\ncomfort by providing excellent performance satisfying. The performance tested on the\napplication is the total crashes in the application, Apdex, failure percentage, and others.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Fatkhan Masruri [13518053]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Yusep Rosmansyah, S.T., M.Sc., Ph.D.", "Dicky Prima Satya, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Informatika", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Teknik Elektro dan Informatika", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "learning management system, Edunex, native paradigm, iOS", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Dessy Rondang Monaomi", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Sep 2022"}
