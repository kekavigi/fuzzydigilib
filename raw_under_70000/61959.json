{"Nomor": 61959, "Judul": "A REVIEW OF RUTIN EXTRACTION FROM CASSAVA LEAVES (MANIHOT ESCULENTA) AND ITS SUN  PROTECTION FACTOR EFFECTIVITY FORMULATED IN CREAM PRODUCTS", "Abstrak": "Manihot esculenta also known as cassava have leaves which are notable for producing flavonoid \nrutin where it is a flavonol glycoside which has the ability to protect plants from dangerous UV \nradiations. The technique of rutin extraction varies from traditional extraction to improved \nmodernized extractions which utilizes integrated instruments such as supercritical fluid extraction \n(SFE), microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), ultrasound assisted extraction (UAE), and pressurized \nliquid extraction (PLE). The aim of this literature study is to compare the extractions for plant-based \nrutin and to compare the best method of extraction used in order to obtain a high yield of rutin \nfrom cassava leaves and its sun protection factor (SPF) effectiveness when formulated in a cream \nproduct. This research is done by applying the Meta-analysis Systematic Review where data from \nrelevant documents are collected mainly from Google scholar, Sciencedirect and PubMed which is \nthen analyzed to draw a specific conclusion. Rutin from cassava leaves is best extracted using UAE \nwith the highest yield obtained around 622 mg/100 g dry extract proved by Tao et al. Moreover, \nMAE is also a good substitution for obtaining high yield of rutin as proved by Chahyadi and Elfahmi \nwhere rutin is obtained around 23.37g. Rutin is one of the widely known flavonoids where it is an \neffective and non-toxic compound which can be used for sunscreen. The SPF properties of some \nmedicinal plants such as D. moldavica and V. tricolor contains high amounts of phenolic and \nflavonoids with the highest SPF value of 24.79 and 25.69 respectively compared to other plants. \nHigh flavonoid content can result in UVB protection. In addition to that, rutin when formulated in \na cream showed an increase of around 70% in the SPF effectivity compared to that without rutin. \nTherefore, based on the several studies reviewed, cassava leaves are composed of high level of \nrutin where it can be extracted using MAE or UAE for maximum yield and due to its relatively high \nsun protection factor (spf) activity, it has potential to be formulated in a multifunctional sunscreen \nor cream.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Salsabila Maisyah": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/237114"}, "Penulis": "Salsabila Maisyah [10717209]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Elfahmi, S.Si., M.Si."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sains dan Teknologi Farmasi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Farmasi", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Cassava or Manihot esculenta, rutin extraction, Sun Protection Factor (SPF), cream or  sunscreen.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Sep 2021"}
