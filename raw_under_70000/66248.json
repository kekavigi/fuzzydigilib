{"Nomor": 66248, "Judul": "EXPERIMENTAL STUDY: ANIONIC-ZWITTERIONIC SURFACTANT MIXTURE FOR CHEMICAL ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY", "Abstrak": "Surfactant flooding has been known to increase the ultimate recovery factor by reducing interfacial tension (IFT) between water and crude oil. To achieve the expected result, surfactant solution must be selected and formulated properly, usually based on IFT measurement and phase behavior test. Determination of the interfacial tension can be done by using a spinning-drop tensiometer. However, the procedure for using a spinning-drop tensiometer is expensive and time-consuming when it is used to measure IFT at various salinities and various surfactant candidates. Surfactant screening before determining IFT with a spinning-drop tensiometer is one option that can be done because the number of surfactant candidates can be reduced, and the optimum salinity range can be obtained. In this study, there are several types of anionic and zwitterionic surfactant mixtures that will be screened first to see which surfactant mixture is indicated to be the best for IFT measurement using a spinning-drop tensiometer. The selection of the surfactant mixture was carried out based on the aqueous stability test and the phase behavior test. This study aimed to know the performance and the effect of the addition of zwitterionic surfactant into anionic surfactant solution based on an aqueous stability test, phase behavior test, and interfacial tension (IFT) measurement. It was found that the addition of zwitterionic surfactant to anionic surfactant has good synergy and helps in reducing IFT. And from these results, it was found that the anionic and zwitterionic surfactant solution chosen because it was indicated to have the best performance was a mixture of AR-M/MA-AO14 surfactant solution which was able to produce an IFT value of 2.44 \u00d7 10-3 mN/m. And from this study, the results show that a mixture of anionic & zwitterionic surfactants can provide an alternative approach towards optimization of chemical EOR processes.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Michael Arya Yutaka": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250790"}, "Penulis": "Michael Arya Yutaka [12218095]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
