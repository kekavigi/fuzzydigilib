{"Nomor": 62302, "Judul": "ECONOMIC VALUATION OF MINING PROJECT USING FUZZY REAL OPTION METHOD: CASE STUDY OF UNDERGROUND GOLD MINE", "Abstrak": "Mining is a risky business due to many uncertainties of geology, technic, economic, environment, and social aspects. For technical aspect, its uncertainty could be reduced by further or detail study. But for economic aspect, in this case commodity price, the uncertainty could be managed by adopting financial option theory. In financial option theory, mining project is evaluated using the concept of stock market which option holder has a right to choose whether they sell the option in strike price or wait and sell the option in the maturity time. Financial option theory combined with concept of furry logic called as fuzzy real option. This paper will apply fuzzy real option method for valuing underground gold mine project. Traditional discounted cash flow method applied for 11-month production period preceded by 18-month of development period produced negative Net Present Value (NPV). However, valuation using fuzzy real option method by considering 22 month of delay time will produce positive NPV.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Fadhila Achmadi Rosyid": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/239885", "2019 FADHILA ACHMADI ROSYID 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/239886", "2019 FADHILA ACHMADI ROSYID 1-TABLE OF CONTENTS.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/239887", "2019 FADHILA ACHMADI ROSYID 1-PAPER.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/239888"}, "Penulis": "Fadhila Achmadi Rosyid [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Arjo Prawoto Wibowo, Sari Uly Sibarani, Lilik Eko Widodo, Mohamad Nur Heriawan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "fuzzy real option, Net Present Value, Gold mine", "Sumber": "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342874874_Economic_Valuation_of_Mining_Project_Using_ Fuzzy_Real_Option_Method_Case_Study_of_Underground_Gold_Mine", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani \u00a0\n                                     Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Des 2021"}
