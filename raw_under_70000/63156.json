{"Nomor": 63156, "Judul": "A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE APPLICATION OF NANO-SILICA IN OIL WELL CEMENTING", "Abstrak": "Oil and Gas Industry is a Multi-Billion Dollar Industry. Drilling a well is costly, right from exploration to drilling and production to Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). Nanotechnology has the potential to introduce revolutionary changes in several areas of the oil and gas industry, such as exploration, drilling, cementation, production, EOR, etc. Use of Nanotechnology in the cement slurry can also achieve solutions to some of the problems pertaining to oil well cementation. Nano-silica is a better alternative compared to conventional additives like calcium chloride and silica, because as compared to calcium chloride and silica, the amount of nano-silica to be added is very small. Nano-silica acts as a multi-functional additive. Upon addition of nano-silica to cement slurry, there is a decrease in the thickening time, an increase in the compressive strength, decrease in porosity and permeability within the cement and also a decrease in the fluid loss. Incorporation of nano-silica ensures proper cementation and greater integrity of the well. Nano-silica helps in decreasing the wait on cement (WOC) time and therefore reduces the overall capital cost. Nano-silica is highly recommended for deep offshore wells where high temperature and high pressure are often encountered. This paper discusses the behavior of Nano-silica at high temperatures and also reviews effects of Nano-silica on various properties of cement.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Akshar Thakkar [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Aakash Raval", "Shishir Chandra", "Manan Shah", "Anirbid Sircar"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Oil well cementing; Nano-silica; Thickening time; Compressive strength", "Sumber": "Petroleum, Volume 6, Issue 2, 2020, Pages 123-129, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S240565611830155X", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Jan 2022"}
