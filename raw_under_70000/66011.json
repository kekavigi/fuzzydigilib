{"Nomor": 66011, "Judul": "MULTIDISCIPLINARY OPTIMIZATION OF THIN-WALLED BEAM FOR AIRCRAFT SUBFLOOR STRUCTURE UNDER OBLIQUE LOADING", "Abstrak": "Airplanes are the safest means of transportation, but regardless of that, the fatality rate per accident is still considerably high. Therefore, an improvement in structure safety is one way to answer this problem. This research aims to increase the crashworthiness performance of aircraft subfloor structures while also maintaining a minimum weight. This groundwork focuses on improving the specific energy absorption of the subfloor structure which is a thin-walled beam construction. The baseline model uses a sine-wave beam configuration to reduce the peak acceleration during a grounding impact accident. Then, the Taguchi optimization method is performed by varying the sine-wave shape parameters and material. The shape parameters are amplitude, wavelength, and thickness while the material variation is aluminum alloy. There are 4 control factors with 3 level variations, which results in L9 Taguchi orthogonal array for the optimization process. Each array defined a unique configuration of the sine-wave beam based on Taguchi\u2019s orthogonal array. The crushing simulation of the sine-wave beam used an oblique impactor with a 15\u00b0 tilt and an initial velocity of 9 m/s. Data obtained from the simulation are then processed to bring out the axial and lateral SEA (specific energy absorption). Finally, the multidisciplinary optimization is performed to find the best combination of axial and lateral SEA based on the objective function which is composed of weight criteria and the normalized value of each discipline. The best objective function resulted in the optimum multidiscipline configuration of the sine-wave beam which had a total of 16.98 % improvement compared to the initial model.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Rheza Andrianto": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250423"}, "Penulis": "Rheza Andrianto [13618018]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
