{"Nomor": 69042, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION OF A GEL FORMULATION CONTAINING GOLDEN CHERRY EXOSOMES (PHYSALIS MINIMA) AS A POTENTIAL ANTI-PHOTOAGING", "Abstrak": "Plant-derived exosome-like nanoparticles (PDENs) are nano-sized vesicles containing biomolecules\nthat are released by multivesicular bodies. Recently, studies have shown the efficacy of exosomes\nin treating photoaging, through increasing collagen synthesis and decreasing collagen degradation.\nIn addition to that, some PDENs were also proven to contain bioactive metabolites, which also have\npotential antioxidant activity to mitigate the risk of photoaging. Thus, this present study aims to\nproduce a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of photoaging by formulating and\ndeveloping a gel and incorporating it with exosomes derived from golden cherry (Physalis minima).\nThe formulation was developed by first preparing various base formulations with different\ncompositions, and selecting the best through evaluation test. The results obtained showed only\npolymer base natrosol with concentration of 0.25% were suitable for the incorporation of\nexosomes. The selected base was then incorporated with various concentrations of golden cherry\nexosomes, and was evaluated regarding its physical and stability profile. The result demonstrates\nthat the incorporated gel not only displayed pleasant organoleptic properties, but also shows a pH\ncompatible with skin, with pseudoplastic flow, and a suitable viscosity for topical application. The\nstability study also only revealed minor changes in viscosity and pH, without affecting the general\nstability of the formulation. Formulation incorporating 0.25% golden cherry exosomes, had shown\nthe best stability profile compare to other concentrations. On characterization, although the\nincorporated exosomes showed heterogeneous particle size distribution (PI > 0.3), they still\nmaintained their structural integrity. In addition to that, immunological assay on incorporated\nexosomes incubated with human dermal fibroblast had showed an increase in type 1 collagen\nexpression. In conclusion, golden cherry exosomes had been successfully incorporated into gel and\nthus, can be potentially utilized as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of photoaging.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Vincent Evan Setiadi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/261370"}, "Penulis": "Vincent Evan Setiadi [10718205]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. apt.
