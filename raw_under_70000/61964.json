{"Nomor": 61964, "Judul": "REVIEW ON WOUND-HEALING ACTIVITIES OF MADECASSOSIDE ISOLATED FROM CENTELLA  ASIATICA AS TOPICAL FORMULATIONS", "Abstrak": "C. asiatica is perennial herb commonly found in tropical areas and have been widely used to treat \nconditions such as leprosy, hysteria and epilepsy and is known to have diuretic, antipyretic, \nantibacterial and anticancer effects. C. asiatica have also shown to treat dermatological issues such as \ntreating burn wounds or incisional and excisional wounds. Extract of C. asiatica have been reported to \ncontain triterpenoids such as asiaticoside, madecassoside, asiatic acid and madecassic acid in which \nthese phytochemicals have also been known to be the most medically useful. In this literature review, \nresearch articles pertaining to the topical use of C. asiatica for wound healing as well as research articles \nregarding the effect of madecassoside for wound healing were carefully reviewed. The keywords used \nfor searching the articles include Centella, madecassoside, wound and topical such that all of them are \nused in combination together and results include articles within the publication years from 2006 to \n2021 from Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Hindawi and Semantic Scholar. This excludes literature that \nfocuses on non-topical, non-C. asiatica and non-wound healing topics. Meanwhile other additional \ninformation regarding the main topic is searched accordingly to the topic and kept set between the \nyears 2006 to 2021, however, certain literatures outside the time range but with clearer information is \nalso taken into consideration. Multiple scientific studies have shown the positive effect of \nmadecassoside applied topically on burn wounds as well as incisional wounds, generally through the \npromotion of angiogenesis as well as epithelialization during wound-healing process . However, the \nmajority of scientific articles detailing the effect of C. asiatica extract as well as the extracts\u2019 made into \na topical formulation provides information that effects are also due to asiaticoside too, therefore it is \nhard to determine just madecassoside\u2019s effect. Moreover, since madecassoside is also very close In \npolarity to asiaticoside, it is generally requires effort to separate them. To conclude, madecassoside is \nproven to be beneficial for wound healing activity, shown by the topical applications of it just as an \nextract on its own, or formulated into creams, sprays or hydrogels; however, there certainly needs to be more studies to be conducted to analyze whether the wound healing effect of madecassoside itself \nis better than asiaticosides and its aglycones or not and for now, the combination of madecassoside \nand other centellosides might be more reasonable to aid wound-healing.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Nuril Aisyah Auliani": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/237118"}, "Penulis": "Nuril Aisyah Auliani [10717205]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Elfahmi, S.Si., M.Si."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sains dan Teknologi Farmasi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Farmasi", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Madecassoside, centella, wound, topical", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Sep 2021"}
