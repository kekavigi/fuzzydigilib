{"Nomor": 64789, "Judul": "ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY, TOTAL PHENOLIC, FLAVONOID, CAROTENOID FROM VARIOUS EXTRACTS OF WHITE GUAVA (PSIDIUM GUAJAVA L.) LEAVES AND ISOLATION OF ANTIOXIDANT COMPOUND", "Abstrak": "Guava (P.s'idium guajava L.) are well known plant and widely planted in Malaysia and Indonesia. It has many uses such as leaves extract was found to possess antidiarrhea, antimicrobial, hepatoprotective and antioxidant activities. This research aim to determine antioxidant capacity from various extracts of white guava leaves using DPPH assay, IC50 of DPPH scavenging activity, phenolic total, flavonoid total, carotenoid total of each extracts, analyze correlation of phenolic total, flavonoid total, carotenoid total and DPPH scavenging capacity and isolation of antioxidant compound from white guava leaves extract. The crude drug of white guava leaves was extracted using reflux apparatus with three different solvents, n-hexane, ethyl acetate and ethanol. For each extracts were performed monitoring extracts by TLC (thin layer chromatography), antioxidant activity test by using DPPH (2,2-dipheny1-1-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging method and IC50 of DPPH scavenging capacity. Phenolic total, flavonoid total and carotenoid total content of the extracts were also measured. Ethyl acetate extract was fractionated using vacuum liquid chromatography. Purification was conducted using TLC preparative. Purity test of subtraction was done by TLC single development with three different mobile phase. Antioxidant compound was characterized by specific spray reagents, ultraviolet- visible spectrophotometry and two dimensional paper chromatography. Crude drug of white guava leaves contained flavonoid, tannin, quinone, saponin, terpenoid and steroid/triterpenoid. Ethyl acetate extract of of white guava leaves (with density 1% extract 0.89 g/mL) demonstrated the highest DPPH scavenging activity (93.15%), with 1050 of DPPH scavenging capacity 6.03 ppm, phenolic total 3.02 g GAE/100 g, flavonoid total 10.3 g QE/100 g and carotenoid total 2.32 g BET/100 g. DPPH scavenging capacity of ethyl acetate extract of white guava leaves 93.15 % significantly different with ethanolic extract 15.93 % and n-hexane extract 34.75 \u00b0A (p<0.05). Total flavonoid of ethyl acetate extract had positively high correlation with DPPH scavenging activity, while total phenolic and total carotenoid content had negative con-elation with DPPH scavenging activity. Antioxidant compound J was isolated from ethyl acetate extract. Ethyl acetate extract has highest antioxidant activity and significantly different with ethanolic extract and n-hexane extract. Flavonoid was the main contributor in antioxidant activities of ethyl acetate guava leaves extract. Antioxidant compound J that was isolated from ethyl acetate extract was supposed to be tlavones aglycone that had free OH in C7 and no free OH in C3 and C5.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Jayashree D O Thinagaran": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/248115"}, "Penulis": "Jayashree D O Thinagaran [10709708]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Irda Fidrianny, M.Si.", "Prof. Dr. Sukrasno, M.S."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sains dan Teknologi Farmasi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Farmasi", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Jun 2022"}
