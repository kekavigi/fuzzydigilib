{"Nomor": 62455, "Judul": "SPATIAL RELATIONS BETWEEN GOLD, ASSOCIATED METALS AND LITHOLOGIES AT THE MIWAH ACID-SULFATE (HIGH SULFIDATION) EPITHERMAL DEPOSIT, ACEH, NORTH SUMATRA, INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "The tabular Miwah acid-sulphate epithermal gold deposit occurs within a prominent peak dominated by a vuggy silica +/- sulphide +/- alunite core that grades into\nperipheral argillic and propylitic zones. These altered rocks replaced phreatomagmatic diatreme breccia, other breccias, and andesite. Gold is spatially correlated with Ag,\nCu, As and Sb in the mineralized vuggy silica and massive sulphide-silica zones, and negatively with Pb and Zn. A multivariate statistical analysis shows that for surface\nsamples, the mean of Au in the silica and undifferentiated breccia domains, is 1.97 ppm and 1.06 ppm, respectively, and the spatial range of Au span 200 - 350 m laterally. In\ndrill core the mean of Au is 0.94 ppm in silica rocks, 1.06 ppm in hydrothermal breccias and 2.07 ppm in undifferentiated breccias, and the spatial range of Au vary from 150 - 300 m laterally and 10 - 20 m vertically. On the basis of these metal associations, lithologic units and geology, the Miwah gold deposit is structurally controlled by fracture zones through which the mineralizing vapors or brines ascended from a hydrothermal system at some depth in a maar-diatreme volcano. These brines flowed laterally along vug-enhanced permeable host rocks to develop the tabular deposit.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Mohamad Nur Heriawan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240331", "2017 MOHAMAD NUR HERIAWAN 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240332", "2017 MOHAMAD NUR HERIAWAN 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240333", "2017 MOHAMAD NUR HERIAWAN 1-PAPER.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240349"}, "Penulis": "Mohamad Nur Heriawan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Thom as Mulja"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Miwah acid-sulfate, gold, phreatomagmatic", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Jan 2022"}
