{"Nomor": 64755, "Judul": "APPLICATION OF INPUT-OUTPUT HYBRID FOR ESTIMATING ELECTRICITY DEMAND IN THE PROVINCE OF SOUTH KALIMANTAN", "Abstrak": "Fulfillment of electricity is one of the problems that exist in the province of South Kalimantan. The government's plan through PT PLN in dealing with this problem is to plan the construction of power generation units. The electricity demand is forecasted based on final demand, which is influenced by GRDP growth and household electricity consumption. Projected GRDP growth is done in two scenarios: I) based on time series forecasting, and 2) based on the Master Plan for the Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesian Economic Development (MP3El). Projected demand for electricity is calculated using a model of Input-Output Hybrid. Based on the model.for scenario I, the demand for electricity in 2022 amounted to 4,037 GWh with an average growth o/8.98% per year and electrification ratio of 84%. For scenario 2, the demand for electricity in 2022 amounted to 5,381 G Wh, with an average growth of I 0.4% per year and electrification ratio of approximately 100%.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Aryo Prawoto Wibowo": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/247960", "2016 ARYO PRAWOTO WIBOWO 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/247961", "2016 ARYO PRAWOTO WIBOWO 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/247963", "2016 ARYO PRAWOTO WIBOWO 1-PAPER.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/247964"}, "Penulis": "Aryo Prawoto Wibowo [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Karina Shella Putri"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "GRDP; household electricity consumption; I/O Hibryd.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "07 Jun 2022"}
