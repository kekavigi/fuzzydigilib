{"Nomor": 62541, "Judul": "CRITICAL PARAMETERS OF THE JAMIN EFFECT IN A CAPILLARY TUBE WITH A CONTRACTED CROSS SECTION", "Abstrak": "The Jamin effect acting as a flow resistance induced by bubbles or droplets, plays a critical role in the recovery of\noils by water flooding, which is caused by the hysteresis of contact angle and contraction of capillary tube. In this\nstudy, we performed a comprehensive investigation on the mechanism of Jamin effect. The whole process of a\nbubble passing through the capillary tube is probed, where the bubble morphology and velocity based on the\nexperiment and numerical simulation agree very well. The numerical result shows that, only the driving pressure\nexceeds the critical value, can the Jamin effect be overcome; and otherwise, the bubble would be pinned at the\ncontraction. The dimensional analysis gives the relationship between the critical pressure and various parameters\nin the system. Finally, several simple and convenient empirical formulas are presented, which are very useful in\nsome engineering areas. These findings can strengthen our understanding on the Jamin effect, and provide some\ninspirations for exploiting oils and gases with high efficiency.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Sai Liu [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Xiaoxiao Dou", "Qingdong Zeng", "Jianlin Liu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Jamin effect; Capillary tube; Cross section contraction; Critical pressure; Bubble deformation; Dimensional analysis", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 196, 2021, 107635, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920410520307026", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Jan 2022"}
