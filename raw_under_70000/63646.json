Five cases comprising 25 core-flood experiments under different experimental conditions using Indiana limestone cores were carried out at various injection rates to obtain the optimum injection rates. From the results, the optimum injection rates tended to increase with permeability but was not related to acid concentrations. The pore volume to breakthrough (PVBT), the amount of acid consumption required to breakthrough, was lower at higher permeability and acid concentration. This means that less amount of acid is consumed to generate the wormholes. Wormhole visualization with X-ray CT imaging showed that the wormhole diameters were gradually reduced along with the wormhole propagation axis in all cases. In addition, the mean of wormhole diameter tended to increase according to the higher permeability and acid concentration. The tortuosity, which is the ratio of actual wormhole length to core length, was exceeded at least 1.35 in each case. This implies that the actual flow length of the optimum wormhole is much longer than the core length. However, previous studies of wormhole propagation regarding the configuration of optimum wormhole are sparse, more intensive research would be required. Therefore, these propagation characteristics of optimum wormholes should be considered to improve the wormhole prediction model, and the wormhole prediction results would be more accurate and realistic than those of the existing models. Further study is needed to develop a new wormhole prediction model considering the propagation characteristics, such as diameter reduction and actual flow length.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hyunsang Yoo [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Youngmin Kim", "Hochang Jang", "Jeonghwan Lee"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Matrix acidizing; Carbonate rock; Micro X-ray CT; Optimum wormhole; Propagation characteristics", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 196, 2021, 108010, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920410520310652", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Feb 2022"}
