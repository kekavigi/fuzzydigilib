{"Nomor": 62577, "Judul": "A MULTIOBJECTIVE DOMINANCE AND DECOMPOSITION ALGORITHM FOR RESERVOIR MODEL HISTORY MATCHING", "Abstrak": "Reservoir model history matching is a multiobjective optimization problem. It involves the adjustment of relevant\nreservoir model input parameters, to minimize the mismatch between simulated and observed reservoir\nresponses and to obtain a diverse set of geologically plausible reservoir simulation models. Typically, single\nobjective optimization methods are adopted during history matching. This requires weighted sum scalarization.\nHowever, scalarization biases the optimization search, limiting the diversity of the recovered solutions. In this\nwork, a computer assisted history matching procedure based on transform parameterization and a multiobjective\nevolutionary algorithm with dominance and decomposition (MOEA/DD) is proposed. In the procedure, history\nmatching is treated as a multiobjective optimization problem, parameterized in terms of a small number of\nkernel principal component analysis (KPCA) variables. KPCA provides efficient parameterization of the reservoir\nmodel input property fields. Concurrently, MOEA/DD provides robust and unbiased optimization over multiple\nobjectives. The effectiveness of the proposed procedure is demonstrated with the UNISIM-I-H history matching\nbenchmark problem.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "OSHO ILAMAH [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Multiobjective, History matching, Parameterization, Decomposition, MOEA/DD", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 5, Issue 4, Pages 352-366 (December 2019), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2019.07.004", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Jan 2022"}
