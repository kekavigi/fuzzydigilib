{"Nomor": 63157, "Judul": "CHARACTERISTICS AND MECHANISM OF UPPER PERMIAN REEF RESERVOIRS IN THE EASTERN LONGGANG AREA, NORTHEASTERN SICHUAN BASIN, CHINA", "Abstrak": "As a typical kind of lithologic reservoirs, reef reservoirs are generally featured by their large single-well reservoir thickness, good reservoir physical properties, and high gas well productivity. The Upper Permian Changxing Formation is an important natural gas exploration target in the Sichuan Basin, which hosts a large reef gas reservoir and is mainly distributed along the Kaijiang-Liangping Trough. Comprehensive analyses are implemented to investigate reservoir characteristics and identify controlling factors of reef reservoirs in Changxing Formation in the Eastern Longgang Area, Northeastern Sichuan Basin, including core, logging, and seismic data analyses. Changxing Formation reservoirs in the study area mainly occur in the reef-shoal complex, which are featured by wide distribution, large thickness and generally good physical properties. Reservoir rocks are dominantly composed of bioclastic dolomite and silty-fine dolomite (with grain phantom structure), while the main reservoir space consists of residual intergranular pores, intergranular dissolution pores, and karst vugs. In the seismic profiles, typical mound-shaped chaotic reflections can be clearly seen. It is suggested by the main reservoir development controlling factor analysis that the distributions of reef reservoirs are typically controlled by sedimentary facies belts, while the scale of the reef-shoal complex is determined by the pene-sedimentary micro-paleo-geomorphology. Dolomitization can not only significantly preserve the primary pores but also enhance the permeability of rocks. Moreover, karstification is the key to high-quality reef-shoal reservoirs.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Lei Tan [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Hong Liu", "Yuzhe Tang", "Bing Luo", "Ya Zhang", "Yuran Yang", "Yisha Liao", "Weifeng Du", "Xiran Yang"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Changxing formation; Reef; Reservoir characteristics; Essential factors; Eastern longgang", "Sumber": "Petroleum, Volume 6, Issue 2, 2020, Pages 130-137, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405656118301470", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Jan 2022"}
