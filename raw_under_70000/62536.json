{"Nomor": 62536, "Judul": "SIMULATION OF FLUID FLOW THROUGH REAL MICROANNULI GEOMETRIES", "Abstrak": "Debonding of well cement towards casing or rock, i.e. microannuli formation, is a typical failure mode of cement\nbarriers. Consequently, such microannuli may act as leak paths during leakages of downhole fluids such as\nhydrocarbons or CO2. Current leakage models usually assume that microannuli have uniform geometries with\nhomogeneous apertures, which results in linear Darcy flow. However, several recent studies have shown that\nmicroannuli do not have uniform geometries and subsequently, fluid flow through real microannuli is complex\nand non-linear.\nThis paper presents results of CFD simulations of fluid flow through real microannuli geometries, where the\nmicroannuli were experimentally created and visualized in 3D by X-ray computed tomography (CT). Simulations\nwere performed with three different fluids of varying viscosity and density \u2013 methane gas, liquid water, and\nliquid oil. The results visualize how the non-uniform flow path geometry and surface roughness of real microannuli\ncreate tortuous flow patterns, especially locally around bottlenecks and other heterogeneities. It is also\nseen that these complex flow patterns result in non-linear dependencies between flow rate and pressure difference\nfor the less viscous fluids, i.e. gas and water, whereas the more viscous oil display linear flow.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Anisa Noor Corina [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ragnhild Skorpa", "Sigbj\u00f8rn Sangesland", "Torbj\u00f8rn Vr\u00e5lstad"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Cement microannuli; Computational fluid dynamics (CFD); Non-linear fluid flow", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 196,\u00a0January 2021, 107669, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920410520307361", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Jan 2022"}
