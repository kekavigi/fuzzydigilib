Using a shale core from Malaysian formation, laboratory experiments were conducted to extend the scope of available data for CO2/brine interfacial tension (IFT) and contact angles of shale/CO2/brine system, as well as shale/oil/brine system to elevated pressures (8\u00a0MPa\u201322\u00a0MPa), temperatures (80\u00a0\u00b0C\u2013180\u00a0\u00b0C), and NaCl concentrations (0\u00a0wt% - 7\u00a0wt %), that are representative of downhole conditions. HPHT (high pressure, high temperature) drop shape analyzer (DSA100) instrument was employed for the contact angles and IFT measurements. The CO2/brine IFT was measured using the pendant drop method while the sessile drop/captive bubble techniques were used to measure the advancing and receding contact angles respectively. Correlations were developed for predicting changes in contact angles and CO2/brine IFT as a function of changing temperature, pressure and salinity. Results showed that the crude oil advancing and receding contact angles for shale/oil/brine system decreased with increasing temperature and salinity, but slightly increased with pressure. The brine advancing and receding contact angles of shale/CO2/brine system increased with increasing pressure and salinity, but decreased with increasing temperature. Conversely, the CO2/brine IFT increased with increasing temperature and salinity, but decreased with increasing pressure. The simulated and experimental values showed reasonable consistency with R2 values of 98% and 99% gotten from the statistical fits of the contact angles values. Precisely, at 80\u00a0\u00b0C and 7\u00a0wt% NaCl concentration, the shale surface became strongly CO2-wet, with brine advancing contact angles of 139.92\u00b0, 156.06\u00b0, and 162.63\u00b0 when the pressure reached 18\u00a0MPa, 20\u00a0MPa, and 22\u00a0MPa respectively. At similar salinity conditions and 10\u00a0MPa, significant increment in CO2/brine IFT from 36.50\u00a0mN/m to 47.54\u00a0mN/m occurred with increasing temperature from 80\u00a0\u00b0C to 180\u00a0\u00b0C. Such wettability modification of the rock surface and change in IFT at elevated temperature, pressure and salinity will greatly influence hydrocarbon recovery, as well as CO2 containment security in Malaysian unconventional shale formation.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Nurudeen Yekeen [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Eswaran Padmanabhan", "Hesham Abdulelah", "Sayed Ameenuddin Irfan", "Oluwagade Adenike Okunade", ", Javed Akbar Khan", "Berihun Mamo Negash"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Geo-storage; Interfacial tension; Carbon dioxide; Contact angle; Temperature; Pressure; Shale", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 196, 2021, 107673, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920410520307403", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Jan 2022"}
