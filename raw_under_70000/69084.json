It is famous for its effect in neuroprotective and wound-healing\nproperties. As to its effective ability to heal wounds, we want to evaluate the activity of several\nimportant constituents in C. asiatica in the other effects on skin, especially skin-aging. Asiaticoside,\nmadecassoside, asiatic acid, and madecassic acid are four of the most abundant constituents in C.\nasiatica. The presence of the four constituents in the C. asiatica extracts were confirmed using TLC\nanalysis: in ethyl acetate-methanol-water (8:1.5:0.5) eluent for the detection of asiaticoside and\nmadecassoside and chloroform-methanol (9:1) eluent for the detection of asiatic acid and\nmadecassic acid. The anti-aging activity of the four constituents was evaluated within the inhibition\nactivity toward elastase and tyrosinase enzyme in their elastase and tyrosinase inhibition assay. The\nresult showed that the asiaticoside, madecassoside, asiatic acid, and madecassic acid did not\npossess any anti-elastase activity but a potential activity on inhibiting tyrosinase enzyme. However,\na significant and potential activity of tyrosinase inhibition was obtained in the sample of C. asiatica\nethyl acetate extract with value above 45 percent with the leading potential compound, madecassic\nacid.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Shaskia Chintami Putri A": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/259928"}, "Penulis": "Shaskia Chintami Putri A [10718206]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Elfahmi, S.Si., M.Si.", "Amirah Adlia, S.Si., M.Si."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sains dan Teknologi Farmasi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Farmasi", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Centella asiatica, asiaticoside, madecassoside, asiatic acid, madecassic acid, skin-aging, elastase enzyme, tyrosinase enzyme", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Sep 2022"}
