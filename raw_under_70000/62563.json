{"Nomor": 62563, "Judul": "MINERALOGICAL ANALYSES AS A PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF RARE EARTH ELEMENTS ON PLACER DEPOSITS IN BELITUNG ISLAND, INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "Rare Earth Elements (REE), which can be found within various deposits, are crucial to the development of modern technology. Based on regional geological maps, it appears that monazite-bearing alluvial debris derived from granitic rocks is very widely distributed. There are potentially sizable alluvial tin deposits on the Indonesian islands of Karimun, Singkep, Bangka, and Belitung. This study aims to record the dispersion potential of REEs found in placer deposits on Belitung Island and to establish an exploration strategy that can be properly developed and managed. Samples were taken from 34 widespread points; these sample were then reduced to 20 representative points along various lithologies of an ancient alluvial fan on Belitung Island. The samples were\nanalyzed for minerals using grain counting and for elements via Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). According to the ICP-MS analysis, the potency of light REEs is more dominantly enriched in placer deposits than in primary deposits on Belitung Island. According to the grain counting analysis, the REEs on Belitung Island are located in the Sijuk Region (Northwest Belitung), the Kalapa Kampit Region, which reaches from the Damar Region to the Upper Gantung Region (Northeast of East Belitung), and the Lower Membalong Region (Southwest Belitung).", "Daftar File": {"COVER Syafrizal": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240916", "2017 SYAFRIZAL 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240917", "2017 SYAFRIZAL 1-PAPER.pdf6?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240919", "2017 SYAFRIZAL 1-TABLE OF CONTENTS.pdf5?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240920"}, "Penulis": "Syafrizal [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Teti Indriati, Komang Anggayana, Arie Naftali Hawu Hede, Ahnaf Muhammad"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Rare Earth Elements (REE), Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), Belitung Island", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Jan 2022"}
