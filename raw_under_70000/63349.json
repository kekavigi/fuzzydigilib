Ultra-low IFT (10e-3 mN/m) needs to be maintained in a reservoir to effectively reduce oil residual\nsaturation and improve oil recovery. One way to determine the interfacial tension is by using a spinning-drop\ntensiometer. However, this procedure is costly and time-consuming if one wants to measure the IFT at various\nsalinity and various surfactant candidates. Surfactant screening before determining IFT with a tensiometer is\npreferable as the number of candidates has been reduced and the range of optimum salinity has been optimum.\nOne of the surfactant screening processes is salinity scan or phase behavior test. A salinity scan can determine the\nrange of optimum salinity of the surfactant-brine-oil system which gives the lowest IFT. However, optimum\nsalinity only cannot determine which surfactant gives the better result. Utilizing Huh equation, one can determine\nthe IFT based on the solubilization ratio. This method recommends surfactant SAE as it can achieve the highest\nsolubilization ratio. However, this result is not aligned with lab measurements that recommend surfactant FEO.\nSome constant modification is applied to Huh equation and the result is similar to lab measurement. In this study,\nwe also explore the possibility to improve the Huh equation by utilizing salinity as a variable.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Rogan Steeven Saulus": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242609"}, "Penulis": "Rogan Steeven Saulus [12217020]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
