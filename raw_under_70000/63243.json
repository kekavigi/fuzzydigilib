{"Nomor": 63243, "Judul": "EFFECTIVENESS AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF SOLUTION GAS RE-INJECTION IN BAIKOUQUAN TIGHT FORMATION, MAHU SAG FOR ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY", "Abstrak": "To address the fast productivity decline of the horizontal wells and low oil recovery during natural depletion in Baikouquan formation, the approach of solution gas re-injection was proposed with the primary objective of further developing this formation. Herein, a field-scale numerical compositional reservoir model was built up based on the formation properties and then the effects of permeability, fractures and formation stress on the production dynamics were thoroughly investigated. A sensitivity analysis, which can correlate the oil recovery with these parameters, was also performed. The results showed that the re-injection of solution gas could remarkably retard the production depletion of the horizontal wells thereby improving the oil production. The oil recovery rate increased with permeability, fracture half-length, fracture conductivity, and formation dip. With regard to the fracture distribution, it was found that the interlaced fracture outperformed the aligned fracture for the solution gas re-injection. The influence of the formation stress should be carefully considered in the production process. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the formation dip was the paramount parameter, and the permeability, fracture half-length, and fracture conductivity also played central roles. The results of this study supplement earlier observations and provide constructive envision for enhanced oil recovery of tight reservoirs.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Bing Wei [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Tao Song", "Yan Gao", "Hua Xiang", "Xingguang Xu", "Valeriy Kadet", "Jinlian Bai", "Zhiwei Zhai"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Tight oil reservoir; Mahu sag; Solution gas re-injection; Numerical simulation; Fracturing; Sensitivity analysis", "Sumber": "Petroleum, Volume 6, Issue 3, 2020, Pages 253-263, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405656119301646", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Jan 2022"}
