Many researches have been conducted to investigate surfactant effectiveness either on a laboratory scale or a field scale. However there are still very little studies dealing with effect of surfactant on well inflow performance. It is predicted that there will be a well productivity improvement obtained as a result of the surfactant injection. An increase of well performance which is represented by productivity improvement term is the main objective addressed in this thesis. A single well reservoir modeling is built to determine the surfactant injection effect on well productivity. To observe the well productivity changes, huff and puff method is selected as the most representative method, and then, comparison of two main scenarios - before and after surfactant injection \u2013 productivity index is analyzed. Furthermore, through a parametric study, the important controlling parameters towards productivity improvement after surfactant injection are identified using an extensive sensitivity analyses.\nThe results indicate that there are well productivity improvement observed after surfactant injection which are controlled by several parameters. All controlling parameters are then correlated to well productivity index in new empirical equation to represent the general effect of related parameters to well productivity changes. The new equation is beneficial to determine an optimum surfactant properties as well as slug volume and time  soaking. In conclusion, by using this new equation, the application of surfactant huff and puff method in production well is expected to be simpler.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Antoni Desman Z": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240839", "BAB 1 Antoni Desman Z": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240840", "BAB 2 Antoni Desman Z": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240841", "BAB 3 Antoni Desman Z": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240842", "BAB 4 Antoni Desman Z": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240843", "BAB 5 Antoni Desman Z": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240844", "BAB 6 Antoni Desman Z": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240845", "PUSTAKA Antoni Desman Z": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240847"}, "Penulis": "Antoni Desman Z [22208327]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
