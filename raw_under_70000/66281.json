{"Nomor": 66281, "Judul": "CAPILLARY STRING SURFACTANT INJECTION CANDIDATE SELECTION METHOD: A CASE STUDY IN GAS FIELD \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdB\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd EAST KALIMANTAN", "Abstrak": "The demand for gas in Indonesia has increased, this of course affects gas production which also increases. This\nincrease in gas production occurred especially in East Kalimantan where this area has become the largest natural\ngas producing area in Indonesia. However, problems in gas production often occur and one of the most common\nis liquid loading. Handling liquid loading is generally done using deliquification methods. One of the\ndeliquification methods used in East Kalimantan, in particular, is capillary string surfactant injection.\nIn this study, the author proposes and conducts a gas well selection process for capillary string surfactant\ninjection in the \"B\" field. The selection method used was adapted to field conditions using available data. In the\nselection process, the author makes two additional methods using data from the use of capillary string surfactant\ninjection in the field and determines the cut-off from aspects of project success and the economic aspects\nrequired.\nThis selection method process was carried out on 344 gas wells (Strings) in field \"B\". Of the 344 gas wells\n(Strings), there are 79 data available and 21 wells are declared as candidates and 3 wells are used as a validation\nprocess of the method used. The method used is validated to select gas wells that are indicated to have liquid\nloading problems and are suitable for using the capillary string surfactant method.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Muhammad Fauzan Akmal": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250844"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Fauzan Akmal [12218083]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Amega Yasutra, S.T., M.T.", "Ibrahim Kunto S.T., M.SE."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Liquid loading problem, Deliquification method, Capillary string surfactant injection, Selection method", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Jun 2022"}
