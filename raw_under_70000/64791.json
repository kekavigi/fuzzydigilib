{"Nomor": 64791, "Judul": "A FLAVONOL AGLYCONE HAVING ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY ISOLATED FROM ETHANOLIC EXTRACT OF PHYLLANTHUS ACIDUS (L.) SKEELS LEAVES", "Abstrak": "Phyllanthus acidus is widely known and distributed throughout Asia. It is employed for many therapies like hepatotoxixity, hypertension, and skin diseases. This research was conducted to confirm the presence of flavonoid, to evaluate the antioxidant activity in the extract and fraction of Phyllanthus acidus leaves, and to isolate flavonoid with antioxidant activity. Phytochemical screening of the crude leaves showed the presence of saponins, catechuic tannins, steroid/triterpenoids and flavonoids. The crude drug was extracted by refluxing with ethanol 96% and monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC), while antioxidant activity was tested qualitatively by using DPPH (2,2-dipheny1-1-picrylhydrazyl) spray reagent and quantitatively by calculating IC50 of DPPH scavenging capacity. Total phenolic and flavonoid content were also measured. Fractionation was done by performing liquid-liquid extraction subsequently using n-hexane, ethyl acetate and water as the solvents and the fractions were monitored using TLC, accompanied by antioxidant test and IC50 of DPPH scavenging capacity for ethyl acetate fraction. The ethyl acetate fraction was refractionated using vacuum liquid chromatography and monitored by means of TLC. The qualitative and quantitative antioxidant tests were also performed for this fraction. Purification was conducted using preparative TLC and the isolate was tested for its purity using universal spray reagents. The isolate was characterized using paper chromatography and ultraviolet visible spectrophotometry aided by shift reagents. The ethyl acetate fraction showed a higher DPPH scavenging activity (IC50=50.174 pprn) than that of ethanolic extract (82.73 ppm). A flavonol was isolated and characterized based on two-dimensional paper chromatography and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry using shift reagents. Presence of flavonoid was confirmed and an isolate was obtained which has antioxidant activity. The isolate has been predicted as a flavonol, presumably a flavonol aglycone.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Visyalani Devi A P Rajeevan": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/248117"}, "Penulis": "Visyalani Devi A P Rajeevan [10709787]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dra.
