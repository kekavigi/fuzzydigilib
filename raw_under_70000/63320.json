Experiments were performed at various temperatures (405\u2013435\u00a0\u00b0C), LHSV (0.2\u20130.45 h?1), superficial gas velocities (0.4\u20132.2\u00a0cm/s) and pressures (80\u2013180\u00a0bar). As a result, it was found that the temperature and LHSV influenced the VR conversion, and the yield and properties of the product had a strong dependence on the VR conversion. And a reliable correlation between product yield, properties and VR conversion can be obtained using these relationships. In terms of the hydrogenation reaction, the change of hydrogen pressure significantly affected the removal of impurities, with reduced sediments. Even with the dispersed catalysts, it was confirmed that the sediment content rapidly increased at a certain VR conversion (about 50\u201360\u00a0wt%) as similarly a heterogeneous catalyst was shown. Finally, it was found to keep the VR conversion below 60\u00a0wt% and the pressure above 120\u00a0bar for the stable operation of the slurry-phase hydrocracking and sediment control.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Suk Hyun Lim [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Kang Seok Go", "Nam Sun Nho", "Yong Ku Kim", "Eun Hee Kwon", "Kwang Ho Kim", "Jae Goo Lee"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "hydrocracking, bench scale slurry bubble column reactor, sediments, VR conversion", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 196, 2021, 107713, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920410520307774", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Jan 2022"}
