{"Nomor": 63699, "Judul": "THE PROSPECT OF NATURAL GAS HYDRATE (NGH) UNDER THE VISION OF PEAK CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS IN CHINA", "Abstrak": "To achieve the goals of Peak Carbon Dioxide Emissions and Carbon Neutrality, China's energy system will continue to accelerate the transition to a clean and low-carbon one. As the cleanest fossil fuel, natural gas is regarded as an inevitable choice for China to build a clean, safe, efficient, and low-carbon energy system and fulfill the goal of \u201cdouble carbon\u201d. However, the domestic conventional natural gas supply remains rigid while the stimulation of unconventional natural gas is still limited. If we have a firm grip on the principal line of \u201cunderstanding the ocean -- developing resources -- ensuring security\u201d to realize the large-scale development of 85 trillion square meters of NGH in the South China Sea, then we could not only greatly reduce China \u2018s foreign dependence on natural gas, but also guarantee the safety of China \u2018s natural gas multi-path supply and safeguard the sovereignty of the South China Sea. Thus, the goal of Peak Carbon Dioxide Emissions and Carbon Neutrality can be achieved in no time.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Na Wei [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ruiling Bai", "Jinzhou Zhao", "Yao Zhang", "Jin Xue"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Natural gas hydrate; Peak carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon neutrality; Natural gas; Carbon emission reduction", "Sumber": "Petroleum, Volume 7, Issue 4, 2021, Pages 357-363, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405656121000833", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Feb 2022"}
