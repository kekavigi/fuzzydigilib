For many oil\nfields, sand production is a serious concern especially those with weakly consolidated reservoirs, sand production\nis a severe concern. This may lead to unfavorable consequences such as loss of well due to sand fill-up, restricted\nproduction, reduction of well productivity, detrimental damage, and/or excessive maintenance to both downhole\nand surface equipment, all of which could result in production loss, increased expenses, and safety issues.\nThe S Block is an onshore field with four fields and production of about 35 MMSCFD of gas and 9,000 BPD oil\nfrom more than 670 wells. The majority of hydrocarbon accumulations are found in a sequence of upper-delta and\ndelta-plain sandstone reservoirs from the Mid-Miocene. This field has more than 4500 unique reservoirs with\nvarying permeability that have a range from less than 1 mD to more than 1,500 mD and depth of productive layers\nstarting from 1,000 ft to 14,000 ft. Sandy well production contributes 25% - 30% of this block oil production.\nBefore being treated by Chemical Sand Consolidation, a lot of sandy wells produced far below their potential rate.\nBy using XX 225, the compressive strength improvement from Chemical Sand Consolidation was generally\nreported as Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) during laboratory core flow testing. The minimum\nrequirement for UCS and retaining permeability after the treatment is 1000 psi and 80% for a sand-free operation.\nThe results of the application of this treatment achieved success both in terms of engineering and economics. And\nalso, Chemical Sand Consolidation treatment will be ready to look for other candidate wells as an effort to\novercome sand production in this field.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Mahmuda Nurhadi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250782"}, "Penulis": "Mahmuda Nurhadi [12218031]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Amega Yasutra, S.T., M.T.", "Pahala Dominicus Sinurat, S.T., M.Sc."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "sand production, chemical sand consolidation, sandy well, oil production", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah \u00a0\n                                     Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Jun 2022"}
