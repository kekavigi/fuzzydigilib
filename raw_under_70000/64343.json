Cancer is one of the major diseases that lead to death and previous research was done by encapsulating etoposide in the form of nanomicelles. It was believed that certain nanoparticles size and the surface of nanoparticles will properties will have the long circulating properties in the blood system. In this study, poloxamer was use to form nanomicelles with the hydrophilic surface. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution profile of poloxamer nanomicelles in vivo. This study consisted of several stages. First, the labelling of poloxamer with 1-131 where 1-131 is able to emit radiation where can be measured with radioactive detection analyzer. Purity of labelled poloxamer and nanomicelles formed were 92.58% and 90.92%. The size of nanomicelles was 25.2 nm with polydispersity less than 0.5 and with measured zeta potential -0.03mV. Poloxamer nanoparticles in test group were detected to accumulate highly more in muscle, liver, thyroid and bone. 5.78+0.45% was found in muscle continued with in liver and thyroid each 3.40+0.10% and 3.07+2.08% then in bone 1.40+0.04%. While in control group it was tend to accumulate highly in thyroid with 6.05+4.09%, liver 2.49+0.17%, muscle 1.86+0.36% and bone 0.55+0.26%. The half life of poloxamer nanoparticles in test group and control group were 27.62+4.12 hours and 20.18+5.60 hours. The obtained half life was shorter than expected. The stability test showed that the bonding between 1-131 with poloxamer tends to be unstable in serum and it might be the reason why thyroid had high accumulation.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Tan Lay Hsien": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246426"}, "Penulis": "Tan Lay Hsien [10709718]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Diky Mudhakir, S.Si., M.Si., Ph.D.", "Prof. Dr. A.
