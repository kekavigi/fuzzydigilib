This study analyses and describes a workflow that aims to develop a Machine Learning model for\npredicting permeability and porosity in uncored wells utilizing core measurements integrated with available log\ndata as a feature to train. Different machine learning models including random forest, GradientBoost, artificial\nneural network, AdaBoost, SVM, XGBoost, and lasso regression are employed to have a comprehensive\ncomparison. The prediction results gained from the machine learning models used in this paper are compared to\nthe relevant real petrophysical data and empirical method to demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of\nusing artificial intelligence to predict reservoir characteristics. Both result for porosity and permeability prediction\nobtain machine learning as the best method with the best algorithm for porosity prediction is GradientBoost that\ngives R2 score of 0.847, while permeability prediction obtain the best R2 result of 0.771 by utilizing Support\nVector Machine algorithm and transforming some of feature and target variable to logarithmic values. The results\nreported in this thesis indicate that implication of machine learning methods in porosity and permeability\nestimations can lead to the construction of more reliable reservoir characteristics prediction.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Ahnaf Fairuz Gibran": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246862"}, "Penulis": "Ahnaf Fairuz Gibran [12216012]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Ir.
