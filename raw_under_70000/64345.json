{"Nomor": 64345, "Judul": "DETERMINING THE EFFICACY OF ANTI WRINKLE ACTIVITY USING   YOGURT IN CREAM FORMULATION", "Abstrak": "Yogurt is a fermented milk product produced by addition of live culture Lactobacillus bulgaricus. Based on research ,yogurt has good exfoliant property where it has the ability to reduce wrinkles on skin. The aim of this research is to develop cream formulation using yogurt and to test the efficacy towards wrinkle activity.The formulation of yogurt cream includes Cetomacrogol 1000 and Cetostearyl alcohol in the ratio of (2:8) respectively which acts as emulsifier and surface active agent. Vaseline and liquid paraffin was used as oil phase, while methyl paraben and propyl paraben were used as preservative. Curcumin was used as coloring agent in this oil-in-water cream formulation. The concentration of yogurt as active ingredient was 5%. The antioxidant activity of yogurt cream in base and the final dosage form was performed using DPPH Assay. Skin irritation test of final dosage form were conducted in rabbits and the In-situ evaluation was performed on volunteers using Video Dermatoscopy (VD) for three weeks.The yogurt cream formulation has good physical stabilities with no changes in color, smell, or phase separation and fungal growth throughout the evaluation which conducted for 28days at room temperature 25\u00b0C and at 40 \u00b0C at climatic chamber. The freeze thaw method showed the formulation was stable throughout the 6 cycles. Irritation test showed no edema or erythema found on the rabbit's skin upon the application of yogurt cream based on OECD calculation. Meanwhile the antioxidant activity which was done using DPPH Assay shows no significant differences when yogurt was incorporated into the cream base. The antioxidant activity of pure yogurt is 43.36\u00b5g/ml (50ppm) while for yogurt in cream base gives 54.21ug/m1 (50ppm) of antioxidant activity. Hence it shows that the antioxidant properties were stable when yogurt was incorporated into the cream base while in the final dosage form, it showed small significant difference which means it was not very stable for the first day and then it continued to be stable. The antioxidant activity of final dosage form was 54.671.tg/m1(50ppm). The antioxidant activity of standard ascorbic acid showed was 53.27ug/m1(25ppm).When compare to the standard, yogurt need twice the concentration to reach 1050 as standard. In-situ analysis on human skin showed positive results. Three out of six human volunteers shows reduction in wrinkle by daily application of this yogurt cream for 3 weeks. The linear gradient shows the reduction of wrinkle for subject 2, subject 4 and subject 5 with the gradient of -0.0102, -0.0015, and -0.0266 respectively The best formulation consist of 5% of yogurt, 2% curcumin, cetomacrogol 1000: cetostearyl alcohol (2:8), 10% of Vaseline and 20% of liquid paraffin. This formula shows good antioxidant activity and stabile throughout the 28 days of evaluation. Hence, the cream dosage form showed good effectiveness on anti-wrinkle activity using Video dermatoscopy instrument.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Tavamalar A P Krishnasamy": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246428"}, "Penulis": "Tavamalar A P Krishnasamy [10709720]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Sasanti Tarini, M.Si.", "Dr. rer. nat.
