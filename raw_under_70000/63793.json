{"Nomor": 63793, "Judul": "MONITORING OF BOREHOLE STABILITY AFTER BOREHOLE MINING OPERATION BY USING GROUND-PENETRATING-RADAR AND INDUCED POLARIZATION", "Abstrak": "Field investigation using Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Induced Polarization (IP) techniques has been\nconducted in Bangka Island to monitor the stability of borehole after Borehole Mining (BHM) operation. This\nBHM operation resulted a cavity forming in the borehole due to extraction of the alluvial tin layer. If the\noverburden over the extracted layer cannot hold the stability of the borehole, the cavity formed in the hole can\nreach the surface. Based on field observations, precisely in the Air Nudur Block (South Bangka Regency) and Air\nGumuruh Block (West Bangka Regency), cavities that formed on the surface can occur within a span time of a few\nhours to several days after extraction of alluvial tin ore in the BHM hole is finished and the drill cased steel is\nremoved. We deployed GPR system with 100 MHz shielded antenna before and after BHM mining operation and\ntime domain IP system with 1.5 m electrode spacing conducted after BHM. Our research results show that both\nGPR and IP techniques supported with numerical modeling reveal an overburden slide and subsidence in the\nBHM bore", "Daftar File": {"2019 Cover - Wahyudi Widyatmoko P.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/244718", "2019 Editorial Board - Wahyudi Widyatmoko P.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/244719", "2019 Table Content - Wahyudi Widyatmoko P.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/244720", "2019 Paper - Wahyudi Widyatmoko P.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/244721"}, "Penulis": "Wahyudi W.
