{"Nomor": 62648, "Judul": "ON PHYSICS-INFORMED NEURAL NETWORK (PINN) IN SOLVING VISCOUS FLUID FLOW PROBLEMS", "Abstrak": "Despite its well-known ability in solving a fluid flow, the CFD method has several shortcomings,\nincluding a rigorous meshing process and careful numerical method consideration,\nwhich inevitably results in a trade-off between accuracy and computation time. In this\nthesis, we have an interest in tackling these shortcomings by employing a machine learning\nmethod called physics-informed neural network (PINN). In its early study, PINN shows capability\nin solving several fluid flow problems. However, it is still in its infancy. To assess\nPINN potential as an alternative flow field solver, this thesis studies the PINN capability\nin terms of its formulations, hyperparameters, and configurations on several benchmark\nflow problems that focus on accuracy and computation times metrics. Moreover, we also\nperformed an in-depth study about the transfer learning method that could accelerate the\nPINN computation time, whereby is favorable specifically in design exploration. The results\nconcluded that PINN performed well in solving fluid flow by producing a good accuracy on\nthe benchmark problems. Furthermore, the transfer learning method significantly reduces\nPINN computation time, even when engaged in different domain and boundary conditions.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Cahya Amalinadhi Putra": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/241244"}, "Penulis": "Cahya Amalinadhi Putra [23619305]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Lavi Rizki Zuhal", "Pramudita Satria Palar, S.T., M.T., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Physics-Informed Neural Network, Deep Learning, Navier-Stokes equations, Trans- fer learning.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Jan 2022"}
