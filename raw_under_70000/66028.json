{"Nomor": 66028, "Judul": "IMPLEMENTATION OF COMPUTER VISION FOR AUTONOMOUS LANDING SYSTEM IN UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES", "Abstrak": "In this thesis, a method to create an Autonomous Landing System for use in Naval-based\nUAV is formulated by incorporating a deep-learning computer vision model based on\nYOLOv4 combined with a distance estimator to deduce a landing coordinate on a UAV\nequipped with a camera and an embedded computer. Images from the camera is processed\nusing the developed vision model, outputting a bounding box that are then calculated using\nstadiametric rangefinding to measure distance. The attitudes of the camera as well as the UAV\nis combined with the measured distance, outputting a coordinate that can then be fed to the\nUAV????s Flight Controller. During testing, the system starts measuring distance to the landing\nship from 1.4km away, with an average of 10% error in distance in ideal conditions.\nPerformance in inclement weather is also tested, only being able to start measuring from\naround 400m with similar error rates afterwards", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK DARIEL VALDANO": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250443"}, "Penulis": "DARIEL VALDANO [23619309]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Taufiq Mulyanto, S.T.", "Dr. Khairul Ummah, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, Autonomous Landing, Image to Coordinate Conversion, Computer Vision, YOLOv4", "Sumber": "FTMD", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Jun 2022"}
