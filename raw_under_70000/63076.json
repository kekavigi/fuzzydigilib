The modeling consists of three sub-models: (1) The distribution of the asphaltene particles along the pipe, (2) The transfer of asphaltene particles from the bulk to the wall using the Eulerian approach, (3) Adhesion of asphaltene particles to the wall. The most important transport and deposition mechanisms, including the drag, molecular diffusion, eddy diffusion, turbo-phoresis, and thermo-phoresis, are considered in simulations. To calculate the adhesion velocity, the concept of the adhesion coefficient is employed for particle bins. The results of adhesion velocity show that the particle size, surface temperature and fluid velocity strongly affect the adhesion of particles. Therefore, accurate modeling of the adhesion step considering the interaction of the particles has significant effects on the prediction of asphaltene deposition rate. Furthermore, the effects of changing the process conditions including the surface temperature, fluid velocity and asphaltene concentration on the deposition rate and size distribution of particles, are investigated. The results showed that considering the particle size distribution and particles\u2019 interaction reduces the error of numerical simulations. The developed framework can be employed for further investigation of asphaltene deposition using multi-fluid approaches.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mahdi Ghorbani [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Reza Maddahian"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Asphaltene precipitation; Population balance approach; Deposition velocity; Adhesion velocity; Mixture approach", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 196, 2021, 107665,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920410520307324", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Jan 2022"}
