{"Nomor": 67112, "Judul": "DESIGN AND FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS OF CAGE WHEEL FOR TRACTOR OPERATING ON PEAT SOIL", "Abstrak": "Forest restoration projects have become increasingly common around the world and\nplanting trees is almost always a key component. Low seedling survival and growth may\nresult in restoration failures and various mechanical site preparation techniques for treatment\nof soils and vegetation are important tools used to help counteract this. Beforehand, there is a\nprocess to prepare the land used for the plantation. One of the processes is called ploughing.\nPloughing process is usually done by either conventional tractor or machine power tractor.\nThe company is located at Sumatra Island and mostly the area there is covered with peat soil.\nPeat soil is a type of land that is very commonly used in plantation areas in Indonesia. The\nproblem that arises is companies that use tractor operation uses cage wheel which cannot\nperform efficiently. Previous wheels used by the company weren't effectively used while\nworking as the wheel is heavy and the shape structure of the wheel makes the soil stuck into\nthe wheel and gradually will obstruct the process. This research aims to create an optimal new\ndesign of cage wheel that is suitable with Design Requirement & Objective (DR&O) that has\nbeen made, perform static structural analysis of the new design with certain boundary\nconditions and loading conditions, then analyze the results of the simulation. The method\nused in this research is a finite element method by conducting a modeling process using\nSolidworks\u00ae and a simulation process using ANSYS. The output of this study is a new cage\nwheel design with certain fulfilled requirements that hopefully will give better working\nperformance when used later by the company.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Zahra Rizkita Putri": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/255186"}, "Penulis": "Zahra Rizkita Putri [13117211]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
