{"Nomor": 64560, "Judul": "THE EFFECT OF SITAGLIPTIN AND LANSOPRAZOLE OR MELATONIN COMBINATION IN DIABETES MELLITUS SWISS WEBSTER MICE INDUCED BY ALLOXAN", "Abstrak": "Recent studies trends in diabetic animal models are focusing in pancreatic islet beta cell regeneration in order to reverse the diabetic state. This study was conducted to determine the effect of the combination treatment of sitagliptin and lansoprazole or melatonin to restore normoglycemia in NOD mice and regenerate islet beta cells. The mice were injected intravenously alloxan monohydrate to induce diabetic condition. The combination treatment included sitagliptin / lansoprazole (13 / 3.9 mg/kg bw ; 100 / 30 mg/kg bw). Another combination treatment was sitagliptin / melatonin (13 / 0.78 mg/kg bw). Those combinations were administered orally for thirty and sixty days. The parameters included blood glucose level, SGOT/SGPT level and histological study of pancreatic islet cells. All the three combination treatment can reduce blood glucose levels significantly (p<0.05) and histopathological studies revealed the recovery of islet cells. The three combinations however showed similar effect on reduction of blood glucose level and recovery of islet beta cells.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Grizzel Chin Ni": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/247094"}, "Penulis": "Grizzel Chin Ni [10710761]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Maria Immaculata Iwo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sains dan Teknologi Farmasi", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Farmasi", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "-", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "yana mulyana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Mei 2022"}
