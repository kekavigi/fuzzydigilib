{"Nomor": 63224, "Judul": "THE EFFECT OF PORT AND COASTAL DEFENCE STRUCTURE ON COASTAL MORPHOLOGY CASE STUDY: DADAP BEACH, INDRAMAYU REGENCY", "Abstrak": "Human activities in coastal areas will generally lead to a greater rate of erosion\nand tidal flooding due to the loss of natural protection in the form of mangrove or\ninappropriate structures in coastal areas. Dadap Beach, located in Juntinyuat\nDistrict, Indramayu Regency, West Java Province is one of the locations\nexperiencing problems above. In 2003, a Fishing Port (PPI) was built on Dadap\nBeach with structure that jutted into the sea 200 m from the shoreline. This port\nstructure is designed to prevent sedimententation from the longshore sediment\ntransport, but currently there has been a massive sediment depositionin the port\npool area, and a tombolo is formed behind the port structure. The existence of this\ntombolo disturbs the balance of sediment transport in the coastal area around the\nport, so that in recent years the rate of coastal erosion has increased significantly\nand threatens rice fields and settlements. Furthermore, to overcome the coastal\nerosion, BBWS Cimanuk-Cisanggarung has built a coastal protection structure in\nform of an offshore breakwater. This study aims to analyze the hydromorphologycal\neffect of port structure and coastal protection at Dadap Beach, Juntinyuat District,\nIndramayu Regency at the surrounding coastal area, using a numerical model\nsimulation (Delft 3D). The simulation results show that the existence of the port\nstructure and coastal protection at Dadap Beach causes changes in current\npatterns due to wave diffraction by the port structure, which causes a significant\ndecrease in longshore current velocity behind the structure and interrupting the\nlongshore sediment transport balance. The results of this study are expected to\nprovide a reference regarding the effect of coastal structures located in shallow\nwater areas on currents pattern and sediment transport, so that the negative\nimpacts of these structures can be anticipated properly.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Muhammad Shodiq Supriyanto": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/242361"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Shodiq Supriyanto [25820024]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
