{"Nomor": 61865, "Judul": "EVALUATION OF EQUAL SLOPE METHOD FOR OPTIMIZING THE PRODUCTION IN A FIELD WITH MORE THAN ONE ARTIFICIAL LIFT", "Abstrak": "Oil and gas production is a process of fluid lifting from a reservoir to the surface through a production facility. The decline in oil and gas production is a natural thing considering the reservoir pressure will decrease along with production, so that the reservoir is not able to flow fluids to the surface naturally anymore. The only way to get a high level of well production again is to increase the production pressure drawdown by reducing bottom-hole pressure with an artificial lift method.The equal slope method is applied to the field with one artificial lift, the gas lift. In this study, the authors want to evaluate the use of the equal slope method for optimizing the production of a field with more than one artificial lift, gas lift and ESP (Electrical Submersible Pump). In optimizing the production of a field using ESP (Electrical Submersible Pump). Usually, the analysis of the selection of the ESP pump is carried out well so that there will be quite a lot of pump variations. Thus, spare parts ESP pump will vary greatly. In this study, the author wants to analyze the selection of pumps in a field more efficiently by considering the production limit of the well from a field and the range production rate of the ESP pump so that the number of pumps used will be optimal and can be used throughout the lifetime of the well.\nThe results of this study indicate that a pump selection method is needed first following the production rate of the well in the TM field before applying the equal slope method to the ESP well by constrained the pump efficiency and pump production range to the wells production limit. This method provides a pump recommendation that is following the production limits of the well so that the amount of pump used is compatible and efficient.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Muhammad Allan Nurin": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/236943"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Allan Nurin [12217061]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Amega Yasutra, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Equal Slope, Artificial Lift, Surface Facility", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Sep 2021"}
