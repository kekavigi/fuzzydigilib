{"Nomor": 62140, "Judul": "COMPARISON OF LANDSAT-8 AND SENTINEL-2 IMAGERY FOR IDENTIFYING HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION IN A VEGETATED AREA", "Abstrak": "Multispectral imagery has proven successful in mapping hydrothermal alteration in both arid and semi-arid areas. The remote sensing method can be used for mineral exploration in humid tropical regions with thick vegetation. This study compared Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery in identifying hydrothermal alteration zones in a vegetated area. The Cineam area in West Jaya was chosen as the case study because this region is known for the presence of low sulfidation gold deposits and well-developed alteration zones. Some soil and surface rock samples were collected for reflectance spectroscopy analysis and validated using X-ray diffraction for mineral\nidentification. Spectral mapping algorithms, including band ratio-band combination and directed principal component analysis, were used to identify the target alteration minerals. The results showed that a given algorithm is suitable for mapping minerals in a particular condition. Based on the average performance of the two sensors, Sentinel-2 showed a better indicator value compared with Landsat-2. This is due to differences in the spectral and spatial resolutions of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8. The argument is that build-up, especially in the visible\u2014near infrared range in which Sentinel-2 identifies iron-related minerals and distinguishes land use-land cover better than Landsat-8.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Arie Naftali Hawu Hede": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/239203", "2021 COMPARISON OF LANDSAT-8 AND SENTNEL-2 -PAPER.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/239204"}, "Penulis": "Arie Naftali Hawu Hede [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Syafrizal, Dzaki Fakhri Khairo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Teknik Pertambangan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "hydrothermal, spectroscopy, X-ray", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Des 2021"}
