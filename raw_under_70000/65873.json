{"Nomor": 65873, "Judul": "QUALITY CONTROL SYSTEM DESIGN OF A TRAIN WEIGHING TEST USING CYBER PHYSICAL SYSTEM PRINCIPLES", "Abstrak": "The Fourth Industrial Revolution has drawn the attention of many manufacturing\nindustries. Many has implement this concept by adopting Cyber-Physical System (CPS)\nprinciples, a key element of Industry 4.0, in its manufacturing processes. The heightened\nintelligence of production elements enhances its decision making ability and information\nmanagement. Quality control process of a manufactured product requires fast and precise\ndecision making, therefore, adopting the principles of CPS would be highly beneficial for this\nprocess.\nIn this final project, a web application was designed to facilitate the development of a\nCPS based train carriage weighing test. The application was designed to display inspection\nresults and conclusion by formulating information obtained from the weighing test, which\nwould limit the drawbacks of a conventional inspection as number of errors and time required\nfor the process is reduced. The system of the application designed was tested on various\ninspection conditions in reference to the document issued for the weighing test of a Kereta Rel\nListrik (KRL) train carriage. Based on the test, the web application was able to fulfil the design\nrequirements of each in-app user roles by providing conclusions regarding the results of the\nweighing test.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Nawra Syahiramarsa Widodo": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250263"}, "Penulis": "Nawra Syahiramarsa Widodo [13117210]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Prof. Dr. Ir.
