{"Nomor": 62453, "Judul": "STATISTICS AND SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION ANALYSIS OF CU-AU GRADES IN ALTERATION AND LITHOLOGY DOMAINS AT WANAGON PROSPECT, PAPUA, INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "Statistics and spatial distribution analysis is important in the early stages o f resources modeling, as these will affect decisions made regarding technical exploration and exploitation determinations. Univariate and bivariate analysis, probability plots, normality and outlier tests were used to determine the domains control o f Cu-Au grades distribution in the Wanagon Gold Prospect in Papua, Indonesia. Geostatistical analysis was carried out including experimental variograms and Ordinary Kriging estimation. The complexity o f the Wanagon Gold geology, particularly the Wanagon-Mill, North Wanagon, and Batu-Big Gossan faults significantly affected Cu-Au domain classification, where each domain comprises a zone with distinct lithology and alteration. As well as controlling rock distribution, the faults also provided pathways for hydrothermal fluids that subsequently altered and mineralized the surrounding Tertiary\nWaripi and Cretaceous Kembelangan Group Sediments. The nearby Wanagon Sill intrusion might also have contributed to Cu-Au mineralization in the Wanagon Prospect.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Ayu Bedtrik": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240325", "2017 AYU BEDTRIK 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240326", "2017 AYU BEDTRIK 1-TABLE OF CONTENTS.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240327", "2017 AYU BEDTRIK 1-PAPER.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240328"}, "Penulis": "Ayu Bedtrik [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mohamad Nur Heriawan, Arie Naftali Hawu Hede, Endang Hartiningsih, Reza Al Furqan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Cu-Au grade, outlier test, alteration, lithology, fault, Wanagon Prospect", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "03 Jan 2022"}
