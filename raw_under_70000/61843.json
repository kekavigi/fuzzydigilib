{"Nomor": 61843, "Judul": "LITERATURE REVIEW ON THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN COVID-19 AND TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS INCLUDING ITS CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND OUTCOMES, PATHOGENICITY, AND THERAPY", "Abstrak": "COVID-19 pandemic is a respiratory infectious disease caused by a novel human coronavirus called\nSARS-CoV-2. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic non-communicable disease that becomes a\nworldwide epidemic in recent decades, and is reported to have increased risk for a poor prognosis\nand mortality in the ongoing COVID-19 situation. COVID-19 and DM represent a worrying public\nhealth crisis, as DM represent a large vulnerable segment of the population. This literature review\naims to systematically present the interplay between DM and COVID-19 through observational\nstudies of clinical characteristics and outcomes, pathogenic association, and the link between their\ntherapy. 96 literature are selected through advanced keyword and inclusive criteria. DM and\nCOVID-19 are proven to present a worse prognosis through parameters in relation to inflammatory\nmarkers, abnormal immune response, tissue damage, and organ injury. DM is reported as an\nindependent risk factor for severity and mortality. DM and COVID-19 association is proposed to\nhave mirroring conditions due to various shared mechanisms. Moreover, both diseases are\nconsidered to portray a vicious cycle that aggravates the condition of each diseases, leading to a\nmore severe outcome. The categorization of DM severity with COVID-19 is crucial to implement the\nappropriate therapeutic intervention, having insulin and DPP4i as the safest option. Approved\nCOVID-19 drugs are shown to have effective glycaemic control and can be used in DM individuals.\nFurther research on the most updated data is required to intensively address the management of\nDM individuals with COVID-19.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK AUDREY ANGELINE AIPASSA": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/236906"}, "Penulis": "AUDREY ANGELINE AIPASSA [10717207]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. apt.
