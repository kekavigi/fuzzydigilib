{"Nomor": 61495, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT OF ALKALINE HYDROGEL ELECTROLYTE AND REDUCED GRAPHENE OXIDE FOR AIR CATHODE FOR SECONDARY ZINC-AIR BATTERIES", "Abstrak": "The world demands portable electrochemical storage systems for commercial and sustainable\ntechnology use. The demand for lithium-ion batteries are expected to reach 2000 GWh by\n2030. Research on secondary zinc-air batteries can alternatively store chemical energy\nbecause of zinc\u2019s abundance, specific power, and low life cycle costs. However, zinc-air\nbatteries use liquid electrolytes, which are vulnerable to leakage and water evaporation. They\nalso suffer from the inefficiency of air catalysts and poor energy density.\nThis research aims to develop hydrogel electrolytes and air cathodes suitable for the zinc-air\nbattery. This research compares the performance of the zinc air battery with synthetic and\nnon-synthetic hydrogels. This research also aims to find the optimum production method of\nreduced graphene oxide (rGO) which could be used in place of graphene for air cathodes.\nThe variation of reduction methods are thermal and chemical reduction using ascorbic acid.\nThe hydrogels will undergo water uptake tests and be analysed with electrochemical\nimpedance spectroscopy (EIS). The physical appearances and densities of the rGOs will also\nbe analysed and compared.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Rachendra Akmalia": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/236346"}, "Penulis": "Rachendra Akmalia [13017105]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr.Eng.
