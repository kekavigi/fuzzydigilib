The economies of Global South countries, including Indonesia, have transitioned from agriculture to manufacturing and services. As a result, living conditions in those countries have deteriorated. Climate and environmental change, as well as the extraction of natural resources for rural livelihoods, have increased the risk factors of agricultural practicee for millions of smallholders. Cianjur Regency is one of the regencies responsible for the growth of West Java's leading industry. Sukaluyu District is one of the large and medium industrial areas built on productive and irrigated rice fields in the last decade. These environmental changes have an impact on farmers' ability to access natural resources, affecting their assets and their choices of livelihood strategies in the face of industrial existence. A sustainable livelihoods framework approach can identify the level of household vulnerability, the structure and processes, the amount of livelihood capital, the livelihood strategies, and how the outcomes of livelihoods responding to the changes caused by industrial development. This research employs an exploratory research approach, which is a mixed convergent study in which quantitative and qualitative data are collected concurrently and used to obtain a more complete picture of the observed phenomena. The Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) is used to assess the level of vulnerability, while the Livelihood Capital Index (LCI) is used to assess the level of livelihood capital. The Spearman rank correlation is used to understand the relationship between livelihood capital and livelihood strategies.\nv\nAccording to the findings, smallholders and landowners have a medium level of vulnerability. The trend factor is the most vulnerable. The variables with the highest trend factors are the low ownership of tractor machines, the increase in land prices after the industrial area, and the difficulty in finding agricultural workers. Shock is a factor which causes the second-highest level of vulnerability. Drought and large rat pest attacks after the factory's establishment caused a decrease in land productivity. Natural capital and human capital constitute the majority of sharecroppers' and landowners' subsistence capital. Meanwhile, the financial capital is in the lowest rank among other capitals. Smallholders' top four livelihood strategies include protection, intensification, diversification, and claim. Meanwhile, landowners intensify, protect, hoard, diversify, and deplete their operations. The Spearman rank correlation results show that livelihood capital have a significant effect on the livelihood strategies employed by farmer households. In terms of farmers' livelihoods, agricultural income is insufficient to meet household needs, therefore they must seek other sources of income or income diversification. Despite diversifying their income, some farmers still receive social assistance. Since the establishment of the industry, community participation in gotong-royong activities has declined. Furthermore, the residents also stated that conflict and crime in the area were relatively rare. Meanwhile, the majority of farmers reported that access to education and health care was accessible and affordable due to the PKH program and 9 years of mandatory education. In the meantime, the owner farmers have enough food for a year. In contrast to sharecroppers, who received a large amount of food assistance. In terms of natural resource sustainability, while the majority of farmers use organic fertilizers when cultivating the soil, the use of organic pesticides is still very relatively low.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Eliza Mardian": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250009", "BAB 1 Eliza Mardian": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250010", "BAB 2 Eliza Mardian": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250011", "BAB 3 Eliza Mardian": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250012", "BAB 4 Eliza Mardian": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250013", "BAB 5 Eliza Mardian": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250014", "BAB 6 Eliza Mardian": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250015", "DAFTAR Eliza Mardian": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250016"}, "Penulis": "Eliza Mardian [24020015]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Ir.
