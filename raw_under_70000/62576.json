There have been many approaches developed to reduce the emission of\nCarbon Dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere, among which Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) techniques has been\nrecognized as the most promising method. This paper provides a deeper insight about the CCS technology where\nCO2 is captured and stored in deep geological formations for stabilization of the earth's temperature. Principles\nof capturing and storage for a long-term sequestration are also discussed together with the processes, mechanisms\nand interactions induced by supercritical CO2 upon injection into subsurface geological sites.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ARSHAD RAZA [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Raoof Gholami", "Reza Rezaee", "Vamegh Rasouli", "Minou Rabiei"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "CCS technologies, CO2 capture, CO2 transportation, CO2 storage, Leakage, Costs", "Sumber": "Petroleum , Volume 5, Issue 4, Pages 335-340 (December 2019), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2018.12.007", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Jan 2022"}
