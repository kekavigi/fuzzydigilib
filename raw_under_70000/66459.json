Geothermal, with its significant\npotential, is expected to contribute to achieving that target.\nGeothermal project phases involve the feasibility study of the field soon to be developed both technically and\neconomically analyzed and estimated for the future project of the geothermal field. In this study, a technoeconomic\nstudy was conducted on X Geothermal Field with estimating reserves of the field using Monte Carlo\nsimulation, and an economic model built appropriately based on scheduling on developing the geothermal field.\nReserves were calculated using the volumetric method of heat stored in the reservoirs using data based on the\nprevious study conducted and general assumption data, resulting low ectimate of 197.8 MW, moderate of 277.4\nMW, and high estimate 374.8 MW of reserves.\nIn the economic aspect, a feasibility study was conducted for three scenarios of probability reserves. Economic\ncalculation is analyzed through the economic indicator; IRR, NPV, and payout time of the project. The three\ndevelopment scenarios are resulting the positive value of IRR and NPV with reasonable payout time. This\nconcludes that X Field Geothermal is a promising field to be developed with further study and analysis to confirm\nthe result of this study.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Farisa Emilia Yudistira": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/251162"}, "Penulis": "Farisa Emilia Yudistira [12218060]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dimas Taha Maulana, S.T., M.T.", "Angga Bakti Pratama, S.Si., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Monte Carlo simulation, Feasibility Study, Reserves Probabilities, Project Economic Calculation.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Jun 2022"}
