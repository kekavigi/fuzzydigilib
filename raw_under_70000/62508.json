{"Nomor": 62508, "Judul": "MINERALIZATION HORIZON AND STRUCTURE CONTROL OF EPITHERMAL SYSTEM AT GUNUNG SUBANG, CIANJUR, WEST JAVA, INDONESIA: IMPLICATION FOR EXPLORATION", "Abstrak": "The aim of the study is to apply the analysis of mineralization horizon and lineament for exploration in the studied area especially for precious metal exploration. Studied area is located at Gunung Subang, southern part of Cianjur District, West Java, Indonesia. The mineralization is associated with quartz vein at NNE-SSW trending. There are three veins outcrop that have been observed and analyzed: Cicelak vein, Cigadobras vein and Cilangkap vein. The alteration type consists of silisification, argilic alteration and prophylitic alteration. The mineral assemblage consists of galena\u201esphalerite, pyrite, and chalcopyrite and quartz as dominant gangue mineral. The boiling zone occurs at Cicelak vein, indicated by the occurrence of bladed calcite and fluids inclusions. The hydrothermal fluids temperature has interval between 210\u00b0C and 286\u00b0C and the salinity is ranging from 0.3 eq wt % NaC1 to 2.7 eq wt % NaCI. The estimated depth of formation is about 305 m to 445 m below paleo water table. The mineralization can be categorized as epithermal low sulfidation. The mineralization horizon gradational from lower to upper outcrops elevation suggests the sequence of base metal horizon-boiling zone precious metal horizon. The precious metal horizon can occur in the higher elevation from boiling zone (>355 m). This zone also has extension trend and it is categorized of high frequent lineament area. The delineated area is the exploration target in Gunung Subang especially for precious metal (Au-Ag) exploration.", "Daftar File": {"COVER Ismayanto": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240762", "2009 ISMAYANTO 1-EDITORIAL BOARD.pdf?": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240763", "2009 ISMAYANTO 1-TABLE OF CONTENT.pdf\n]": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240764", "2009 ISMAYANTO 1-PAPER.pdf)u": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/240765"}, "Penulis": "Ismayanto [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Syafrizal, Sudarto Notosiswoyo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Epithermal, Horizon, structure, exploration", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Resti Andriani", "File": "4 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Jan 2022"}
