{"Nomor": 62507, "Judul": "ASSISTED HISTORY MATCHING AND GRAPHICAL METHODS FOR ESTIMATING INDIVIDUAL LAYER PROPERTIES FROM WELL TESTING DATA IN STRATIFIED RESERVOIRS WITH MULTILATERAL WELLS", "Abstrak": "One of the main purposes for conducting well tests is to obtain information about reservoir parameters, such\nas its permeability and the existence of skin effects. Determining individual layer properties from pressure\ntransient data in multilayer reservoirs is challenging, since pressure behavior is influenced by the properties\nof all layers. This work presents three methods for estimating layer properties from well testing data in\nmultilayer reservoirs with multilateral wells. First, we extend two existing graphical straight-line methods\nfor estimating individual layer properties in multilayer systems with vertical wells to stratified reservoirs with\nmultilateral horizontal wells. These techniques are the rate-normalized pressure analysis and the delta transient\nmethod. Both methods require a clear identification of radial flow regimes, which may not occur in a practical\ncase. Additionally, we show that a computer-assisted history matching method based on the Nelder\u2013Mead\noptimization algorithm can also be used to evaluate layer permeabilities and skin. This optimization method\ndoes not rely on the identification of any specific flow regime. Estimates obtained from the graphical methods\nwere used as initial guess for the assisted history matching. The proposed techniques are applied on a set of\nsynthetic well-test cases, where pressure and layer flow-rate profiles are computed from an existing analytical\nmodel. Results show that all three methods are able to yield good estimates for layer properties if both earlyand\nlate-time radial flow are observed. In cases where only one of the radial flow regimes is identified, then\nthe NM algorithm provides the best results, showing that the assisted history matching improved the estimates\nprovided by the graphical method.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Renan Vieira Bela [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Sinesio Pesco", "Abelardo Borges Barreto Jr.", "Mustafa Onur"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "Well testing, Multilateral wells,Commingled reservoirs,Rate-normalized pressure analysis, Delta transient method, Nelder\u2013Mead algorithm", "Sumber": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 208, Part A,\u00a0January 2022, 109326", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Jan 2022"}
