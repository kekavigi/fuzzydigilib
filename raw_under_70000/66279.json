{"Nomor": 66279, "Judul": "STUDY ON SIDE EFFECTS OF PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATION USED IN A MALAYSIAN HOSPITAL AND THEIR IN SILICO TOXICITY PROFILES", "Abstrak": "Psychiatric disorders are still prevalent with the number of Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) due to\npsychiatric disorders increased from 80\u00b78 million to 125\u00b73 million and the proportion of DALYs\nattributed to psychiatric disorders increased from 3\u00b71% to 4\u00b79% globally in this world. With a finding\na data from one of private hospitals in Malaysia, in 2019 around 29 types of psychiatric drugs were\nprescribed and dispensed to patients. In addition, according to the National Anti-Drug Agency\nMalaysia, the rate of abuse of psychiatric drugs is surprisingly increasing. With the rising use of\nantipsychotic drugs in Malaysia, pharmacists and the physicians need to be aware of the adverse\neffects. Severe side effects are hazardous to patients and might cause fatality. While the side effects\nare sometimes unpredictable, the mechanisms can be studied using in silico approach. The aim of this\nstudy was to compile psychiatric drugs most used in a Malaysian hospital, and further study their\npotential toxicity using in silico methods. We collected data of patients under psychiatric medication\ntreatment. The psychiatric drugs used were classified into stimulant, antianxiety, mood stabilizer, and\nopioid analgesic. The most prescribed medicine from each class was studied further for its toxic profile\nusing in silico method of OECD QSAR Toolbox v.4. In total, the number of patients under psychiatric\nmedication were 144 and the drugs were classified into stimulant, antianxiety, mood stabilizer, and\nopioid analgesic. Representative drugs from each class were midazolam alprazolam, lorazepam, and\nfentanyl, respectively. Results of the in silico study showed that alprazolam was associated with\nhepatic and renal toxicity, midazolam with cardiotoxicity, lorazepam with hepatotoxicity, and\nfentanyl with reproductive toxicity. Taken together, results of the present study warrant the\nawareness of health professionals, especially pharmacist, for the potential toxic effects of psychiatric\ndrugs used in hospital setting.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Afiq Salim bin Agu Salim": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250842"}, "Penulis": "Afiq Salim bin Agu Salim [11619762]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. rer. nat. apt.
