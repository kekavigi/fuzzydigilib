As one of\nprincipal components of amphibious aircraft, the analysis of aircraft pontoon\nwithstanding an impact load during landing is carried out. Landing phase has been\nconsidered as critical condition as the structures were being dependable to handle\nthe supporting role for the whole aircraft.\nWithin ABAQUS environment, FSI simulation is performed by utilising the\nCoupled Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) in maintaining the solid body being\nundisturbed by the fluids, instead it flows around the body. With the development\nof computational mechanics, such methods known as Multiscale Modelling is\nintroduced to reduce computational time and resource while still maintaining its\naccuracy. As the Multistage Multiscale Modelling has been carried out, here, the\nConcurrent Multiscale Modelling is performed as an alternative strategy to model\nthe pontoon section undergoes hydrodynamic loading.\nBeforehand, static convergence tests were conducted to ensure the reliability of\nelements size being used during the simulation. Moreover, from the FSI simulation,\nthe Concurrent Multiscale Model turned out to be outperformed the global solid\nmodel, while having a comparable performance with the Multistage Multiscale\nModelling, in terms of stress distribution and usage of computational resource,\ncompared to the global shell model as the reference.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Muhammad Rizki Mahalik": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/256295"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Rizki Mahalik [23620035]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Ir.
