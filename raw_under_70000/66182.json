{"Nomor": 66182, "Judul": "AIR LOGISTICS OF COVID-19 VACCINE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF MILITARY OPERATION OTHER THAN WAR IN PAPUA", "Abstrak": "COVID-19 is an ongoing global pandemic which caused 1,566,995 confirmed\ncases, 109,958 active cases with 42,530 deaths from the virus per 4 April 2021.\nDue to the gravity of the impact of the pandemic, the government of Indonesia has\nestablished the COVID-19 Pandemic as a national disaster of the non-natural\ncategory. Effort that can be pursued to combat this pandemic is the deployment of\nCOVID-19 vaccines. In order to to ensure optimal delivery of the target of the\nvaccination program, a robust logistic system must be prepared. However,\nIndonesia\u2019s logistic infrastructure condition can be generally described as poor,\nimpacting on the country low logistic performance. Papua is one of the region in\nIndonesia with high logistical barrier due to geographical challenge and poor\ninfrastructure ergo would hinder the vaccination effort of the province. TNI\u2019s\n(Indonesian Armed Force) military operation other than war (MOOTW) function,\nwith all its drawback, is explored as one solution in this research and would analyze\nthe role and potential if the option is chosen. Qualitative analysis shows that TNI\nwould have 3 roles during MOOTW, such as to provide logistical airlift of vaccine;\nto protect personnels and infrastructures involved in vaccination effort; and to serve\nas additional manpower in vaccination effort. TNI has the potential to answer these\nroles with the following operational costs and manpower (garrison) costs: Cost per\nFlight Hour (CPFH) for 2-dose target is at USD 576/flight hour and for 3-dose\ntarget is at USD 577/flight hour, requiring a garrison of a minimum of 280 soldiers\nand maximum 1400 soldiers (depends on the zone) for a one-day cycle per zone\nterritory.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK M.
