{"Nomor": 62651, "Judul": "FULLY KINETIC NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF A HALL THRUSTER USING LEAST SQUARES MOVING PARTICLE SEMI-IMPLICIT (LSMPS) METHOD", "Abstrak": "Nowadays, plasma simulation is one of the most developing physics and\nengineering disciplines. The growth is due to the increasing demand for low\nEarth Orbit (LEO) satellites and further space exploration using small satellites.\nThese satellites use the electric propulsion system, one of the plasma\napplications, because of its high efficiency and light weight. This thesis aims\nto understand the fundamental theories of plasma and learn how to model\nthem numerically. Therefore, this thesis focused on understanding previous\nplasma simulation models, developing the numerical model for plasma simulation,\nand applying the recently used particle-based method in the Faculty of\nMechanical and Aerospace Engineering Institut Teknologi Bandung (FMAE\nITB).\nHall thruster, one of the electric propulsion types, will be studied and\nnumerically simulated in this thesis. The main reference of this research is\nthe previous research work by [Szabo, 2001]. The simulation domain and\nnumerical models are also taken from Szabo\u2019s works. In his research, Szabo\nused a fully kinetic model to simulate all plasma particles (electrons, ions,\nand neutrals), and none of them were treated as fluid. The method that is\ncommonly used to conduct fully kinetic simulation is the Particle-in-Cell (PIC)\nmethod. This thesis will re-simulate the Hall thruster using the model which  Szabo proposed. The difference made in this thesis is in solving Poisson\u2019s\nequations to obtain electric field (E) by using the particle-based method. The\nparticle-based Least Squares Moving Particle Semi-implicit (LSMPS) method\nwill be used to replace the previous grid-based Finite Volume Method (FVM).\nLSPMS was introduced first time by [Koshizuka and Tamai, 2014] and has\nbeen used in some numerical simulation researches in FMAE ITB.\nThe results from this thesis will be used as a reference and base knowledge\nto conduct further plasma simulations. It will increase the capability of FMAE\nITB to do research in plasma simulations and be able to innovate in this field.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Edwin Aldrian Santoso": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/241255"}, "Penulis": "Edwin Aldrian Santoso [23620021]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Lavi Rizki Zuhal", "Poetro Lebdo Sambegoro, M.Sc., Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Fully kinetic, Hall thruster, LSMPS, Particle-in-Cell, PIC, Plasma, Satellites.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Jan 2022"}
