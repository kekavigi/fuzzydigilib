{"Nomor": 62935, "Judul": "CONFORMANCE CONTROL MECHANISM OF LOW ELASTIC POLYMER MICROSPHERES IN POROUS MEDIUM", "Abstrak": "Low elastic polymer microsphere (L-EPM) had been a promising conformance control agent with the wide application of polymer microspheres. The filtration loss characteristics, core damage and selective conformance control performance of L-EPM conformance control system were studied. The results showed that L-EPM system had less damage to the matrix core and the influence of filtration loss on conformance control treatment could be neglected in indoor experiments. When the high permeability layer was fixed, the larger the permeability ratio, the better the profile improve ability. For the cores with same permeability, water plugging rate of L-EPM system was much higher than that of oil plugging rate. For heterogeneous reservoirs with interlayer channeling, the plugging position of L-EPM determined the conformance control performance and the following oil recovery. L-EPM with good deformation and shear resistance had good adaptability to the conformance control treatment in heterogeneous reservoirs with interlayer channeling.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hongbin Yang [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Bobo Zhou", "Tongyu Zhu", "Pengxiang Wang", "Xiangfeng Zhang", "Tongyu Wang", "Feipeng Wu", "Liang Zhang", "Wanli Kang", "Yulia A.
