It is\ndriven by the rise of big data in various fields. Nowadays, Deep learning is\nthe most famous data-driven method used in wide range of application. In\nAerospace Engineering field, there are a lot of applications of deep learning\nsuch as in fluid mechanics. One of the biggest problem in fluid mechanics\nthat has not been completely solved is turbulence. With massive success of\ndeep learning in various real world problem, application of deep learning in\nturbulence modeling problem has became interesting research topic in recent\nyears. Reynolds-average Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence model is the most\nused technique in modeling turbulent flow for real world problem. The main\nproblem in RANS turbulence modeling is to obtain the closure relation that\nrelates the Reynolds stress to the mean flow properties. In this work, deep\nlearning is used to develop a model for turbulence closure modeling which\ngives the improvement from common turbulence model in computational fluid\ndynamics. There are two neural network architectures used to develop a neural\nnetwork model for calculating Reynolds stresses in square duct flow problem.\nThe first model is feed forward neural network (FFNN) and tensor basis neural\nnetwork (TBNN). The performance of these two model is compared with RANS\nk ?? model as the linear-eddy viscosity model. From the results of this work,\nit is shown that both neural network models could give better performance\non giving the closure prediction for turbulent in square duct flow and FFNN\nmodel proposed by the author could give the best closure prediction. Hence,\nthe utilization of deep learning in turbulence closure modeling for square duct\nflow problem could give improvement from the common CFD model.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Muhammad Ridho Alhafiz": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250238"}, "Penulis": "Muhammad Ridho Alhafiz [13618031]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Lavi Rizki Zuhal", "Pramudita Satria Palar, S.T., M.T., Ph.D.", "Gea Fardias Mu'", "min, S.T., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Data-Driven Turbulence Modeling;  Square Duct Flow.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Jun 2022"}
