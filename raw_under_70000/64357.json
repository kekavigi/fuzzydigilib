{"Nomor": 64357, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT OF ANALYTICAL METHOD FOR THE DETERMINATION OF BENZOIC ACID IN CHILI SAUCE", "Abstrak": "Benzoic acid is a food preservative which is more suitable for foods and drinks that are naturally in an acidic range. Chili sauce is used as a condiment into food to impart a particular flavor or enhance its flavor and may be preserved by benzoic acid. In some cases, benzoic acid could cause pseudo-allergic reactions. Cases of urticaria, asthma and anaphylactic shock have been also reported. Therefore, determination of benzoic acid in chili sauce is needed. Benzoic acid was extracted from chili sauce by liquid-liquid extraction using saturated sodium chloride solution and ethyl acetate at pH 2. Samples were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The separation of benzoic acid was performed on C18 coluirm with a mobile phase contains mixture of 0.1% acetic acid: methanol (50:50) at flow rate of 1.0mL/min with an injection volume of 20uL. The detection was set at wavelength of 254nm. Retention time and area under curve (AUC) of benzoic acid in sample were evaluated in system suitability test. Linearity test showed a linear regression equatiOn of y=10043x-2052 with coefficient of regression and variance of 0.998 and 1.07% respectively. The percentage of recovery was in the range of 84.53 \u2014 106.88%. Limit of detection and quantification was calculated from the linear regression data with the value of 2.246 ppm and 7.487ppm, respectively. The chromatographic method developed for the determination of benzoic acid in chili sauce fulfills the requirements for system suitability and validation test. The content of benzoic acid in commercial chili sauce samples were in a range of 0.18 - 51.44 ppm.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Vigneswari Sundrasagran": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246440"}, "Penulis": "Vigneswari Sundrasagran [10708703]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. rer. nat.
