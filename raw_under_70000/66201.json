A chemical injection method was developed using chemicals such as surfactants that aim to reduce the interfacial tension between the oil and the chemical solution that is injected. However, it is necessary to select surfactant criteria, including an aqueous stability test, phase behavior test, including interfacial tension testing. Interfacial tension testing is carried out with a spinning drop tensiometer and requires expensive costs. Huh (1979) developed an equation to predict interfacial tension values that effectively predict interfacial tension values around optimum salinity. However, the accuracy was very low when predicting interfacial tension in another salinity; therefore, the equation needs to be further developed for its refinement.\nIn this study, a modification of the Huh (1979) equation was carried out by considering the hydrophile-lipophile deviation (HLD), the interval of the multiplier constant in the HLD equation, and the equivalent alkane carbon number (EACN). Laboratory test results data from surfactant samples formulation-01A, formulation-01B, and formulation-01C were used. The calculation results are visualized by matching the graph between the interfacial tension values from the laboratory test and the modified Huh equation. The results show that the modification of Huh's equation is more effective in predicting interfacial tension because almost all data have error values below 50percent. This research proposed a value for CHO and n that depends on the salinity of each sample.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Dian Asfriany Nurfalah": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/250726"}, "Penulis": "Dian Asfriany Nurfalah [12218027]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. Rani Kurnia, S.Si., M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Perminyakan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "Mining & related operations", "Kata Kunci": "interfacial tension, HLD, EACN, lower optimum salinity, upper optimum salinity, CHO, n", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Suharsiyah", "File": "2 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Jun 2022"}
