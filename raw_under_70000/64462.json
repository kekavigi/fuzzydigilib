{"Nomor": 64462, "Judul": "VALIDATION METHOD OF PARA-PHENYLENEDIAMINE (PPD) IN HENNA USING UV-VIS SPECTROPHOTOMETRY", "Abstrak": "Para-phenylenediamine (PPD) is a commonly used chemical substance in henna preparations. New formulations are implemented for the so called natural henna. The main ingredient which is known as PPD acts to speed up the colouration process and it gives a dark colour. However, it akso acts as a.1\\ex%exix.c sabSkaack zspec:Na\\Xy towards dermal exposure. The aim of this research was to validate a method to analyze PPD content in henna using UV-Vis spectrophotometry. PPD stock solution was prepared and diluted to several concentrations. Ammonium sulphamate (0.5%\n2m1), hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite (0.2%) and naphtyl-ethylenediamine (NED) (0.1 %) were added to the solution to form a magenta colour in the interval of 2 minutes. Further, absorbance of the solution was measured at 528 nm. The diazotization reaction happened upon mixture in a range of temperature at 0 to 4\u00b0C. The solution was stable up to 5 minutes and the absorbance was measured. Method validation showed good linearity with a regression linear of y = 0.02107X + 0.0241 with regression coefficient of (r2) = 0.9991. Accuracy resulted a percentage recovery in a range of 93.34-96.89% for hair dye and 12.08-47.68% for hand dye. Average coefficient variance of hair dye and hand dye was 0.002138-1.385% respectively. PPD was identified to be present in hair dye but not in the hand dye. The proposed method shows good accuracy, precision and selectivity to determine the presence of PPD in henna.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK Amaresini A P Kanapathi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/246917"}, "Penulis": "Amaresini A P Kanapathi [10709702]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dr. rer. nat.
