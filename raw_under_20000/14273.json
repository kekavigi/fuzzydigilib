{"Nomor": 14273, "Judul": "NON LINEAR ANALYSIS FOR PIPE BENDS DUE TO PLASTIC LOAD", "Abstrak": "Pipe bends are very important components used in a piping system. So that it is important to understand the behavior of pipe bends. This paper presents the behaviors of pipe bends under a variety of loading conditions. The pipe bend used in this study is mildsteel that nominal size outside diameter of 2 inches, standardized in schedule 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80. Pipe bends angles, 90\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u201a\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0, geometry and material properties of pipes are main parameters in this analysis.The plastic finite element analysis has been carried out to evaluate plastic collapse loads of pipe bends. Three types of load were used in the simulations, internal pressure loading, in-plane and out-plane bending moment loading, and combined loading. Empirically, a pipe bend is made from three piping systems, a 90o bend and two equal length of straight pipe run terminating at stiff flanges. Each spacemen was loaded with an external load of sufficient magnitude to produce predominantly plastic collapse response. In-plane and out-plane loading were applied and the effect of internal pressure on the response was studied. The results of these analyses have been presented in the form of normalize pressure versus normalize moment plots, for each load case belonging to each model. The limit load of each case are obtained by normalize pressure-normalize moment curves. The effects of modeling parameters are also studied. The results obtained from small and large deformation are compared. A good agreement is obtained in an adequate manner by comparing theoretical, numerical, and experimental results.", "Daftar File": {"2007 TS PP KHAMTANH SANTISOUK 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/64438", "2007 TS PP KHAMTANH SANTISOUK 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/64439", "2007 TS PP KHAMTANH SANTISOUK 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/64440", "2007 TS PP KHAMTANH SANTISOUK 1-BAB 3A.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/64441", "2007 TS PP KHAMTANH SANTISOUK 1-BAB 3B.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/64442", "2007 TS PP KHAMTANH SANTISOUK 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/64443", "2007 TS PP KHAMTANH SANTISOUK 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/64444", "2007 TS PP KHAMTANH SANTISOUK 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/64445"}, "Penulis": "KHAMTANH SANTISOUK (NIM 23105023)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. IGN.
