{"Nomor": 15302, "Judul": "SPACE MISSION ANALYSIS AND DESIGN OF IiNUSAT-X", "Abstrak": "THE SPACE MISSION ANALYSIS AND DESIGN OF IINUSAT-X focuses    \n \n \n \n\non the preliminary definition of space missions,  determining the optimum mission profile to achieve the given objectives. The space mission analysis and design process in this thesis are carried out by utilizing a practical approach evolved over 40 years of space exploration described in the book Space Mission Analysis and Design (1). This process uses a set of specific algorithms and software tools (Satellite Tool Kit, AGI [2011]) that provide analysis capabilities required. IiNUSAT-X is designed as a nanosatellite, which have a mass of ten kilograms and cost satellite development of less than 1 Million U.S. Dollar (2). Configuration of IiNUSAT-X: hexagonal prism25 30 cm, body mounted solar panel, momentum bias control, and passive thermal control. Satellite will be launched piggyback in 2013 and has a low-Earth orbit (altitude = 700 km, inclination = 98.2 degree) to reduce launch costs as low as possible. With perturbation in that orbit, this satellite can stay in the orbit for a two-year minimum. This orbit gives tenminute access two times per day for all regions in Indonesia. Each ground segment can access the satellite in ten minutes. IiNUSAT-X will store and forward text data, which have 500 characters. This data can be transmitted in 9 seconds with 1200 bps. For communication bandwidth, IiNUSAT-X proposed to use UHF (435-438 MHz) at 3 MHz and VHF (144-146 MHz) of 2 MHz This communication involves three types of ground systems: portable transmitter, ground station participant and ground station control. This thesis is documenting the results of this iterative process. It was content clearly understanding and conveying the reasons for each decision that supported by quantitative data. This mission analysis and design are expected to give a contribution of an idea for development of satellite in Indonesia.", "Daftar File": {"2011 TA PP DEASY NATHALIA MANNURAGIE 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/70800", "2011 TA PP DEASY NATHALIA MANNURAGIE 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/70801", "2011 TA PP DEASY NATHALIA MANNURAGIE 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/70802", "2011 TA PP DEASY NATHALIA MANNURAGIE 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/70803", "2011 TA PP DEASY NATHALIA MANNURAGIE 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/70804", "2011 TA PP DEASY NATHALIA MANNURAGIE 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/70805", "2011 TA PP DEASY NATHALIA MANNURAGIE 1-BAB 6.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/70806", "2011 TA PP DEASY NATHALIA MANNURAGIE 1-BAB 7.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/70807", "2011 TA PP DEASY NATHALIA MANNURAGIE 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/70808"}, "Penulis": "DEASY NATHALIA MANNURAGIE (NIM : 13606063)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dosen Pembimbing  : Dr. Ridanto Eko Poetro"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "IiNUSAT, nanosatellite, Indonesian satellite, mission analysis, emergency communication relief.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "9 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Okt 2017"}
