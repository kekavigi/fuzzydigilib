{"Nomor": 18003, "Judul": "DECISION ANALYSIS TO MINIMIZE LEAKING PROBLEM OF GAS PLANT OPERATIONS AT PT. CPI IN ACHIEVING OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE", "Abstrak": "PT. CPI, in addition to producing oil, also produces gas from Gas Plants with total production 37.4 MMSCFD. Gas Plants often have unplanned shutdown due to leaking  problem on piping and equipment that total production loss in Bekasap GP and Petani GP is estimated 53.8 MMSCF or equivalent to 0.63 MM USD.       \n \n \n \n\nThe poor gas quality mostly caused by associate gas that has issues corrosion and lower heating value. If the associate gas is allowed to go to Flare, so it can minimize the leaking problem but has regulatory compliance issue. However, gas flaring will be evaluated and included as one of alternative solutions. The methodology used in the problem analysis is Kepner Tregoe, while in decision analysis using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) with Benefit, Cost, Opportunity, and Risk model. Under Benefit cluster comprises criteria of safety, operability, maintainability, effectiveness, and schedule. Under Cost cluster comprises of Capex and Opex criteria.        \n \n \n \n\nUnder Opportunity cluster consist of criteria such as improved gas quality and reduced purchased gas consumption. The latest is under Risk cluster consist of criteria such as project delay, end concession, decreasing gas flowrate, and regulatory compliance issue. Based on the AHP with BCOR model, resulting Benefits as the highest priority weight (0.54086), followed by Cost in the second priority (0.22978), Risks in the third place (0.15352), and Opportunities as the last priority (0.07584). Therefore, by substracting Benefit and Opportunity with Costs and Risks, the priority of alternative resulted are Flare        \n \n \n \n\nthe Associate Gas as the highest priority (0.366943) and followed by Inject Corrosion Inhibitor in the second priority (0.183259). Despite of Flare Associate Gas with BCOR method perspective is still feasible to run, it needs to consider the implementation period will depend on the applicable regulations. So the strategy that will be done is to apply the second  alternative that is Inject Corrosion Inhibitor.        \n \n \n \n\nThe limitation in this research is the AHP was assumed to be indepent among cluster and criteria. So, the researches opportunities that can be done in the future are performing Analytic Network Process to have interdependent among cluster and criteria; and compare the AHP result conducted by semi qualitative with further quantitative study analysis.", "Daftar File": {"2015 TS PP ANNA LUCKY MERIDIANA ZALUCHU 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/87119", "2015 TS PP ANNA LUCKY MERIDIANA ZALUCHU 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/87120", "2015 TS PP ANNA LUCKY MERIDIANA ZALUCHU 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/87121", "2015 TS PP ANNA LUCKY MERIDIANA ZALUCHU 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/87122", "2015 TS PP ANNA LUCKY MERIDIANA ZALUCHU 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/87123", "2015 TS PP ANNA LUCKY MERIDIANA ZALUCHU 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/87124"}, "Penulis": "ANNA LUCKY MERIDIANA ZALUCHU (NIM: 29112457)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Ir.
