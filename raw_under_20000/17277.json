{"Nomor": 17277, "Judul": "DUCT WATER CURRENT TURBINE AND EXTREMELY LOW HEAD HELICAL TURBINE", "Abstrak": "This research introduced for the duct Water Current Turbine Triple Helix with very low head less than 2m and water current at river or in the ocean, economical ecological use for small hydro power rating between 100 to 1000 kW still represent an unsolved problem. Unlike  \n \n\nconventional hydro installation, water current turbine in open flow and generate power from flowing water with almost zero in environmental impact. Developments in water current turbine design are review and some potential advantages of duct or \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u201cdiffuser augmented\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u201d current turbine  \n \n\nand extremely low head turbine will be explored. For the output expected from the project is helical turbine with control flow on duct.  \n \n\nThe research aims to apply the helical turbine inside the duct to find the parameter of the power coefficient against tip speed ratio \u03bb, pitch angle and twist angle y which is also the optimum parameter to design a helical cross flow turbine with duct. Parameters obtained from  \n \n\nnumerical simulation and through the experimental result.  \n \n\nNumerical simulation using a model k-\u03b5 and simulate circumstances steady for the velocity 4.43 m/s and also unsteady condition with the velocity that we have measured from the experimental. The results from the Cp values obtained from the each type of turbine is 43% for the twist angle 60 degree, 45% for 90 degree and 46% for the twist angle 120 degree. However, for the velocity 1.5 m/s in unsteady condition the result of Cp is 0.08 for the twist angle 60 degree, 9.5% for 90 degree and 8.3% for the twist angle 120 degree.  \n \n\nThe turbine has tested using the duct system made in fluid machinery lab with three types of twist angle 60 degree, 90 degree and 120 degree. Test results from the Cp values obtained from the each type of turbine are 0.85% for twist angle 60 degree, 1.2% for 90 degree and 2.2% for 120 degree with the velocity 0.5 to 2 m/s.  \n \n\nThe subject was designed and expected at velocity 4.43 m/s, but in the real experiment, the system that we made in the lab can create about 0.5 m/s to 2 m/s and the turbine itself did not design for the low velocity and inconstant flow. So the result from the experiment was very low in coefficient. However, in the condition like this, we can improve the performance of the turbine by increasing the side of the blade (bigger blade side), which can be run in the low velocity. If the area of the blade increases, so it also increases the area of the turbine to absorb the power from the water.  \n \n\nHaving thoroughly analyzed the duct water turbine, there are still some works to do that we have to improve in getting the experimental data in the future works, such as:  \n \n\n1. Test the other model which is good in quality and suitable with the system condition that  \n \n\nwe had made in fluid machinery lab.  \n \n\n2. Prove the model by running it in the free stream flow (Current water river)", "Daftar File": {"2009 TS PP SOUNTHISACK PHOMMACHANH 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/82608", "2009 TS PP SOUNTHISACK PHOMMACHANH 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/82609", "2009 TS PP SOUNTHISACK PHOMMACHANH 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/82610", "2009 TS PP SOUNTHISACK PHOMMACHANH 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/82611", "2009 TS PP SOUNTHISACK PHOMMACHANH 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/82612", "2009 TS PP SOUNTHISACK PHOMMACHANH 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/82613", "2009 TS PP SOUNTHISACK PHOMMACHANH 1-BAB 6.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/82614", "2009 TS PP SOUNTHISACK PHOMMACHANH 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/82615"}, "Penulis": "SOUNTHISACK PHOMMACHANH (NIM : 23107031)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing  : Dr. Ir.
