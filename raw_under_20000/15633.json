{"Nomor": 15633, "Judul": "NEWTONIAN AND NON-NEWTONIAN FLOWS IN SLIGHTLY TAPERED TUBE FINAL PROJECT", "Abstrak": "The phenomenon of Newtonian and Non-Newtonian flows both in straight and slightly tapered tube is abundant to be found in our surrounding, basically almost all kind of fluids flowing within a rigid pipe is the representation of the flows in straight tube, while the condensation process occurring to the flows in the pipe represents the flows in slightly tapered tube.  \n \n\nThis final project studies the behavior of two kinds of fluids, which are the Newtonian and the Non-Newtonian, with Power Law as the example of the Non-Newtonian one, each in both straight and slightly tapered tube. For the Newtonian fluid the initial tools for the modeling is the momentum and the continuity equation, that will be analyzed mathematically to find the relation between the pressure drop and the volume flow rate in the straight tube. The case of slightly tapered tube is not much different, only that we should apply the lubrication approximation (magnitude order analysis) to be able to get the reduced form of the momentum and continuity equations, so that we can generalize the characteristic of the velocity of the flow in the tube itself, and in the end we can mathematically analyze the flow rate of the system. Continuing with the Power Law fluid, we perform the similar steps. In the end we can see that actually for each fluid the volume flow rate formula was basically similar to the one in straight tube, only that here we have it multiplied by the taper correction factor due to the change of the tube\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s radius.", "Daftar File": {"2011 TA PP FARAH FITRIANA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/72669", "2011 TA PP FARAH FITRIANA 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/72668", "2011 TA PP FARAH FITRIANA 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/72673", "2011 TA PP FARAH FITRIANA 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/72672", "2011 TA PP FARAH FITRIANA 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/72671", "2011 TA PP FARAH FITRIANA 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/72670"}, "Penulis": "FARAH FITRIANA  (NIM : 10105008)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Agus Yodi Gunawan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Newtonian, Non-Newtonian, Power Law, Slightly Tapered Tube, Lubrication Approximation, Magnitude Order Analysis, Pipa Menyempit, Aproksimasi Lubrikasi, Analisis Orde Suku-suku", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "6 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
