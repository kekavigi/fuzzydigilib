{"Nomor": 12078, "Judul": "SYNTHESIS OF POLY(GLUCOSE-1B-ETHYLACRYLATE) AND ITS COPOLYMER WITH DERIVATIVE VINYL MONOMERS", "Abstrak": "Since more people are environmentally aware, now a day many researchers try to synthesize new bio-harmless materials for numerous industrial consumer materials that are derived from monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. For those reasons, synthetic polymers from vinyl saccharides are being increasingly explored. Vinyl saccharides are already known as raw material for copolymers which will give novel materials properties like biocompatibility, biodegradability, hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity balance and skin compatibility. Vinyl saccharides can be synthesized using chemical or enzymatic reaction routes. Synthesis methods using chemical routes are complicated by the requirement for several protection and deprotection steps resulting from the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups of similar reactivity in order to obtain the desired product with appropriate region- and stereoselectivity. Synthesis methods using enzymatic reactions are more preferable because these synthesis techniques are highly selective (stereo-, regio-, and chemoselective) and the use of normal conditions (ambient temperature and pressure) and make the addition of inhibitor unnecessary.", "Daftar File": {"ABSTRAK ERYTHRINA STAVILA (NIM: 20508010)": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/168313", "COVER ERYTHRINA STAVILA (NIM: 20508010)": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/168314", "BAB1 ERYTHRINA STAVILA (NIM: 20508010)": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/168315", "BAB2 ERYTHRINA STAVILA (NIM: 20508010)": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/168316", "BAB3 ERYTHRINA STAVILA (NIM: 20508010)": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/168317", "BAB4 ERYTHRINA STAVILA (NIM: 20508010)": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/168318", "BAB5 ERYTHRINA STAVILA (NIM: 20508010)": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/168319", "PUSTAKA ERYTHRINA STAVILA (NIM: 20508010)": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/168320"}, "Penulis": "ERYTHRINA STAVILA (NIM: 20508010)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. I Made Arcana, Wouter Kloosterman, Drs., dan Dr. Katja Loos"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Enzymatic Reaction, Radical Polymerization, Redox Initiator", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Vika Anastasya Kovariansi \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "8 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
