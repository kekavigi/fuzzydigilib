{"Nomor": 10624, "Judul": "MECHANICAL PROPERTIES ANALYSIS OF WET LAMINATION NEW HYBRID COMPOSITE MATERIALS", "Abstrak": "Advancements in composite technologies have been using intensively in the aerospace and aviation industry. The advantages offered by composites, namely high strength and light weight, have made them natural substitute for structures and components on aircraft, automotive and naval and land systems. The increase in the number of composite applications, coupled with more technological advancements than ever estimated, has fueled industry growth. Among of the family of composite material is fiber metal laminates. To support the need of the industries for this material, study and research have been carried out to improve the performance and to develop family of fiber metal laminates such as GLARE, ARALL and CARE. Realizing the contribution of fiber metal laminates is huge towards the development of the aviation, marine and automotive industries, this thesis will focus on the study of mechanical properties of a new hybrid material consisting of aluminum, Kevlar/epoxy and Glass/epoxy layers. The main objective is to establish the material data base and produce a new hybrid material with reasonable performance with the dry lay up method. The performance data of this material will be compared to the existing data that was presented by E.C Botelho for GLARE. To date the entire hybrid materials are layer by the dry lay up method, and give a small spacing for the wet lay up method will invite a lot of comments from the expertise or manufacturers. The analysis of the wet lay up method aimed to seek the possibility of replacing dry lay up method in manufacturing the fiber metal laminates.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "HUSRI BIN HUSAIN (NIM 23604711)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Ir.
