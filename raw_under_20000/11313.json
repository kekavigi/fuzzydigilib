{"Nomor": 11313, "Judul": "DICLOFENAC AND ZAFIRLUKAST SUPPRESS THE ANXIOLYTIC ACTION OF DIAZEPAM", "Abstrak": "Stress has become an unavoidable phenomenon in our daily life. Stress has several negative effects on our health. There are two main systems involved in stress mechanism: the sympathetic adrenal medullary (SAM) and the hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) system. Previous studies have also shown the involvement of arachidonic acid cascade in stress. The aim of this study was to further investigate the role of several pathways of arachidonic acid cascade in stress. Male Wistar rats were tested on elevated plus maze (EPM) following diazepam administration. The role of arachidonic acid cascade was studied by pretreatment of diclofenac (a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor) and zafirlukast (an antagonist of cysteinyl leukotrienes receptor). In order to study brain level changes accompanying the treatments, the astrocytes in brain hippocampal slices were examined. Rats that were given diazepam showed increase both in percentage of open arm entries and time spent in the open arms that were significantly different compared to control group (p", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "R.
