{"Nomor": 18039, "Judul": "ANALYSIS AND PROPOSED OF PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT SYSTEM FRAMEWORK AT MINISTRY OF ESDM", "Abstrak": "From 2010 until 2012, LAKIP\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s (Laporan Akuntabilitas Kinerja Instansi Pemerintah) evaluation result for the Ministry of ESDM (Energy dan Sumber Daya Mineral) is Good (B) and received an award as one of 10 ministries with the best evaluation. In the real life, as well as public reporting, respond about national ESDM management continuously being at a spotlight, especially related to fuel subsidies, alternative energy sources, imported fuel, and electricity, as well as BUMN (Badan Usaha Milik Negara) as an implementer and manager. Public dissatisfaction was also seen in the distribution management of fuel and energy, especially in the areas that was far from the central government, where in some places there is fuel scarcity occured. The accuracy rate of electrification is also questioned.    \n \n \n \n\nOne factor that enabled this contradiction, in which the Ministry gets a good rating in the LAKIP\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s evaluation, but the national ESDM management continued gain spotlighted, is that false alarm phenomenon occured inside Ministry of ESDM.    \n \n \n \n\nThe PMS of ESDM Ministry then analyzed through four stages in performance management systems designs. By following the steps for PMS design, the PMS analysis was begin with information collection. This information was represent the internal and external condition of the ministry. Three among all of the problem in the PMS of Ministry of ESDM are, The PMS (Performance Measurement System) of the Ministry of ESDM doesn\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019t have a specific framework., KPI not thorough at every level in the organization, and KPI is just a target about national energy and mineral resources sector.    \n \n \n \n\nThe inexistence of framework forcing the PMS of Ministry to have only single perspective, that is used to measure the performance of the organization. This is affected the coverage to the internal organization. The implementation of such framework ultimately resulted in the form of inconsistent performance indicators on describe the internal organization condition. And it is well known that in the performance management system, performance indicators serve as organizational performance reference. Thus, while the national ESDM target sector successfully achieved, but the internal performance of the organization stands undefined.    \n \n \n \n\nBoth of these conditions lead to difficulties to ministry in thoroughly evaluate and monitor their own performance. The organization orientation would be focused on the values that does not reflect the real performance of the ministry, or the national ESDM management. And the KPI of PMS did not reach every level in the organizations.    \n \n \n \n\nAnalysis implemented to see the fittest framework to be implemented in the ministry\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s PMS. Considering the condition of ministry of ESDM, level of knowledge on designing PMS, the easiest literature to get, and organizations to be benchmarked, the proposed framework to be applied in the ministries of ESDM is the balanced scorecard. One ultimate advantage of Balanced scorecards, is because Balanced scorecards comprise a strategy map of objectives, and a scorecards of measures, targets, and initiatives, in which truly applicable in the field of non-profit organizations.    \n \n \n \n\nAfter the framework was set, analysis implemented to see the fittest perspective. As a public sector, with multi stakeholder related to Energy & Mineral Resources, the financial perspective was transformed in to stake-holder perspectives, and stand on the top of the hierarchy. The current KPI then analyzes to see the relation with the vision/ mission statement. The design and formulation for ministry\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s strategy-map, resulted that the KPI will grouped into 16 objectives contained Measurement Indicator. The objectives then grouped into 3 strategic themes, that is Public-Private Partnership, Energy Avaibility, and National Empowerment, as an effort to achieve the organization goals.", "Daftar File": {"2012 TS PP ARIA SURAWIJAYA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/87358", "2012 TS PP ARIA SURAWIJAYA 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/87359", "2012 TS PP ARIA SURAWIJAYA 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/87360", "2012 TS PP ARIA SURAWIJAYA 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/87361", "2012 TS PP ARIA SURAWIJAYA 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/87362", "2012 TS PP ARIA SURAWIJAYA 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/87363"}, "Penulis": "ARIA SURAWIJAYA (NIM: 29109378)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Prof. Dr. Ir.
