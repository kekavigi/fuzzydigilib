{"Nomor": 11127, "Judul": "PRODUCTION OF DRY BAKER'S YEAST", "Abstrak": "The production of dried baker's yeast has been carried out by laboratorium scale spray dryer. The effect of drying temperature and feed flow rate to viability and vitality of yeast was studied. The drying temperature was varied from 70 degrees C to 90 degrees C, while the feed flow rate was varied from 100 mL/hr to 200 mL/hr. The optimum temperature was 70 degrees C. The optimum feed flow rate was 200 mL/hr. The result of water content examination yielding percentage of water content between 2%-7%. The result is comparable to the commercial one yielding 2.4% water content. The effects of drying temperature and feed flow rate to vitality of the yeast are presented in 3D modeling.", "Daftar File": {"2008 TA PP PATRICIA STEFANIE 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/44307"}, "Penulis": "PATRICIA STEFANIE (NIM 13004072)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Ronny Purwadi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Viability, Vitality, Water content", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Rizki Aprianti \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
