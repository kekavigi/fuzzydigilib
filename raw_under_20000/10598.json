{"Nomor": 10598, "Judul": "COMMUNITY-BASED NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT: THE IMPLEMENTATION OF COLLABORATIVE PLANNING IN BOTSWANA AND INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "This research is about Community-based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) related to the implementation of collaborative planning. In order to find out how collaborative planning perspective can contribute to the implementation of CBNRM concept, three indicators are used: public participation, local institutions, and government policy. It also seeks for failure and success factors of implementation of CBNRM in Botswana and Indonesia.Botswana still faces the problems of rural poverty. It has low population\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u201a\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2013land resource ratios and its government has taken seriously the devolution of powers to manage natural resources since the mid-1980s. This has involved CBNRM initiatives since 1990 as part of a Southern African Development Community (SADC) regional program funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), focusing mainly on wildlife and tourism. Indonesia as the second study case has a very large number of local ethnic communities, many still dependent on local forest and marine resources for their livelihoods. Those local forest and marine resources became the main focus of the CBNRM project in Indonesia started in 1990s.This research concludes that Botswana can be said to be more succeed in terms of having national CBNRM forum and clear organization structure of CBNRM and is trying to finalize its policy on CBNRM. However, all in all Botswana and Indonesia share almost the same experience in CBNRM regarding collaborative planning perspective. Public participations in both countries are in the stage of symbolic participation and real participation, and some are in manipulation stage. Meanwhile, local institutions exist in CBNRM practice in both countries. They are actively and effectively involved in their environment and even empower themselves as one of main point of CBNRM. Finally, Botswana and Indonesia do not have special laws of CBNRM. Yet, they have sectoral and local regulations that support the practice of natural resource management by community.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "HENNY RAMAYANI (NIM 25406016)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. Femke Niekerk (RuG, The Netherlands) dan Ir.
