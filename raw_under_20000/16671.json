{"Nomor": 16671, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT OF 2D OBSERVATIONAL OPTICAL MOTION TRACKING MEASUREMENT SYSTEM FOR HUMAN GAIT ANALYSIS", "Abstrak": "Study of human motion is of interest to many researchers, and has a broad application in the field such as medical diagnostics (Orthotic and Prosthetic Design). Information about position and orientation of various joints of patient\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s body is needed in determining abnormalities. It is an important tool helping a physician or therapist pinpoints the abnormalities. Also, it could be used to monitor a patient\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s response to therapeutic intervention, such as physiotherapy after stroke, the evaluation of the prosthetic joint replacement and physical therapy of joint disease. At present, many commercial optical motion systems that could be used for medical rehabilitation are available; however such benefits come at a price and may not be within the budget of most hospitals. This work presents development of an optical motion capture systems for 2D clinical gait analysis. The system consists of a video camera with maximum speed of 90 fps, LED markers, PC and technical computing software, which are used for capturing and processing the digital image of markers attached to human body during motion. In the experiments, a person is instructed to walk in a specially arranged measurement area. The recorded images are then digitally processed to detect the markers using image binarization method and track the markers\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019 position using least distance method. The experiment is carefully set-up to ensure that the image processing program could track the markers\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019 motion and the results could be calibrated properly. The system developed in this work is able to automatically track the markers movement and overcome the overlapping problem by a relatively simple technique. The marker positions data obtained from experiment has been used for further kinematics and kinetics analyses.", "Daftar File": {"2010 TS PP NDARU JULIYAD 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/79008", "2010 TS PP NDARU JULIYAD 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/79009", "2010 TS PP NDARU JULIYAD 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/79010", "2010 TS PP NDARU JULIYAD 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/79011", "2010 TS PP NDARU JULIYAD 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/79012", "2010 TS PP NDARU JULIYAD 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/79013", "2010 TS PP NDARU JULIYAD 1-BAB 6.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/79014", "2010 TS PP NDARU JULIYAD 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/79015"}, "Penulis": "NDARU JULIYAD (NIM : 23608008)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Tim Pembimbing : Dr. Ir.
