{"Nomor": 14035, "Judul": "WELL ABANDONING, THE CYCLE CONTINUES: CASE STUDY FIELD X, WELL 4", "Abstrak": "Every living creature has their very own life cycle: born, growth, and death. These are also applied to all oil, gas, and geothermal wells. Starting from the drilling of the well, the production of the reservoir fluids, and finally the plugging and the abandonment of the well.During the life cycle, wells will eventually encounter problems. These problems might be caused by many aspects including cement problems, wrong casing setting depth selection, compaction, and formation subsidence and this has happened to one of the wells at the X field, Indonesia.The solution recommended for the company is plug and abandon using polymer injection, pressure activated sealant and squeeze cementing. Polymers will be used to displace formation fluid before cement enters the annulus. Leaking casings will be repaired by using pressure activated sealant. The cement used for the abandoning practice will be an expanding cement which has been added with pure MgO or CaO.", "Daftar File": {"2011 TA PP BAMBANG CAHYONIARSO 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/62824"}, "Penulis": "BAMBANG CAHYONIARSO (NIM 12206036)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr-Ing.
