{"Nomor": 19003, "Judul": "SELF MILAR ARCHITECTURE OF TREES", "Abstrak": "Tree structure is one of natural optimal transport network. It has also been shown by diferent formulation that optimal transport networks take tree-like structure. By using construction material as minimum as possible, a tree does not just simply span its branches to provide an ability to capture maximum light, but also it has to be mechanically stable. Based on the Gilbert-Steiner optimum network problem, we constructed a growing tree model to characterize the self-similarity of branching network in tree. A non-growing model based on random walkis also constructed as a comparison to the growing model. By considering three diferent value of      , it is shown that the growing tree structure exhibit diferent pattern at diferent range of which are 0  1. Self-similarity is observed at 0  1, the average length of branch is found to be unusual. By the comparison, which is very dificult for 0 < \n< 1 and           \n> 1, it is shown that at = 1, there is no qualitative difierent between the growing model and the non-growing model..", "Daftar File": {"2014 TS PP MUHAMMAD RIZQIE ARBIE 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/94402", "2014 TS PP MUHAMMAD RIZQIE ARBIE 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/94403", "2014 TS PP MUHAMMAD RIZQIE ARBIE 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/94404", "2014 TS PP MUHAMMAD RIZQIE ARBIE 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/94405", "2014 TS PP MUHAMMAD RIZQIE ARBIE 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/94406", "2014 TS PP MUHAMMAD RIZQIE ARBIE 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/94407"}, "Penulis": "MUHAMMAD RIZQIE ARBIE Pembimbing: Christophe ELOY", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Christophe ELOY"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Model, Tree, Optimal network, Growing, Non-growing, Cost, Minimization. i", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "6 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
