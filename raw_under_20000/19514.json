There are more people who are competing in creating something new and also more people who want to try such new technologies. Apple Inc. is the first hardware and software company in terms of the innovations done by a company. Since 2009, the total of hardware and software sales did increased. However, Apple's financial statement indicates the declined sales in the third quarter of 2011. Apple iOS application provide the best attraction that user can get from a          \n\nsmartphone. By developing new method in creating application, there will be more application developers, variation of applications and hardware sales are expected. Based on the data have been collected from books and several secondary data, the author does the analysis and development of software applications on a non Mac laptop. Some constraints encountered during the application creating process, especially in less stable of the operating system in non Mac laptop that has been installed with Mac operating system.

The software that created distributed in iTunes which user can directly use it with the help of iTunes for installation. Author makes a contact with Apple representative, and then author will propose the new method by this year. The use of Integrated Design Environment (IDE) for cross platform can gives the opportunity of the Windows user to be able to feel the advantages that were previously only available for Mac users. Thus, this alternative method is capable of providing an example of the growing Apple market opportunities to sell more hardware and software.", "Daftar File": {"2012 TS PP SURYA AGUNG WIBAWA HARTONO 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/98166", "2012 TS PP SURYA AGUNG WIBAWA HARTONO 1-BAB 1A.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/98167", "2012 TS PP SURYA AGUNG WIBAWA HARTONO 1-BAB 1B.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/98168", "2012 TS PP SURYA AGUNG WIBAWA HARTONO 1-BAB 2A.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/98169", "2012 TS PP SURYA AGUNG WIBAWA HARTONO 1-BAB 2B.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/98170", "2012 TS PP SURYA AGUNG WIBAWA HARTONO 1-BAB 3A.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/98171", "2012 TS PP SURYA AGUNG WIBAWA HARTONO 1-BAB 3B.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/98172", "2012 TS PP SURYA AGUNG WIBAWA HARTONO 1-BAB 3C.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/98173", "2012 TS PP SURYA AGUNG WIBAWA HARTONO 1-BAB 3D.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/98174", "2012 TS PP SURYA AGUNG WIBAWA HARTONO 1-BAB 3E.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/98175", "2012 TS PP SURYA AGUNG WIBAWA HARTONO 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/98176", "2012 TS PP SURYA AGUNG WIBAWA HARTONO 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/98177"}, "Penulis": "SURYA AGUNG WIBAWA HARTONO (NIM: 29109355)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing :  A.
