{"Nomor": 11509, "Judul": "EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF A TWIN-SHAFT TURBOCHARGER BASED MICROTURBINE POWER PLANT", "Abstrak": "The concept of Distributed Generation (DG) has inspires the development of microturbine in many countries because of many benefits offered by microturbine system such as low emission engine with the minimum maintenance and fuel flexibility. Microturbine technology is still involving high investment cost. Here, the concept of turbocharger based microturbine emerges. The use of commercial-mass produced automobile turbocharger will greatly reduce the investment cost.For this microturbine research the twin-shaft gas turbine arrangement is adapted and the gas generator section has been successfully made. Continuing from earlier development, the prototype is continued with the three main processes that is selecting and develop the free power turbine, design and develop the power transmission system and electrical system.Prototyping of the twin-shaft microturbine system is done twice.The first prototype is the first successful microturbine prototype but with a poor performance. The first prototype can produce maximum output power around 20 watts with the system thermal efficiency 0.07%. The first prototype is evaluated and has been used as the improvement for the second prototype. Unfortunately the second prototype has not been finished yet because the difficulty of bigger system starting. The twin-shaft microturbine power plant system based on turbocharger is a proven technology, as the research continues it can be produced another prototype with good performance.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "TETUKO KURNIAWAN (NIM 13103017)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. Ir.
