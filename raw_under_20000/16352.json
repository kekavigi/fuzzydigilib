{"Nomor": 16352, "Judul": "THE USE OF LOW SPEED ELECTRICAL RUNOUT FOR COMPENSATION OF PROXIMITY MEASUREMENT AT HIGH ROTATIONAL SPEED", "Abstrak": "Among various vibration monitoring techniques, orbit is used to measure the movement of shaft centerline. This orbit also gives important information for investigating the reason of fluid bearing malfunction. The orbit sometimes does not describe the real dynamic motion of the shaft and this condition may lead to wrong information when the runout is significance. Thus, the aim of this research is to investigate whether a runout data collected at low rational speed can be used as a compensation for data collected at high rotational speed. To fulfill the aim of this research, the first step starts from static calibration which is to check the linearity of the displacement sensors in static case. Dynamic calibration at \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u0192 = 30-1000 Hz is also done to check frequency response of displacement sensor at \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u0192 = 30- 1000 Hz. Then this experiment will move to another dynamic calibration within another range. Another dynamic calibration is carried out. It is used to check phase of displacement sensor within range of frequency \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u0192 = 1-30 Hz. The combination of result of dynamic calibration is also performed to check frequency response from \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u0192 = 1-1000 Hz. Then this experiment is continued to the next step. Next, the comparison of static and dynamic is also done to verify sensitivity between static and dynamic case. Mechanical runout measurement is also performed at different position of dial indicator to measure the mechanical runout and to find a good plane for sensor position. Then bearing housing vibration measurement is done to assess how small of bearing housing vibration compared to the total runout. The last step, the main experiment is carry out to investigate the runout by measuring in four different speeds before go to the conclusion of the research. According to the result of the research, there is very little different between runout at low and high speed. Thus, the runout collected at low rotational speed can be used as compensation for data collected at high rotational speed.", "Daftar File": {"2011 TS PP MAO SOTHEARITH 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/76952", "2011 TS PP MAO SOTHEARITH 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/76953", "2011 TS PP MAO SOTHEARITH 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/76954", "2011 TS PP MAO SOTHEARITH 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/76955", "2011 TS PP MAO SOTHEARITH 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/76956", "2011 TS PP MAO SOTHEARITH 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/76957", "2011 TS PP MAO SOTHEARITH 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/76958"}, "Penulis": "MAO SOTHEARITH (NIM : 23109023)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dosen Pembimbing  : Dr. Ir.
