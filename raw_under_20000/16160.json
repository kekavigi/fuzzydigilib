Genethics Algorithm can resolve the problem of \n\nmulti-criteria and multi-objective which modeled by processes and evolutionary biology. Genethics algorithm \n\nwork with a population consisting of individuals, the each of individual presents a possible solution to the \n\nexisting problems by the having fitness value. In this reseach, the calculation of fitness value is determined by \n\nthree factors, i.e., the classroom should not be smaller than the number of students, at the same class there are no \n\ncourses that take place at the same time with the prerequisite courses, and teacher should not teach more than \n\nfour clock ongoing. At the same time, teacher should not be taught in different classes, the classroom should not \n\nbe used more than one class, and classes and courses in the same semester should not be scheduled are not \n\nincluded in determining the value of fitness because they have become a necessity in the scheduling. The results \n\nof the research came to the conclusion that the time needed to schedule a particular semester, is not only \n\ndetermined by the parameter of genetics but is determined by the the fitness value from the convergence of the \n\nschedule and the number of individu who are raised in a population.", "Daftar File": {"proceedings knsi 2014 full edition(65).pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/75869"}, "Penulis": "Jasman Pardede, Asep Nana Hermana", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["#CONTRIBUTOR#"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "schedule, genethics algorithm, individu, population, fitness value.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Mar 2014"}
