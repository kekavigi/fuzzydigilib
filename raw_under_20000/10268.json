{"Nomor": 10268, "Judul": "PLANNING SYSTEM ON THE DUTCH AND INDONESIAN MINERAL PLANNING: What is the optimal approach?", "Abstrak": "The study concerns the planning system on the mineral planning based on government and market approach. The case studies are mining policy in the Netherlands and Indonesia. The locus of the study is to analyze the mineral planning system in both the Netherlands and Indonesia from government and market approaches' point of view. To analyze the mineral planning system, several criteria for optimal land use on the mineral planning are needed. Sustainability, justice, and efficiency criteria are used to elaborate the mineral planning system in this research.The Netherlands, based on its geology, has limited mineral resources and they are distributed unevenly. The richer area is located in the southern part of this country. Governmental involvement on minerals can be seen in shifting of mineral policy in the Netherlands. The shifting in mineral planning policy was based on the issue which faced on excavation activities in this country, interregional and European trans-boundary issue. The regional government functions as authorized institution for granting the excavation permit. The market-oriented approach has shaped the mineral policy in the Netherlands lately rather than governmentoriented approach.Indonesia seems to have no problems in fulfilling its mineral requirements even though not all regions are able to fulfill their material needs. Indonesian geological condition makes this country has variety and huge amounts of mineral resources. Some environmental and investment issues arise regarding mining activities in certain area. The issues are triggered by decentralized governmental systems in Indonesia is not followed by new mining regulation. Based on Indonesian regulation, the local government has authority in ranting permit issue in its local quarrying site. It will be task of provincial government if the mining location is trans-locals and central government will take the responsibility for trans-provincial location. The market approach still becomes orientation of mineral planning policy in Indonesia during the last 30 years.The sustainability, justice, and efficiency criteria are in analyzing the mineral planning system in the Netherlands and Indonesia. Since the Netherlands has adopted market-oriented in its mineral planning approach, there is declining in sustainability of minerals. The declining is seen from cancelling several parts of the National Structure Plan on Surface Raw Materials which related to attain sustainable minerals. From the beginning, sustainable mineral is not clearly stated in Indonesian policy. The right of landowners to refuse the research of potential minerals in Indonesia is stronger than the Netherlands. From the investment side, the unjust treatment between domestic and foreign company occur in Indonesia. Otherwise, the similar treatment of mining companies occurs in the Dutch mineral planning. Granting excavation permission in Indonesia is more efficient than the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, it may need more than 10 years to get excavation permission while it is only some month in Indonesia.Finally, there are some notes for getting optimal mineral planning system for the Netherlands and Indonesia. The study recommends that the Netherlands has to keep its sustainable mineral concept like its previous regulation. The Netherlands has to improve the efficiency in granting excavation permit. Sustainable mineral should state clearly in Indonesian mineral regulation which is never stated before. To encourage the foreign investment, the role of domestic and foreign mining company has to be similar in Indonesia mineral planning.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "DODI JULI HENDRI (NIM 25406042)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Prof. Dr. Ir.
