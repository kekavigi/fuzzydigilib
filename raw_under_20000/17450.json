Oxy-hydrogen (HHO) was used as an additive fuel to find the effect on performance and emission at idle speed with low load. The results indicated that the performance and the exhaust gas emissions depending on the operating parameters of the engine and the fuel. However, air/fuel ratio value (\u03bb) is most importantly placed on CO, NOX and HC emissions. The effect of HHO as a fuel additive for ethanol and gasoline blended fuels in SI engines and the techniques used to produce hydrogen from water by electro-chemical processes on hydrogen generators to connect them to vehicles directly in the car were observed that by slightly reducing fuel consumption of ethanol\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2013gasoline any blends and increased thermal efficiency, reduced emissions.", "Daftar File": {"2011 TS PP TRAN THANH BINH 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/83527", "2011 TS PP TRAN THANH BINH 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/83528", "2011 TS PP TRAN THANH BINH 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/83529", "2011 TS PP TRAN THANH BINH 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/83530", "2011 TS PP TRAN THANH BINH 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/83531", "2011 TS PP TRAN THANH BINH 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/83532", "2011 TS PP TRAN THANH BINH 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/83533"}, "Penulis": "TRAN THANH BINH (NIM : 23109022)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Committee members: Dr. Ir.
