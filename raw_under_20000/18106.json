{"Nomor": 18106, "Judul": "COMPETITIVE STRATEGY PLAN OF SUPPLY CAPABILITY FOR SUSTAINABLE ELECTRICITY BUSINESS (CASE STUDY:PT KRAKATAU DAYA LISTRIK)", "Abstrak": "Within the year since 2012 until 2015 PT Krakatau Daya Listrik (KDL) has a very high demand growth of electricitythat never occurred in the past.Cumulatively, there is a 365.8 MVA at the end of year 2015 or around 25% of current connection capacity of customers. It comes mostly from non-KS and Groups. This demand growth is a great opportunity and very important for KDL to have a significant growth in line with its Growth Strategy that has been determined, and should KDL fail to grab this opportunity, the sustainability of KDL\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s business in electricity will be weakened and threatened.Nevertheless, the problem currently happened is the shortage of competitive supply due to inadequate capacity, lack of technology, uncompetitive production cost, and limited and uneconomical fuel use of the existing electricity facility. According to the current condition of the existing electricity facility, it cannot be relied on grabbing the opportunity optimally.     \n \n \n \n\nThe solution to grab the opportunity proposed in this study is an improvement of electricity supply capability by building a new competitive supply capability. It needs a comprehensive study to define the specification of electricity source and the funding model to be used. The process of selecting the electricity source and the funding model specification is performed by collecting the selection criteria first, followed by the alternatives to be selected, and then continued to performing the feasibility study of the selected alternatives to examine and to evaluate their technical and financial performance.     \n \n \n \n\nThe new competitive supply capability to be built according to this study consists of: one unit of80 MW Coal Fired Boiler funded by Commercial Bank Loan, one unit of 120 MW Coal Steam Power Plant funded by a Joint Venture between KDL and investor, and one Unit of80 MW Coal Fired Boiler funded by Commercial Bank Loan.", "Daftar File": {"2012 TS PP AUGUSDINI SIMANJUNTAK 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/87845", "2012 TS PP AUGUSDINI SIMANJUNTAK 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/87846", "2012 TS PP AUGUSDINI SIMANJUNTAK 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/87847", "2012 TS PP AUGUSDINI SIMANJUNTAK 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/87848", "2012 TS PP AUGUSDINI SIMANJUNTAK 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/87849", "2012 TS PP AUGUSDINI SIMANJUNTAK 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/87850"}, "Penulis": "AUGUSDINI SIMANJUNTAK (NIM: 29110454)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Ir.
