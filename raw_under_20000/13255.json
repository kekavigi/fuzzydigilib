{"Nomor": 13255, "Judul": "APPLICATION OF THE LINEAR THEORY METHOD FOR PREDICTING PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION ON COMPLEX GAS PIPELINE NETWORK USING PANHANDLE-A AND PANHANDLE-B CORRELATION", "Abstrak": "The purpose of this paper is to calculate the pressure distribution on the complex gas pipeline network. In this paper we apply The Linear Theory Method to make Panhandle A equation linear. The continuity equation can be obtained from the Kirchhofft's first law to the every node in a network. By using hypothetical data, has been successfully simulated and the results of calculating were compared to the commercial software. From the results for the low rate case show that Panhandle B gives the lowest pressure distribution then followed by Panhandle A and Weymouth respectively. Whereas, for the high rate case Panhandle B gives the highest pressure distribution then followed by Panhandle A and Weymouth respectively.", "Daftar File": {"2010 TA PP ANDRIANTO 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/57371"}, "Penulis": "ANDRIANTO (NIM 12206078)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Ir.
