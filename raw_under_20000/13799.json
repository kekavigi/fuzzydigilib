{"Nomor": 13799, "Judul": "THE STUDY OF INITIAL AND OPTIMIZED CRS ATTRIBUTES INFLUENCES TO VELOCITY MODEL AND DEPTH MIGRATION: AN APPLICATION IN SEISMIC DATA WITH MULTIPLE CASE", "Abstrak": "During applying CRS-stack method, one normally should implement initial and optimization CRS steps, in which each step produces stack section and its attributes, as well. In this thesis, it has been observed that the stack section produced from the optimization CRS step has no significant difference if it is compared to the section resulted from the initial CRS step. However, the values of their attributes are difference. As implication, the velocity model that will be produced by applying the NIP-wave tomography will have significant difference between one and another. It will be a serious problem, if the CRS-Stack method is applied to seismic data with the presence of multiple events, since both reflection events and multiples will be enhanced. Moreover, optimized CRS attributes increase the value of attributes that located around multiple higher than initial CRS attributes.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "R. MOCHAMAD TOFAN S.
