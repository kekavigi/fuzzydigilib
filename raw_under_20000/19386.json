Research area has a type of river flow patterns rektangular. This pattern is controlled by  geological structures that develop in the area of research. Based on the results of the   analysis of topographic maps and observations that have been made in the field, the   geomorphology research area is divided into four geomorfological units classification   based on Lobeck (1939). Which are Folds Hills Unit, Folds Plain Unit, Homoklin Hills       \n \n \n\nUnit, and Alluvial Plain Unit.       \n \n \n\nStratigraphy of research area consists of deposit series start from Late Miocene to Middle Pliocen. Stratigraphy of research area can be divided into five litostratigraphyunits by field observation, lithology characteristic, and age. Which are from old to young: Claystone Unit, Sandstone-Claystone Unit, Breccia Units, Breccia-Sandstone Unit, and Alluvial Unit. All itostratigraphy units in the research area deposit in deep water environment.Geological structure formation took place during Plio-Pleistocene deformation  periods. Geological Structures in research area area are thrust faults, strike-slip faults,and folds trending northwest-southeast and northeast-southwest. and strike-slip faults.Right-slip faults in the research area formed by tear fault mechanism. This presented by difference of folding geometry that indicating difference of accomodation force at the two blocks which separated by those faults.", "Daftar File": {"2014 TA PP RUDI SAPUTRA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/97232", "2014 TA PP RUDI SAPUTRA 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/97233", "2014 TA PP RUDI SAPUTRA 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/97234", "2014 TA PP RUDI SAPUTRA 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/97235", "2014 TA PP RUDI SAPUTRA 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/97236", "2014 TA PP RUDI SAPUTRA 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/97237", "2014 TA PP RUDI SAPUTRA 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/97238"}, "Penulis": "RUDY SAPUTRA (NIM :12010089)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing :Dr. Ir Asep Heri Patria Kesumajana ,MT."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Cibingbin, Halang Formation, deep water, tear fault", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
