{"Nomor": 10149, "Judul": "AN OPTIMIZATION PLANNING OF EVACUATION FACILITIES FOR TSUNAMI DISASTER MANAGEMENT IN NORTH ACEH DISTRICT (STUDY CASE: SAMUDERA SUB-DISTRICT)", "Abstrak": "The tsunami disaster caused severe and wide reaching devastation along the west and east coastal area of Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam Province. Afterward, Indonesian Government published a map of tsunami disaster prone area where North Aceh District has a high and medium level of tsunami disaster risk. Unfortunately, this area is lack of disaster management. Thus, it was becoming a challenge to provide mitigation facilities.The purpose of this study is to determine the optimum evacuation buildings at the minimum distance from the residential areas as well as evacuation shelters and minimum aid distribution time in order to mitigate tsunami disasters in the future and create a resilient community.This study also sight to answer the following questions: first, where is the best location to build the evacuation facilities referring to minimum distance from villagers' houses to the candidate of evacuation building/site? Second, where are the optimized evacuation shelters that will be becoming temporary residences for the refugees after disaster? Last, which is the optimized route for distributing aid to refugee in shelters referring to the shortest travel distribution time?After identified the problems of this study, it is continued by identified the study area which divided into five zones. Thereafter, it identified the villagers' houses and the possible building to be proposed for evacuation building. Data used in this study are distance from villagers' houses to evacuation buildings/sites and to evacuation shelters, population data, land use and infrastructure data. Those data are analysed referring to linear programming through VBA as the calculation tool by quantitative and qualitative method. Evacuation building for Krueng Matee and Beuringen (Zone 1) will be built in three sites which total distance is 54,311.58 meter. Meanwhile, the second site and Masjid Attaqwa in Gampong Sawang as Zone 2 is the most optimized place to build evacuation building referring to the summation of distance, 35,287.98 meter. In Zone 3, constructed evacuation shelter is tents in Gampong Pie. Whilst Zone 4, RISHA will be developed in Gampong Pulo. Moreover the shortest route to distributing the aid to both shelters is Alternative 4. The routes are from logistic center in Blang Peuria to Shelter 1 in Gampong Pie and then continue to Shelter 2 in Gampong Pulo through national road network. The return route is via national road network from Shelter 2 in Gampong Pulo to logistics center in Blang Peuria. The calculated time is 47.3208 minute for each trip.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "CUT FRIDA MEUTIA KARI (NIM 25406056)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Prof. Keiichi Ogawa dan Drs.
