{"Nomor": 13280, "Judul": "A NEW CORRELATION TO EVALUATE HORIZONTAL WELLS WITH MULTIPLE TRANSVERSE HYDRAULIC FRACTURES IN LOW PERMEABILITY OIL RESERVOIRS", "Abstrak": "A common correlation to evaluate success of hydraulic fracturing operation is the productivity index ratio (J/Jo). However, this term only involves a very short time evaluation basis. Thus, we propose a more realistic and economically reliable namely, cumulative production ratio. A correlation is generated from a conceptual reservoir simulation model applying to sensitivity analysis on various parameters to investigate the effect of each parameter. The resulted correlation can be used to determine an optimum fracture half length and fracture number of horizontal well for a certain horizontal length considering reservoir characteristics and also to evaluate hydraulic fracturing effectiveness. By this new correlation, the application of hydraulic fracturing design in horizontal well is expected to be more robust as well as accurate.", "Daftar File": {"2010 TA PP ARDIAN PRADHANA PUTRA 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/57538"}, "Penulis": "ARDIAN PRADHANA PUTRA (NIM 12206084)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. Ir.
