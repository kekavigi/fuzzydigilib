New data \n\nis going up and the old data becomes rarely used. For instance, on Academic Infromation System of \n\nEngineering Faculty Mataram University, only active student data has high intensity use, whereas passed \n\nstudent data is inactive. These old data can not be deleted because it is important for validating passed \n\nstudent\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s transcript in the future. This study gives an alternative way on the use of old academic data for predicting \n\nstudent successfulness study by using Bayesian Network. It is very valuable for student to determie their \n\nlearning strategy, taking the next study subjects, and deciding expertise field. Student supervising process is \n\none of the main tasks of lecturer as an academic supervisor that has important factor of student\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s success in their \n\nstudy in a university. It is a responsibility of a lecturer to drive students for finishing their study in the best \n\nway that consider to previous academic achievement. It can be implemented by Bayesian Network and it \n\nmay help a student to achieve the best result in the appropriate studying field. On the other hand, this \n\nstudy gives a convenient tool to the lectures for supervising students in their study planning. The idea of this \n\nresearch came from several papers about Intelligent Tutorial System, ITS. ITS has ability to know several \n\npedagogic aspects of a student by their Student Model; therefore, it can give a suitable study method for \n\nstudents. A method that commonly used by ITS for constructing student model is Bayesian Network because \n\nit can be performed in unceratin domain. The ITS principle can be adopted for predicting the successfulness \n\nstudy by implementing Student Model of ITS and then students take next study subjects based on this \n\nprediction that are put in their study planning card (Kartu Rencana Studi, KRS). This predictor devides \n\nsuccessfulness study into three categories, there are high GPA students, medium GPA students, and low GPA \n\nstudents. Overall, accuracy of this predictor is 74,7% and especially accuracy 0f high category is 93,75%, \n\nmedium is 60%, and low is 83,3%. However, as commonly understood that the result of this predictor is if it \n\nis the same or higher then the prediction result; therefore, by this point of view, the accuracy of this \n\npredictor is 93,3%.", "Daftar File": {"proceedings knsi 2014 full edition(28).pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/74391"}, "Penulis": "Heri Wijayanto, Sari Ismi Wardani, Misbahuddin", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["#CONTRIBUTOR#"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "bayesion network prediction, successfulness study, academic information system.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Mar 2014"}
