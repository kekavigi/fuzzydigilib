{"Nomor": 14185, "Judul": "NUMERICAL MODELLING OF HYDRODYNAMICS AND EVIDENCE OF CAY EROSION IN SERIBU ISLANDS", "Abstrak": "Seribu (Thousand) Islands is a patch reef complexes off Jakarta Bay that have experienced severe erosions. A recent study advises that monsoonal wind-induced wave surf actions are thought to contribute to this by causing seasonal change of beach line positions. This research is intended to understand the pattern of the sand movement transport around a coral island\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s beach line. A two-dimensional numerical simulation is applied in order to understand the near shore current under different wind scenario, i.e. NW and SE monsoons. It is found that the net neap-spring current vectors resulted from the simulation show directional trend, which fits well the hypothetical directional pattern of seasonal sand movement. The result of this study has helped to complement recent findings on changes of beach line and development of sand spit on the focal point of which are based on the interpretation of remote sensing imagery in different epochs.", "Daftar File": {"2012 TA PP GABRIELLA ALODIA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/63844", "2012 TA PP GABRIELLA ALODIA 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/63845", "2012 TA PP GABRIELLA ALODIA 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/63846", "2012 TA PP GABRIELLA ALODIA 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/63847", "2012 TA PP GABRIELLA ALODIA 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/63848", "2012 TA PP GABRIELLA ALODIA 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/63849"}, "Penulis": "GABRIELLA ALODIA (NIM 15108018)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr.rer.nat Poerbandono dan Dr. Eng.
