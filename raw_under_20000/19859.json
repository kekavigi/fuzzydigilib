{"Nomor": 19859, "Judul": "TSUNAMIGENIC POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT IN THE SUMATRA LOCKED ZONE BY FRICTIONAL PROPERTIES STUDIES", "Abstrak": "The Sumatra subduction zone is known as one of the most seismically active zone in the world. During the last decade, there has been at least five Mw > 7.5 earthquakes along this area but the 500km long patches in the north Mentawai islands is still locked. This locked zone could produce a Mw 9 earthquake and if the rupture of the earthquake propagates to the surface which was the case of the disastrous Sumatra-Andaman earthquake 2004, thus, it will lead to another devastating tsunami. We have access to a very high-quality industry deep seismic reflection profile from the subducting interface down to 20km depth. It shows a presence of bi-vergence anticlinal pop-up structures along the upper layer of the accretionary wedge with its size are vary from 1-3km wide. These data also show a pseudo-decollement (intermediate layer) where these pop-up structures seem to be developed. We perform mechanical modeling to determine the mechanical process and frictional properties of this locked zone. It turns out that we should have a ramp and a flat layer with lower effective friction to generate a pop-up structure. I find the required frictional properties to have seaward-landward-pop up structure and fore-back-thrust as well as to activate the intermediate layer. I model the 3 pop-ups structure at the frontal part to determine its frictional properties and assess the tsunamigenic potential. It is found that the frictional properties at the frontal part are classified as low frictions which indicate seismogenic potential along the updip part of the subducting interface. We model 4 possibilites of rupture and calculate the sediment uplift at the surface. The horizontal displacement could be 8.6m and 0.96m in vertical direction if the rupture propagates using the plate interface. In addition, if the rupture propagates using the pop-up structures, the sediment uplift will be distributed by each pop-up and give a 6.6m of horizontal displacement and 1.3m of vertical displacement which leads to water uplift and produce large tsunami.", "Daftar File": {"2014 TS PP ALVINA KUSUMADEWI KUNCORO 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/100760", "2014 TS PP ALVINA KUSUMADEWI KUNCORO 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/100759", "2014 TS PP ALVINA KUSUMADEWI KUNCORO 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/100758", "2014 TS PP ALVINA KUSUMADEWI KUNCORO 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/100757", "2014 TS PP ALVINA KUSUMADEWI KUNCORO 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/100756", "2014 TS PP ALVINA KUSUMADEWI KUNCORO 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/100755", "2014 TS PP ALVINA KUSUMADEWI KUNCORO 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/100754"}, "Penulis": "ALVINA KUSUMADEWI KUNCORO (NIM : 20212057)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Khairul Basar"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Friksi, zona terkunci, pemodelan mekanik, Mentawai, Sumatra, resiko tsunami", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
