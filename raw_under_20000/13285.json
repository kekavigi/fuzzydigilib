{"Nomor": 13285, "Judul": "THE APPLICATION OF ACOUSTIC IMPEDANCE INVERSION METHOD TO IDENTIFY GUMAI D RESERVOIR DISTRIBUTION IN MUARABULIAN AREA, INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "Today, seismic methods play a major role in petroleum exploration and reservoir monitoring. Correct interpretation of seismic data is important to minimize the risk and uncertainty. One of the methods which can improve interpretation and has been widely used is seismic inversion. Gumai D sandstone is a potential reservoir in Muarabulian area. However, the deliniation of this reservoir has never been done. Several wells have been drilled in this area and have proven to produce hydrocarbon within Gumai D sandstone. In order to obtain the distribution of Gumai D sandstone in this area, we have to integrate reservoir properties such as porosity and volume fraction of clay into acoustic impedance section.Today, seismic methods play a major role in petroleum exploration and reservoir monitoring.
