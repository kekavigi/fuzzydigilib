{"Nomor": 11446, "Judul": "DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING OF DURABILITY TESTING DEVICE FOR AUTOMOBILE ENGINE CLUTCHES", "Abstrak": "Unremitting economic growth will constantly be in line with the increase of mobility of the community. The sales in automotive business have reached an incredible value. The manufacture of automotive component proves to be a growing business right in line with the public's rising demands on road vehicles. Clutch is an essential part of road vehicles. Hence, it needs to perform under particular condition and test needs to be performed to guarantee that the system will function as desired. Durability testing device for automobile engine clutches is one of numerous tests which need to be performed onto the clutch system. The principle of this test is to engage and disengage the clutch according to the requirement which is specified by the Daikin's manual book. The developed torque needs to be acquired to analyze the specimen. Coefficient of friction, wear rate, and scoring at pressure plate and flywheel friction area are the expected results that will be used as feedbacks. After several design alternatives, the model of the design instead of the testing device is proposed due to endowment limitation. The main parts of the model are motor as a driver, flywheel as an energy storage components, clutch specimen, and actuating mechanism.The system consists of several components or subsystems that should be designed and manufactured appropriately. Those subsystems are flywheel, actuating mechanism, shaft system, and driver. The primary consideration of the design is the space availability in the laboratory. Its manufacturing is using familiar materials and conventional machine with the aim of reducing cost. Manufacturing process of other systems is done based on common design and experiences at testing. Preliminary testing has to be performed on system and each subsystem in order to learn the operating characteristics and to know system weaknesses which has to be repaired. Preliminary testing is performed on the whole system to recognize the characteristic of the system and to ensure that the system works properly. Measurement system and autonomous mechanism which have not been designed yet require to be implemented in order to work as desired.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "STEPHANUS MICHAELl DWIPRASETYO WIDJANARKO (NIM 13104025)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Pulung Nurprasetio, MSME."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "durability, koupling, engine clutches, testing device", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Vika Anastasya Kovariansi \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
