{"Nomor": 13753, "Judul": "TECHNOLOGY COMMERCIALIZATION ASSESSMENT Preparing the Use and Development of Technology from Laboratory and Bring It to Market (Case Study: Ultra Bright LED)", "Abstrak": "This final project is focused on the deep analysis of innovative technology research development through university technology commercialization. The method will use the case study of technology research development in university using the university technology commercialization concept. Besides, this paper also tries to implement technology commercialization concept specifically the new product development on one of the innovative technology, LED lamp. Technology commercialization assessment is done by comparing the technology commercialization step with the current condition process in the university by reviewing from the bottom of the research process until further process of commercialization in the incubator or community development. The data for the assessment are gathered from observation, interview and from the literature. In doing the new product development process, writer try to use the managing innovation theories that expected to have result in new breakthrough product that can fulfill the people's need.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "RADEYA PRANATA (NIM 19006068)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dwi Larso Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Technology Commercialization, Technology Research Development, University", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Vika Anastasya Kovariansi \u00a0\n                                     Vika Anastasya Kovariansi", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Mar 2012"}
