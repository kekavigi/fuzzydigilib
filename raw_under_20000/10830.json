{"Nomor": 10830, "Judul": "BEHAVIOR OF THIN-WALLED PRISMATIC STRUCTURES SUBJECTED TO LOW VELOCITY IMPACT LOADING", "Abstrak": "Thin-wall prismatic columns are used to absorb impact energy in various engineering systems e.g. the frontal chassis structure of an automobile. This research presents the prediction and comparison of the behavior of thin-walled prismatic columns having various cross-sections (square, hexagon, octagon and circular); spot-weld top-hat and double-hat sections in absorbing energy using theoretical, numerical and experimental analysis. These tubes collapse with progressive buckling mode are subjected to low axial velocity impact loading. Progressive dynamic mean crushing force and folding crushing length of hexagonal and octagonal tube were developed based on superfolding element conception, a relation between theory of multi-corner columnd and circular tube was also figured out. An explicit non-linear commercial finite element code LS-DYNA was used to predict the response of thin-walled structures subjected to dynamic axial crushing. \n \n \n \n \n \n\nResults of analytical and numerical methods have good agreement for both prismatic columns and tubular-hat sections subjected to low velocity impact loading. By increasing the number of corners, the crushing behavior of multicorner prismatic columns will approach the behavior of circular tube in case of progressive crushing concertina deformation mode. Circular tube has the highest mean crushing force and shortest folding length, whereas square tube has lowest mean crushing force and longest folding length. Numerical study also stated that energy absorption capability of square tube can be improved by introducing trigger as a circumferential slot located in all wall of tube at at the theoretical full folding length 2H measured from top of the tube. Results of experimental work give a qualitative study about the collapse mode of each kinds of prismatic columns. \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe validated numerical model was used to study the energy absorbing behavior of thin-walled top-hat and double-hat sections with variations in spotweld spacing. From analytical and numerical results, it was observed that a higher degree of effectiveness was found for tubular-hat sections than box structure having similar cross-section area. By increasing the number of right angle elements, energy absorption of structure increases significantly (approximately 90% energy absorption increasing of double-hat section compare to square section).", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "LY HUNG ANH (NIM 23605005)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Ichsan Setya Putra, Dr. Tatacipta Dirgantara, dan Dr. Djarot Widagdo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Crashworthiness, Thin-walled structure, Impact, Crushing", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Rizki Aprianti \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "8 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Okt 2017"}
