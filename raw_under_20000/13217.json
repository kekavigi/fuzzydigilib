{"Nomor": 13217, "Judul": "ARTIFICIAL LIFT SELECTION AND DESIGN ON SEMBERAH'S OIL FIELD", "Abstrak": "This paper elaborates the most appropriate artificial lift methods for four onshore wells from two oil reservoirs. First, the initial screening using the ARLIST (Artificial Lift Selection Algorithm) was performed to eliminate some Sartificial lift methods in simple way by considering the common criteria that is suitable with the tools capability. Then, MBAL and PROSPER reservoir system analysis program was used to forecast the reservoir performance and the oil recovery either naturally or using the artificial lift method. The remaining methods, which were recommended by ARLIST, were then compared in terms of ultimate oil recovery, so then the economical analysis in further research can be carried out to evaluate the probability of achieving the optimum results.", "Daftar File": {"2010 TA PP AHMAD REIZKY AZHAR 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/57122"}, "Penulis": "AHMAD REIZKY AZHAR (NIM 12206071)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. Ir.
