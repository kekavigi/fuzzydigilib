{"Nomor": 12829, "Judul": "ELECTRON AND HOLE TUNNELING CURRENTS THROUGH Si/Si0.5Ge0.5/Si npn HETEROSTRUCTURE BIPOLAR TRANSISTORS", "Abstrak": "In this final project, electron and hole tunneling currents trough Si/Si0.5Ge0.5/Si npn HBT structure were calculated. The potential profiles were developed by using a Gauss-Poisson equation. This potential profile then approximated to make the calculating of electron and hole transmittance easier. This result then used to the next calculation of electron and hole tunnel currents. It was demonstrated that the tunneling current of electron is much bigger than hole tunneling currents. The barrier height for each tunneling contributes a great impact for tunneling current while the velocities of electron only gives a little contribution to the current. Knowing of electron and hole tunneling currents is very important to know the properties of Si/Si0.5Ge0.5/Si npn HBT device such as the gaining current and so on.", "Daftar File": {"2009 TA PP ADY ISWANTO 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/54952", "2009 TA PP ADY ISWANTO 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/54953", "2009 TA PP ADY ISWANTO 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/54954", "2009 TA PP ADY ISWANTO 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/54955", "2009 TA PP ADY ISWANTO 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/54956", "2009 TA PP ADY ISWANTO 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/54957", "2009 TA PP ADY ISWANTO 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/54958"}, "Penulis": "ADY ISWANTO (NIM 10205033)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. Eng.
