UNTUK STUDI AWAL POTENSI APLIKASI PADA SEL SURYA", "Abstrak": "Since the reserve of fossil energy resources is decreasing, the searching of renewable alternative-energy resources is being continuously undertaken. Solar energy is very potential to be utilized owing to its availability all year long. Photosynthetic pigment-sensitized solar cells have been developed, but the use of the pigment derived from fruits and vegetables will compete with the fulfillment of human food. Navicula sp., one of marine microalgae, is potential to be an alternative light-harvesting pigments source. The purposes of this research are to isolate and characterize the photosynthetic pigments from Navicula sp., also to determine the ability of crude extract pigment in harvesting light, so that it could be applied in solar cell. This research was conducted through cultivating Navicula sp. in modified medium; isolating pigments by extracting dried-biomass in acetone; separating pigments was using thin-layer chromatograph (TLC) plate which was eluted in acetone:hexane = 3:7 (v/v); characterizing pigments by spectra absorption scanning in ultraviolet and visible light, and light-harvesting test used red lamp. The results of this research showed that the best cultivation of Navicula sp. in modified medium produced 1.48 gram/Liter (g/L) of biomass density. There were 6 pigments from TLC plate which have characteristic of absorption spectra at 350\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u20131.000 nm and identified having similarities with chlorophyll c, fucoxanthin, 19\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019-butanoyloxyfucoxanthin-like, pheophytin a, chlorophyll a and 13-cis-\u03b2-carotene spectra. Light-harvesting test was conducted using red lamp with 6.800 lux of intensity. The result showed that the potential value of pigment solution (1 g dried biomass/12 mL acetone) in olive oil (1:2 v/v) increased from 0 mV (t=0 minute) to 22 mV (t=110 minutes), and the potential value slowly decreased until 1\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u20132 mV (t=300 minutes). Based on this research, the crude extract of photosynthetic pigment derived from Navicula sp. had the ability to harvest red light.", "Daftar File": {"2012 TA PP HAIRUNNISA 1- COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/73877", "2012 TA PP HAIRUNNISA 1- BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/73878", "2012 TA PP HAIRUNNISA 1- BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/73879", "2012 TA PP HAIRUNNISA 1- BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/73880", "2012 TA PP HAIRUNNISA 1- BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/73881", "2012 TA PP HAIRUNNISA 1- BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/73882", "2012 TA PP HAIRUNNISA 1- PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/73883"}, "Penulis": "HAIRUNNISA  (NIM : 10508037)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing  I :  Dr. Santi Nurbaiti", "Pembimbing  II : Zeily Nurachman, D.Sc"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Navicula sp., mikroalga, isolasi pigmen, sel surya", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
