The fact that hydrofoil was \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u201cunintentionally\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u201d found and has been used to \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u201csimply\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u201d lift up a ship\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s hull out of the water to reduce drag, has made this concept sounds lame and impractical. Today\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s hydrofoil population is exceptionally rare. Few survivors serve as fast civil water-transportation mode in Pacific rig, China, Greek, as well as Russia and a small number of European countries. Fortunately, hydrofoils found their admirers among human\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2013powered vehicle community. Continuing intention to design and built a high speed human-powered water craft seems to give hydrofoil a promising future. This report delivers the conceptual and preliminary design of new human-powered hydrofoil called \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u201cEz-Skimmer\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u201d prepared to be used as recreational vessels. With limited power available around 0.35 HP, this 6-meter\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2013single seat\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2013hydrofoil is capable of reaching 6 knots [3 m/s] during its cruise. The design process starts from stating mission description, some configuration studies and selections, to analytical calculations of the craft\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s performance, and finally to validation through sub-scale model manufacturing and testing. The concept offered here is quite simple, proven, and ready to bring on to the next design phase. Yet, there are still some rooms for improvements and corrections to be made during the following phase.", "Daftar File": {"2009 TA PP APRIZAL NAHLA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/68745", "2009 TA PP APRIZAL NAHLA 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/68746", "2009 TA PP APRIZAL NAHLA 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/68747", "2009 TA PP APRIZAL NAHLA 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/68748", "2009 TA PP APRIZAL NAHLA 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/68749", "2009 TA PP APRIZAL NAHLA 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/68750", "2009 TA PP APRIZAL NAHLA 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/68751"}, "Penulis": "APRIZAL NAHLA  (NIM  : 13603032)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing :  Dr. Taufiq Mulyanto"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "concept validation, human-powered craft, hydrofoil, preliminary design, watercraft design", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Okt 2017"}
