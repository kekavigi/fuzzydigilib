{"Nomor": 15318, "Judul": "ESTIMATION OF STRESS INTENSITY FACTOR BY USING DIGITAL IMAGE CORRELATION TECHNIQUE", "Abstrak": "Nowadays, optical technique becomes popular among the researchers. One kind of optical method is digital image correlation. Digital image correlation is an optical method that employs 2D or 3D measurements of deformations, displacement, and strain.    \n \n \n \n\nThe application of DIC also becomes popular among the researchers, especially in fracture mechanics. And estimation of stress intensity factor (SIF) is one of the popular topics to discuss. Stress intensity factor K is used in fracture mechanics to more accurately predict the stress state near crack tip caused by a remote load or    \n \n \n \n\nresidual stresses. This research was conducting a development of program for estimation of stress intensity factor. The program was developed based on nonlinear    \n \n \n \n\nleast square technique for case under mode I loading. This research was also conducting development SIF program based on crack surface displacement extrapolation method.    \n \n \n \n\nOn the other hand, there are any requirements of simplicity in DIC process. Therefore this research was also conducted a development of graphical user interface (GUI) for DIC technique which based on MATLAB code.", "Daftar File": {"2008 TA PP DEDY ASDIAWAN WIBOWO 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/70880", "2008 TA PP DEDY ASDIAWAN WIBOWO 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/70881", "2008 TA PP DEDY ASDIAWAN WIBOWO 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/70882", "2008 TA PP DEDY ASDIAWAN WIBOWO 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/70883", "2008 TA PP DEDY ASDIAWAN WIBOWO 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/70884", "2008 TA PP DEDY ASDIAWAN WIBOWO 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/70885", "2008 TA PP DEDY ASDIAWAN WIBOWO 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/70886"}, "Penulis": "DEDY ASDIAWAN WIBOWO (NIM :13604040)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Tim Pembimbing :     \n \n \n \n\nDr. Ir.
