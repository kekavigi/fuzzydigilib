{"Nomor": 11676, "Judul": "IMAGE RECOGNITION OF OBJECT BASED ON GEOMETRY SHAPES APRROACH", "Abstrak": "Recognize an object is one of the most popular research areas on image processing and computer vision. Recognize an object can be implemented in wide area such as industry, and research. In industry, recognize an object has been used for quality control to classify a good product and the flaw one. In research area, it is used for detecting an object or maybe data mining. In this research, we are trying to recognize an object from file image. The recognition is based on each area, and it will recognize into basic shapes. The result is the program can recognize basic shapes, and also its combination. It is shown by experiment that it has a high similarity for a basic shape up to 99%. But it has some lacks in recognizing real objects and need more improvement especially in segmentation process.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "YULIUS SATRIADI GUNAWAN (NIM 10204059)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. Suprijadi, M.Eng."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "image recognition, geometry shapes", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Vika Anastasya Kovariansi \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
