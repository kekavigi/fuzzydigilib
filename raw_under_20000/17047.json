{"Nomor": 17047, "Judul": "AIRCRAFT ENGINE WATER WASH EVALUATION CASE STUDY OF  PT GMF AEROASIA", "Abstrak": "Engine is one of the most important system and part on the aircraft. It generates thrust to move the aircraft. During operation of the engine, contaminants in the environment accumulate on airfoil surfaces and it cause drag.    \n \n \n \n\nTo counteract the degradation of the airfoils, the turbine which driving the compressor rotors must rotate at higher speeds to get same amount of thrust to maintain speed and altitude of the aircraft. As the result the engine burns more fuel and runs at a higher temperature. Overall, the airline company has to spend more money to cover additional fuel consumption and additional maintenance.    \n \n \n \n\nThey are several improvement programs can be conducted by the company to improve the performance of the aircraft engine including reduction of fuel consumption and increasing of time on wing (EGT Margin). One of them is using Aircraft Engine Compressor Wash Program. From the case and situation in the company of internship takes place, the author evaluated and compared the effects of aircraft engine compressor wash accomplishment from two different tools (current and new tools).    \n \n \n \n\nFrom the result that was generated on Chapter 3, 5, and Appendix, the new tool of compressor wash tool gives better improvement in reducing of fuel consumption and increasing of time on wing (EGT Margin) than the current tool. The new tool gives efficiency procedure of operation, stability control of machine, and accuracy of cleaning process too. And the most important benefit that was reached in this research is the new tool gives more long time effect of performance improvement, so the compressor wash accomplishment shouldn\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019t often to be done. Overall, the company will generate additional profit by reduction of operation and maintenance cost.", "Daftar File": {"2010 TA PP RIZA AFANDI 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/81300", "2010 TA PP RIZA AFANDI 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/81301", "2010 TA PP RIZA AFANDI 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/81302", "2010 TA PP RIZA AFANDI 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/81303", "2010 TA PP RIZA AFANDI 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/81304", "2010 TA PP RIZA AFANDI 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/81305", "2010 TA PP RIZA AFANDI 1-BAB 6.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/81306", "2010 TA PP RIZA AFANDI 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/81307"}, "Penulis": "RIZA AFANDI (NIM :  13605036 )", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Tim pembimbing : Dr. Firman Hartono (ITB)", "Dr. Arief Hariyanto (ITB)", "Iqbal Faraz Dasril, ST (PT GMF Aero-Asia)"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Engine, EGT Margin, aircraft, aircraft engine water, PT GMF AEROASIA, Aircraft Engine Compressor Wash Program", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "8 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Okt 2017"}
