{"Nomor": 12366, "Judul": "OPTICAL AND LOCALIZATION PROPERTIES OF CYLINDRICAL AGGREGATES", "Abstrak": "Dye aggregates are interesting physical systems due to their strong interaction with light and their resemblance to natural light-harvesting systems. The interactions between molecules in the aggregate lead to shared electronic excited states, known as excitons. We use a Frenkel exciton model to analyze the optical properties of two such systems, bacteriochlorophyll and C8S3 aggregates, which both have a cylindrical geometry. For the simple homogeneous case, it can be shown that the cylindrical geometry dictates strong selection rules for the optically allowed transitions to the collective electronic excited states. In a more realistic model that includes disorder, the exciton states become more localized and may only extend over part of the cylinder. We show that this behavior indeed occurs by analyzing the spatial extent of the autocorrelation function, and secondly, we show that the localized nature of the relevant exciton states indeed imply violations of the optical selection rules for realistic disorder magnitudes.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MAUREEN LINGGARSARI NIETIADI (NIM 20207018)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Alexander A.
