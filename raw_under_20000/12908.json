{"Nomor": 12908, "Judul": "PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT MODEL BASED ON KEY FINANCIAL RATIOS OF DEBTORS IN BANKING SECTOR", "Abstrak": "The purpose of this research is to establish a model and investigate factors influencing the bank debtors' probability of default in Indonesia. The results of the research will be used to build model capable of predicting debtors' probability of default. High non-performing loans (NPL) were one the factors causing 1998 financial crisis in Indonesia, and also become one of the problems in Bank X. As such, the study attempt to find factors influencing the debtor's performing loans in Indonesia. Sub variables of size, operational performance, turnover, debt service capability, interest coverage capability, capital structure, sales growth, leverage, liquidity and investment intensiveness are hypothesized to influence non performing loans in Indonesia. These sub variables are Size, Return on Equity, Investment Turnover, Debt Service Coverage Ratio, Interest Coverage Ratio, Debt to Equity Ratio, Sales Growth, Leverage Ratio, Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, Working Capital to Sales, and Return on Investment. This research used the survey methodology with respondents comprising of debtors of Bank X. The survey collected about 30 samples which are taken by using simple random sampling technique. Secondary data is collected from Bank X in the form of debtors' financial data in 2008. This research applied econometric model using multiple regression analysis technique. Based on the result and analysis of the research, it is concluded that sub variables above can in general explain debtors' probability of default in Bank X. The addition of sub variables which are return on equity (operational performance), interest coverage ratio (interest coverage capability), Current Ratio and Working Capital to Sales (liquidity), and return on investment (investment intensiveness) in predicting this model has developed this model more precisely as much as 91.89 % (higher than value of R square in previous research).", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "DIAN C.
