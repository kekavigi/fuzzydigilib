{"Nomor": 12600, "Judul": "ANALISIS PENGARUH KARAKTERISTIK REGIONAL TERHADAP EFISIENSI TEKNIS: Studi kasus pada Industri Manufaktur kategori Industri Ringan Di Indonesia Tahun 1995-1997", "Abstrak": "This theses investigates the level of relative technical efficiency, productivity and the role of regional characteristics on technical efficiency performance of firms in Indonesian's light manufacturing industry. Data Envelopment Analysis, Malmquist Productivity Index and regression analysis are used on BPS's secondary data of about 3364 establishment during 1995-1997. Empirical results show that average technical efficiency had been low and the declines of technical efficiency were occurred. Considerable productivity growth was found in most of industrial sectors, but it was mainly accomplished through technical progress rather than efficiency improvement. Regression analyses indicate that the technical efficiency level were influenced by regional characteristics, where regional minimum wage, industrial specialization and variety had positive impacts, while the existence of foreign firms and urban size had negative impact on relative technical efficiency. Industrial competition level and firm's age had negative impact on technical efficiency. Empirical results also show that firms with foreign ownership dan medium scale firms were more likely to have higher level of relative technical efficiency.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "R.
