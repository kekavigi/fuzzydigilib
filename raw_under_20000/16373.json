Radiopharmaceutical, as a complex compound, consist of two components, i.e. radionuclide as the radiation source and ligand compound as the carrier. Many researches proved that radionuclide attached as a stable complex compound, can interact more effectively in the physiological condition of the body. Radionuclide of praseodymium-142 (142Pr) has a half-life of 19.12 hours with E beta max = 2.16 MeV and Ey max= 1575 keV (3.7%) and being suitable to be used as both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes in many cases of cancers. This radionuclide can be produced from neutron activation reaction in nuclear reactors. Among radiopharmaceuticals of 142Pr that have been used for therapeutic applications are        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n142Pr-DTPA and 142Pr-Hydroxy Apatite which are used in radiosynovectomy to alleviate pain and swelling in rheumatoid arthritis. In connection with the potency of 142Pr to be used as therapeutic and diagnostic radiopharmaceutical, the domestic applications are still limited. Accordingly, the preparations of alternative        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n142Pr(III)-radiopharmaceuticals using any other ligand compounds are necessary. Therefore, studies on complex formation between natural Pr(III) ion with various        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nligands such as O-donor ligands (i.e. succinic acid and trisodium citrate) and Ndonor ligands (i.e. dimethylamine, 1,4-diaminobutane, 1,6-diaminohexane, 1,4-phenylenediamine, 2,2'-bipyridine, 1,10-phenantroline, and 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nphenantroline, were performed. The interaction between Pr(III) ion with amino acid groups as the ligands, had also been observed through the same reaction with lysin, arginine, triptophan and methionine. The interactions of Pr(III) ion with those various ligands, were studied by reacting Pr(III) ion (as nitrate salt, Pr(NO3)3, in methanol) with the ligands and then refluxing the mixture at 60-70oC for 4 hours. The resulting compounds were purified by washing or by separating with column chromatography and then characterized using UV-Vis, FTIR and mass spectroscopy. It was observed that the results found in the reaction of Pr(III) with O-donor ligands showed wave number shift for C=O vibration absorption        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nfrom 1574 cm-1 to 1694 cm-1 and no absorption at 3405 cm-1 for O-H vibration. The interaction of Pr(III) ion with atom N in the aliphatic ligand was also observed based on FTIR spectra of Pr(III)-dimethylamine which shows a wave        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nnumber shift at 3646 cm-1 to 3413 cm-1 for N-H absorption. The FTIR spectra of Pr(III)-1,4-diaminobutane shows significant difference with FTIR spectra of 1,4-diaminobutane ligand indicating that Pr(III) ion has strong interaction with 1,4-diaminobutane. Meanwhile, FTIR spectra of Pr(III)-1,6-diaminohexane shows diminishing sorption intensity for N-H at 3389 cm-1; and UV-Vis spectra of this        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\ncompound shows only one peak at 202 nm. The reaction of Pr(III) ion with Ndonor ligand in aromatic compound (1,4-phenylenediamine) showed a strong interaction due to significant changing colour from green to purple. UV-Vis        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nspectra shows three peaks at lambda max (nm) of 203, 256, dan 557. The absorption at 557 nm is a characteristic of complex compound which shows that coordination bond has formed between 1,4-phenylenediamine and Pr(III) ion. Meanwhile, the wavenumber shift of aromatic groups from 1497 cm-1 to 1384 cm-1 shows that coordination bond between Pr(III) with N-donor ligand has formed. The result of        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nthe reaction of Pr(III) ions with another N-donor ligand (2,2'-bipyridine and 1,10-phenantroline) shows the same FTIR spectra but UV-Vis spectra of Pr-2,2'-bipyridine showed a higher maximum wavelength. The FTIR spectra of Pr(III)-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenantroline compared with FTIR spectra of the ligand, did not show any changes. The interactions between Pr(III) ions and amino acid group        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nligands showed the different results depend on the amino acid type. The interaction Pr(III) ion with lysine and argnine showed a strong interaction that can be seen from the formation of precipitation. Meanwhile, the reaction between Pr(III) ion and tryptophane and methionine did not show any change. So that it can be concluded that there is no interaction between Pr(III) ion and these two amino acids.", "Daftar File": {"2012 TS PP MARLINA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/77087", "2012 TS PP MARLINA 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/77086", "2012 TS PP MARLINA 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/77085", "2012 TS PP MARLINA 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/77084", "2012 TS PP MARLINA 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/77082", "2012 TS PP MARLINA 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/77083", "2012 TS PP MARLINA 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/77081"}, "Penulis": "MARLINA ( NIM :  20510032)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Tim Pembimbing : Prof. Dr. Euis Holisotan Hakim", "Dra.
