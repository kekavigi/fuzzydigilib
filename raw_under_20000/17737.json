{"Nomor": 17737, "Judul": "REALIZATION AND STUDY OF GRAPHENE TRANSISTOR THESIS", "Abstrak": "We report our study in bilayer graphene field effect transistor, where the graphene films grown by using mechanical exfoliation method on SiO2/Si substrate. To realize the field effect transistor configuration, we perform the masking process and contact deposition after we verified the sample by optical microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. In masking process, we used 4 \u03bcm diameter tungsten (W) wire as mask and attached over graphene surface mechanically using glue, scotch tape, and tweezer. Electrical contact for drain and source in our device is fabricated by gold evaporation method where the Cr/Au (100 nm/ 300nm) metal stacks are deposited as source and drain electrodes. We measured the I-V curve of bilayer graphene transistor with the gate width (w) and length (l) of 4 \u03bcm and 5 \u03bcm respectively, and its transfer characteristic by applying back gate voltage. We observed the resistivity of bilayer graphene is 2.67 \u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u2014 10-6 \u03a9m, which is in the range of resistivity of the graphite and acceptable result since it has interspace connection between each layers. The observation of n-type and p-type transitions verifies the ambipolar characteristic and low gate modulation. The hole and electron mobility were extracted to be \u03bch = 1408 cm2/Vs and \u03bce = 156 cm2/Vs respectively. We observed that the maximum and minimum drive current at Vd = 600 mV are 85 \u03bcA and 62 \u03bcA, yielding 1.37 on/off current ratio.", "Daftar File": {"2014 TS PP ABDURRAHMAN ALI 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/85271", "2014 TS PP ABDURRAHMAN ALI 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/85270", "2014 TS PP ABDURRAHMAN ALI 1-BAB 2A.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/85269", "2014 TS PP ABDURRAHMAN ALI 1-BAB 2B.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/85268", "2014 TS PP ABDURRAHMAN ALI 1-BAB 2C.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/85272", "2014 TS PP ABDURRAHMAN ALI 1-BAB 2D.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/85273", "2014 TS PP ABDURRAHMAN ALI 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/85274", "2014 TS PP ABDURRAHMAN ALI 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/85275", "2014 TS PP ABDURRAHMAN ALI 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/85276"}, "Penulis": "ABDURRAHMAN ALI (NIM: 20211032)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Khairul Basar"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Bilayer graphene, mechanical exfoliation, Raman spectroscopy, I-V curve", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "9 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
