PT Solare decided to choose third party firm; CV Citra Surya Utama (CV CSU) as the sales agent that will offer the products to the government organizations, and let the business segment handled by PT Solare personally. In the reality PT Solare just relying on government order which came from CV CSU and do not proactively approaches the business segment who only contributed 10 percent of total sales from 2004 until 2012.      \n \n \n \n \n \n\nMeanwhile the sales of SHS declined from 1217 units in 2009 to 246 in 2010 and just reach 150 units in 2012. The overall sales since 2009 also failed to reach sales target. The declines resulted from weak performance of CV CSU because of the owner divided concentration to his other ventures.
