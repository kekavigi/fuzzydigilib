{"Nomor": 16149, "Judul": "PARALLEL COMPUTING FOR NEWTON RAPHSON METHOD (CASE STUDY: STEWART PLATFORM)", "Abstrak": "Stewart Platform is a parallel manipulator with closed-kinematic linkage that give it great rigidity and high \n\nforce-to-weight ratio. Stewart Platform can be used as a platform for driving simulator. Stewart Platform must be \n\nable to move along specified path defined by the vehicle\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s position and orientation in time-based sequences. In \n\nthis thesis, a trajectory for Stewart Platform simulator (type 6-6, actuated by motor) is developed to simulate the \n\nmotion of simulator based on user input. The trajectory planner takes position and orientation as input, and then \n\nmaps it into platform\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s position and orientation as output. Things that must be considered in this trajectory \n\nplanning are calibration/adjustment of the Stewart Platform\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s geometry limitation constraints and the user \n\nexperience. Next, by inverse kinematic and using numerical method Newton-Raphson, the desired angles of \n\nservo motor is computed based on platform\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s position and orientation. Parallel computing can be used here to \n\nenhance the numerical process in solving inverse kinematic analysis of Stewart Platform 6-6 motor, its trajectory \n\nplanning to simulate the motion which is developed by using physic engine.", "Daftar File": {"proceedings knsi 2013(162).pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/75781"}, "Penulis": "Izzatul Ummah, Fitriyani", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["#CONTRIBUTOR#"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Stewart Platform, trajectory planning, Newton-Raphson, parallel computing", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Mar 2014"}
