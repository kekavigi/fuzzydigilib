In conducting the study, author conducted a study modelling using commercial model simulator, model validation, and sensitivity analysis. Model validation is done to validate used model to fit mature field condition. This procedure is required for the model used to perform sensitivity studies to show the model is a valid model and can represent the actual state of the field. The final step is to conduct sensitivity studies, namely to make changes in the parameters of fluids flow from the well for a variety of behavior obtained from the ppm of water removed from the wash tank. Then from the results of this sensitivity produced an equation.", "Daftar File": {"2010 TA PP ADLI 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/57021"}, "Penulis": "ADLI (NIM 12206061)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Ir.Tutuka Aridji,M.Sc.,Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Produced water, ppm oil, Pressure,Temperature,C7+ component,water cut", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Vika Anastasya Kovariansi \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
