{"Nomor": 15517, "Judul": "DESIGN AND COMPARISON OF CONICAL AND BELL NOZZLE FOR LIQUID ROCKET ENGINE RCX-150", "Abstrak": "As the pioneer of Indonesia\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s rocketry, National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) continue to develop their rocket technology. Recently, LAPAN has been seriously conducting research on liquid rocket engines. Several        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nliquid rocket engines have been produced to serve as experimental models, such as RCX-150, which desired to produce 150 kgf of thrust.        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe current RCX-150 leaves a room of improvement in its nozzle design as its conical nozzle is considered inefficient. Therefore, the present research is conducted to design the optimum nozzles for RCX-150. Using the existing technology in LAPAN, the new nozzles were determined to be bell nozzle, with conical nozzle as its comparison.        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe bell nozzle type is the Thrust Optimized Parabolic (TOP) nozzle. It is based on method from G.V.R.Rao to generate a Thrust Optimized Contoured        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nNozzle using parabolic equation. The method would result more efficient nozzle        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nthan cone or ideal bell nozzle.        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nA Computational Fluid Dynamics Method (CFD) is used to simulate the        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nnozzle design. The simulation was carried out in axis-symmetric condition using        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\ncommercial CFD software. Later, the result was validated through the utilization        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nof analytic calculation. However, the research also served to accommodate future        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nexperimental method by producing the selected nozzle design. The present        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nresearch also presented the experiment design and setup.", "Daftar File": {"2010 TA PP EKO PRIAMADI 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/71975", "2010 TA PP EKO PRIAMADI 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/71976", "2010 TA PP EKO PRIAMADI 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/71977", "2010 TA PP EKO PRIAMADI 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/71978", "2010 TA PP EKO PRIAMADI 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/71979", "2010 TA PP EKO PRIAMADI 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/71980", "2010 TA PP EKO PRIAMADI 1-BAB 6.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/71981", "2010 TA PP EKO PRIAMADI 1-BAB 7.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/71982", "2010 TA PP EKO PRIAMADI 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/71983"}, "Penulis": "EKO PRIAMADI (NIM : 13606015)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Romie O.Bura", "Dr. Arif Nur Hakim"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "LAPAN, RCX-150, The bell nozzle", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "9 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Okt 2017"}
