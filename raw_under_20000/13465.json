{"Nomor": 13465, "Judul": "BUSINESS PROCESS REENGINEERING OF X BOUTIQUE", "Abstrak": "This case began by examining the operational procedures of a company from within by conducting participant observatory. The chosen location of observation is X Boutique, an establishment that has been operating for 6 years with fast-paced business growth. However, despite their amazing growth in market share and sales, the company has many problems. These problems are based on dysfunctions within their operational workflow and human resource issues. Indeed X Boutique is a family business, but it is ideal that the solution to their problems is not a family-oriented solution. The solution should be based on professional values and standards. This case and the discussion of the solution is useful in understanding further about Business Process Reengineering and the essential concepts and the impact that it might bring to a business company. Within this case it is also possible to add additional dimensions of family business into the mix and incorporate it into the Business Process Reengineering theory. The most essential aspect to this paper is the introduction of Business Process Reengineering as a method for constructing the solution, and the organization of the company as the basis to correct the existing problems of the boutique.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "FAUZIA TRISNANTARI (NIM 19006050)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Ir.
