{"Nomor": 12497, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT OF AN EXPERIMENTAL PORTABLE ELECTROENCHEPALOGRAPH (Case Study: Alpha Wave Detector)", "Abstrak": "This thesis develops an EEG device for supporting BCI researches currently conducted by a research group at Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB). The ModularEEG hardware design (openeeg.sourceforge.net) is used as a basic design. It is redesigned and modified mainly for portable application usage. The firmware is developed to provide a portable and real-time alpha detector. It uses signal correlation and windowing for frequency-band detection. Additionally, it can also deliver the plain digitized brainwave signal directly to a PC. For robustness, the 50 Hz artifact is also detected, and along with the average of the signal, it is used to disable the detector output to reduce the false-positive result.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ORI NOVANDA (NIM 23206026)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Prof. Dr. Ir.
