{"Nomor": 17426, "Judul": "BEHAVIOUR OF BOLTED FLANGED JOINT UNDER STATIC OPERATING LOAD", "Abstrak": "Flanged joints with gaskets are widely used in pressurized system like pressure vessel and piping systems, and they are designed mainly to resist internal pressure. These joints are also used in special applications such as in nuclear reactors and space vehicles. According to the failure accidentally occurred during the operation phase (caused by the amplitude loading like vibration of engine,    \n \n\nearthquake, etc), flanged joint is becoming an interesting topic for researchers. In this thesis, pipe and its joints are discussed and analyzed by using theoretical and    \n \n\nnumerical analysis. The main purpose of this thesis is to investigate the sealing capability of the joints. Three kinds of bolted flange joints are discussed: Plate flange joint (PFJ), raised face weld neck flange (RFWNF) and compact flange joint (CFJ). PFJ and RFWNF are modeled by 3-dimentional solid element and it is analyzed under the static operating load, by using finite element package software (ANSYS v 12.1), while CFJ is discussed and evaluated based on the results of the existing research.    \n \n\nThere are two types of loadings applied in the joints, namely bolt preload and internal pressure. Bolt preload is modeled by applying thermal condition (decreasing the temperature) on the bolt solid elements, while internal pressure is represented by the combination of the axial load (hydrostatic end force) applied on the pipe cross section and radial pressure distributed uniformly on the internal surface of the pipe flanges. Important parameters under the investigation are the contact pressure or gasket pressure, and flange deflections which are affected by    \n \n\ngasket material properties, bolt preload and operating load (internal pressure).    \n \n\nIt has been demonstrated through the design criteria that the sealing capabilities of the joints depend on the contact pressure on gasket component,resulting from bolt preload and internal pressure. The contact pressure is required to be higher than hydrostatic pressure and it should be uniformly distributed. The variation of contact pressure due to the rotation of the flange and the material    \n \n\nproperties of the gasket play important roles in achieving a leak proof joint.    \n \n\nAccording to the results of finite element analysis (FEA) software (ANSYS v 12.1), it was found that the contact pressure is distributed non-uniformly; the high pressure concentration can be minimized by optimizing the stiffness of gasket material. There are two possible solutions for minimizing the non-uniform pressure: optimize stiffness based on the non-linearity behavior or stiffness based    \n \n\non Young\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s Modulus of gasket material.    \n \n\nReferring to the FEA results, the feasible non-linear material which can be selected for gasket design is a composite such as spiral wound gasket (AF and GF). This selection is based on the nonlinearity properties of material. However, due to the non-linearity, this kind of gasket is not recommended to be use with the equipments undergoing high dynamic vibration (like pump, turbine, and other rotating components). For example, if the gasket is suddenly compressed and decompressed, the gasket material may not recover to the original shape in a due, so there could be a leakage during the operation. To overcome this shortcoming, composite material with high flexibility property will be more preferable for adapting the high frequency and magnitude of loading.    \n \n\nBased on most optimum value of Young\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s Modulus and the working compressive stress of the gasket, it has been found that the materials like polymers (PTFE = lytetrafluoroethylene) and Elastomers (Polyurethane) are both in the design requirement. It has been demonstrated in [7] and [21] (Int. J. Pers. Ves. & Piping) that PTFE is considered as the best material due to its excellent properties such as non-pollution material, good flame resistance, very low rate of smoke generation, extremely long service life and very high corrosion resistant, etc.", "Daftar File": {"2011 TS PP TO DARA  1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/83403", "2011 TS PP TO DARA  1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/83404", "2011 TS PP TO DARA  1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/83405", "2011 TS PP TO DARA  1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/83406", "2011 TS PP TO DARA  1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/83407", "2011 TS PP TO DARA  1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/83408", "2011 TS PP TO DARA  1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/83409"}, "Penulis": "TO DARA (NIM : 23109014)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Prof. Dr. Ir.
