{"Nomor": 11249, "Judul": "ADAPTIVE NEURAL NETWORK CONTROL OF TWO DEGREE OF FREEDOM FLEXIBLE LINK USING RADIAL BASIS FUNCTION NETWORK", "Abstrak": "Control of flexible link robots is considered as one of the most challenging control problems. The tip (end-effector) of a flexible link vibrates easily as the link is moved from one position to another. However, accurate trajectory of the tip is demanded. Therefore, a suitable type of controller should be implemented on the two DOF (Degree of Freedom) flexible link. \n \n\nThe two DOF flexible link is a MIMO (Multi Input Multi Output) system which can be seen as two flexible links, each is a SIMO (Single Input Multi Output) system. Each flexible link has two observable outputs: joint position and tip deflection relative to the joint position. \n \n\nTwo controller schemes are proposed in this research. The first is by implementing PID controller for each link. The second is by implementing RBF (Radial Basis Function) network as a controller with a scheme called adaptive feedback control, also for each link. The learning process of the RBF network is performed online with EMRAN (Extended Minimal Resource Allocating Network) algorithm. Experimental Results have shown that the RBF network controller was able to improve its performance in the control of the two DOF flexible link after certain period of learning time.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "REYHAN ZANIS (NIM 13303052)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Ir.
