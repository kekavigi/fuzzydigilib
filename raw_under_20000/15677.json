{"Nomor": 15677, "Judul": "DYNAMIC DATA NORMALIZATION USING JSON OBJECT STRUCTURE", "Abstrak": "Normalization is an effective way to structure a pack of data which are going to be stored into a database. \n\nHowever dealing with dynamic data which its attributes are demanding to be able to be changed in flexible way \n\nis not an easy task. It is possible to create a full relationship among relations that exist, yet it will cost many more \n\nrows than it should be. \n\nThis paper is proposing a way to deal with those kinds of data by separating the relationship on the table \n\nstructure but rebuild the relationship on the data its self by using array structure which is then converted into \n\nJSON format.", "Daftar File": {"proceedings knsi 2013(89).pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/72940"}, "Penulis": "Feri Wijayanto", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["#CONTRIBUTOR#"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "normalization, json, dynamic data, array structure, object structure", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "24 Mar 2014"}
