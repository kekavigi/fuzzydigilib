{"Nomor": 13431, "Judul": "AN INVESTIGATION STUDY ON TIME TO DEPTH CONVERSION METHODS USING AVAILABLE VELOCITY DATA IN EMERALD FIELD", "Abstrak": "Time to depth conversion as a crucial stage in seismic interpretation has been carried out in various ways. Among the methods; average velocity, constant interval velocity, and linear interval velocity have been applied to depth-convert seismic times of Emerald Field in Northwest Java Basin. This study is aimed to investigate the accuracy of the three methods in predicting depth for a given velocity data availability. Different velocity datasets were used in each conversion method including velocity data from checkshot, stacking velocity and/or combination of both velocities. The error in depth predicted using the method of average velocity, constant interval velocity, and linear velocity was assessed by differentiating them to their actual values in 15 wells available in the survey. Horizons included in the depth conversion and accuracy assessment were Top Parigi, Top Upper Cibulakan, Top Baturaja, Top Talangakar, and Top Jatibarang.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ENIK PUJI LESTARI (NIM: 22308309)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. Alfian Bahar dan Adriansyah Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Geofisaka Terapan", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "depth conversion, velocity, checkshot, stacking velocity", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Vika Anastasya Kovariansi \u00a0\n                                     Vika Anastasya Kovariansi", "File": "9 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Feb 2012"}
