{"Nomor": 19340, "Judul": "PROJECT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DESIGN by UKP4 BASED ON PROJECT MANAGEMENT OFFICE (PMO) (CASE STUDY: DONGGI-SENORO GAS FIELD", "Abstrak": "Donggi-Senoro gas field has been found since 30 years ago, but the project has not been monetized. The main constraints of the project came from non-technical (external) factors. UKP4 (Unit Kerja Presiden Bidang Pengawasan dan Pengendalian Pembangunan) as the President's Delivery Unit (PDU) in charge with development monitoring and oversight had to debottleneck the Donggi-Senoro project in order for it to be realized.      \n \n \n \n\nThese problems can be solved by performing a comprehensive Project Management Office (PMO) to manage the Donggi-Senoro project. The government's PMO function plays an important role by providing decision support for decision maker and stakeholders involved in the Donggi-Senoro project.      \n \n \n \n\nThe methodologies of this final project are observation, internship and also field visit to Donggi-Senoro project. This final project focuses on designing the project management system for UKP4 by using PMO framework.      \n \n \n \n\nThe research provides suggestion on PMO functions for UKP4 to manage the project. UKP4 has basically conducted most of the PMO functions, as evidenced from the achievement of gas allocation and FID of Donggi-Senoro project. The proposed PMO design can be applied by UKP4, which is expected to increase the project progress, reduce the constraints on the project, increase and develop internal process, encourages attitude to learn and develop employee capabilities.      \n \n \n \n\nThe PMO implementation plan will take approximately 2 years. UKP4 has to prepare all the supporting activities before implementing the PMO system. The supports from top leaders are needed, so PMO system can work properly.", "Daftar File": {"2012 TS PP RIZAL NURZAMAN 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/96909", "2012 TS PP RIZAL NURZAMAN 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/96910", "2012 TS PP RIZAL NURZAMAN 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/96911", "2012 TS PP RIZAL NURZAMAN 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/96912", "2012 TS PP RIZAL NURZAMAN 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/96913", "2012 TS PP RIZAL NURZAMAN 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/96914"}, "Penulis": "RIZAL NURZAMAN (NIM : 29109376)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dermawan Wibisono, Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Administrasi Bisnis", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Debottleneck, Donggi-Senoro Project, Project Management, Project Management Office (PMO), UKP4", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "6 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
