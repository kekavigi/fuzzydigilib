{"Nomor": 13832, "Judul": "PT. X LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS PLANT CONSTRUCTION PROJECT FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS", "Abstrak": "Liquefied Natural Gas is a complementary item for crude oil which had been used for decades worldwide. It has its own place in the world of energy, beside coal or even nuclear power. It is very famous because of its cleanliness and of course because it is renewable. Liquefied Natural Gas has its own loyal customers, such as the Japanese, which had been using the Liquefied Natural Gas for decades to support its country electricity activity. In Japan, the cost for electricity is relatively high; because the electricity company in Japan dares to pay every single damaged done if the electricity supply for the country is cut off, from the rotten food in the refrigerator, until any other electronic appliances in the house, offices or building which was damaged. That is why the Japanese dares to buy Liquefied Natural Gas from Indonesia with a relatively high price too, just to make sure that the Liquefied Natural Gas will never cut off too.", "Daftar File": {"2010 TA PP SATRIA REZKY PRATAMA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/61396", "2010 TA PP SATRIA REZKY PRATAMA 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/61397", "2010 TA PP SATRIA REZKY PRATAMA 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/61398", "2010 TA PP SATRIA REZKY PRATAMA 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/61399", "2010 TA PP SATRIA REZKY PRATAMA 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/61400", "2010 TA PP SATRIA REZKY PRATAMA 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/61401", "2010 TA PP SATRIA REZKY PRATAMA 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/61402"}, "Penulis": "SATRIA REZKY PRATAMA (NIM 19007093)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Deddy Priatmodjo Koesrindartoto, Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "LNG, Feasibility, Monte Carlo Methods", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Vika Anastasya Kovariansi \u00a0\n                                     Vika Anastasya Kovariansi", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Jul 2012"}
