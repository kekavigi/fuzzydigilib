{"Nomor": 11094, "Judul": "FEASIBILITY AND DESIGN FOR CONTROL OF WASTE WATER FROM CASSAVA FLOUR MILLS IN CENTRAL LAMPUNG REGENCY IN INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "Lingering waste water of cassava flour mills in Central Lampung Regency of Indonesia has caused environmental problems. The regulations put into force in an attempt to protect environment have failed to lead to satisfactory results due to various reasons described in the text. This thesis attempts to examine merits and demerits of alternative means to protect environment, focusing on the feasibility and design of economic instrument, and ultimately advocates an environmental tax in consideration of local conditions. Comparing to other instruments such as trade of emission permit, economic incentives for abatement and voluntary agreement, an environmental tax appears more worth consideration from both theoretical and practical viewpoints. Consequently, this thesis is designed to develop an environmental tax scheme in a way to fit with situations in Indonesia. Besides the scheme itself, the thesis emphasizes that efforts should be made to create long-run cooperative climate that is conducive to the success of the scheme by fostering cooperation between government and the industry as well as the industry and citizens.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "NURMAMI DARMAN (NIM 25406049)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Teti Armiati Argo, Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Perencanaan Wilayah dan Kota", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Arsitektur, Perencanaan dan Pengembangan Kebijakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "waste water control, environmental tax.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Vika Anastasya Kovariansi \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Okt 2017"}
