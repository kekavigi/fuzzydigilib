When the employees did not perform at their best, we have to assess the lacking point from the employees. This is important because it means that there is ineffectiveness in the company performance. As this research focuses in non- financial measurement, Employee Value Performance is the proven model that could determine employee engagement. The idea of this model is to search for an improvement in various employee expectation areas : leadership, job, development opportunity, rewards, fair value performance, culture and values. The way to know whether the variable needs improvement is to compare those variables with price. Price is the sacrifice that the employees give in order to receive their expectation.      \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe result shows that all areas of the six variables need improvement. Every single sub- variable that builds the variable is analyzed to find the conclusion of the improvements needed. Some of the variables are influencing other variables, and also attracted each other. In the end, the improvement needed falls into Five Areas of Improvements: assignment improvement, evaluation and rewards improvement, team improvement, leader improvement, and training improvement.", "Daftar File": {"2013 TS PP ANASTASIA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/86565", "2013 TS PP ANASTASIA 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/86566", "2013 TS PP ANASTASIA 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/86567", "2013 TS PP ANASTASIA 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/86568", "2013 TS PP ANASTASIA 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/86569", "2013 TS PP ANASTASIA 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/86570"}, "Penulis": "ANASTASIA (NIM: 29111130)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Ir.
