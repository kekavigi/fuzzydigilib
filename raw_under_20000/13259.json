{"Nomor": 13259, "Judul": "THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITION OF PT X ON ITS ECONOMIC VALUE ADDED", "Abstrak": "The purpose of this research is to measure the post acquisition performance of PT X, by comparing the financial performance of this company before and after acquisition. Besides using conventional accountings, which are ROA (Return on Assets) and ROE (Return on Equity) to analyze its performance, this research also uses EVA (Economic Value Added) to measure the true economic profit for this company. Then the conventional measurement system is going to be compared with the EVA to analyze if the acquisition really brings good impacts to the company and creates wealth maximization to the shareholders, because even it has positive net income and financial ratios, it doesn't mean that it operates profits and creates value to the shareholder until it was balanced with the result of EVA. The writer found that the conventional measurement system is well balanced with the EVA analysis.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ANGGARA PRADHANA (NIM 19006046)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Isrochmani, M.Acc."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Return on Equity, Returnon Assets, Economic Value Added", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Vika Anastasya Kovariansi \u00a0\n                                     Vika Anastasya Kovariansi", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Jun 2012"}
