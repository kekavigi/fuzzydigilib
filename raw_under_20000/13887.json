This is one of the greatest media for advertiser to place an ad for because it also could take the advertisement from one side of the world to another side in also just a couple second. To place an ad on the internet, we need a site or a place. Facebook as one of the most popular social networks provide a place to place an ad, which further will be called Facebook advertising. But there is a need to study how is the effectiveness of Facebook advertising so that advertiser will know what should be expected once they place an ad on Facebook advertising. Therefore this study objective is to measure the effectiveness of Facebook advertising at ITB in term of the frequency of reading, clicking, and buying from Facebook advertising. The study of reading, clicking, and buying will be based on AIDA model. Attention will be positioned as reading, interest and desire will be referred as clicking, and action will be referred as buying in this research. To know the recall of Facebook advertising, brand recall theory will also be used. This is to know how deep the respondents remember about Facebook advertising. After analyzing the data, can be found that Facebook advertising is actually an effective media to place an ad for. With 76% people that are reading about the Facebook advertising, this could be good for strengthening the brand recall of the ads. There are also 26% of people that is actually clicking on Facebook advertising, which is good because people already interested about the ads and want to know more about the ads. The percentage of people that is actually buying from Facebook ads is 13%, which is also good for increasing sales. The last finding is that even people has been reading, clicking and buying, 75% respondent think that Facebook advertising did not helps them in shopping. Which is pretty interesting because there is actually 76% read, but many of them still think it did not helps them in shopping. This could also caused by either they did not find a suitable advertising at Facebook or the information given at Facebook advertising is not enough.", "Daftar File": {"2010 TA PP VINCENT MELVIN 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/61784", "2010 TA PP VINCENT MELVIN 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/61785", "2010 TA PP VINCENT MELVIN 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/61786", "2010 TA PP VINCENT MELVIN 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/61787", "2010 TA PP VINCENT MELVIN 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/61788", "2010 TA PP VINCENT MELVIN 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/61789", "2010 TA PP VINCENT MELVIN 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/61790"}, "Penulis": "VINCENT MELVIN (NIM 19007089)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Budi Permadi Iskandar, MSP."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Facebook advertising, Recall, Reading, Clicking, Buying", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Vika Anastasya Kovariansi \u00a0\n                                     Vika Anastasya Kovariansi", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Jul 2012"}
