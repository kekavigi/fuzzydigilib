The outputs of this research are the portfolio which generates the highest return also turns out to have the best perfomance among other portfolios based on Sharpe Ratio and Jensen Alpha. This portfolio has a Sharpe Ratio of 19,59% with Jensen Aplha of 0,37%.", "Daftar File": {"2012 TA PP DODDY RACHMAT 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/89585", "2012 TA PP DODDY RACHMAT 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/89586", "2012 TA PP DODDY RACHMAT 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/89584", "2012 TA PP DODDY RACHMAT 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/89583", "2012 TA PP DODDY RACHMAT 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/89582", "2012 TA PP DODDY RACHMAT 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/89581", "2012 TA PP DODDY RACHMAT 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/89580"}, "Penulis": "DODDY RACHMAT (NIM : 19009154)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing :Anggoro Budi Nugroho, MBA"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Portfolio Construction, Performance Analysis, Sharpe Ratio, Treynor\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s Measure, Jensen Alpha.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Alice D", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Jun 2015"}
