{"Nomor": 10595, "Judul": "EXPERIMENTAL STUDY ON LIQUID FLOW MEASUREMENT USING CLAMP-ON ULTRASONIC FLOWMETER", "Abstrak": "Clamp-on ultrasonic flowmeter has become a versatile non destructive evaluation instrument when applying the measurement process. The theory of transit time ultrasonic is formed from ultrasonic wave which is beamed by transmitter and detected by receiver, then the transit time will be measured and the flow velocity is counted based on transit time at the measurement length. Set up experimental were done by comparing the two most used method of clamp-on ultrasonic flowmeter i.e. reflective mode (V-Method) and diagonal mode (Z-Method). \n \n \n \n \n \n\nIn this study, reflective (V-Method) and diagonal (Z-Method) modes of clamp-on ultrasonic flowmeter were used to measure the volume flow rate in the process flow mini plant. The experiment shows that for small sizes pipe as the measurement object, the reflective mounting mode is more appropriate than the diagonal mode based on physical and statistical analysis. From transit time experiment result, the precision value is given 2.35% as the best result along with diagonal mounting mode precision value 5.92% as the less good result. Index Capability value from the reflective mode stands on 0.78 which is not a capable process from the specification given; even it is the best Index Capability result between others. As the deeper analysis, clamp on ultrasonic flowmeter will works on all pipe size range as long as implementing the proper mounting mode.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "HENDRY PRATAMA (NIM 13304028)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Ir.
