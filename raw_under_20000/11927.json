{"Nomor": 11927, "Judul": "ANALISIS STRUKTUR VENT BOOM PADA ANJUNGAN LEPAS PANTAI", "Abstrak": "ABSTRACT:  \n \n\nVent boom is part of offshore platform equipment towers used for dissipating the residual gas into the air. Vent boom should be united with whole structure of platform itself, hence, should be treated as structural component. Every structural component of offshore platform should be resisted from any loading during the installation and operation.   \n \n\nThe installation process begin when the vent boom being lifted into the offshore barge then being transported to the offshore platform and being lifted again before it being welded. During this process, vent boom structure should resist from any loads make up from the gravity and the ocean motions accepted by barge.   \n \n\nDuring the offshore platform operation, at normal and extreme conditions or even during the earthquake, vent boom should resist from any chance of structural failure. Because of that, structural analysis will be necessary to know the resistant of the vent boom, thus it will not make any losses for the company or hazardous event by structural failure.   \n \n\nTo verify the stress level on the vent boom, there are four analyses should be perfomed. There are in-place, seismic, lifting, and transportation analysis. Each structural analysis is performed using SACS program.   \n \n\nThe computer program is used to perform the stiffness analysis and the structural member code checks of the vent boom model. The verifications of the stress level on the model were analyzed using the Maximum Unity Check (UC), where all members and joints should complies the pre-requirement of UC less or equal to 1.0.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Budi Muhammad Habibi (NIM 155 04 007)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Rildova, Ph.D.", "Koordinator: Krisnaldi Idris, Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Kelautan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Sipil dan Lingkungan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Offshore platform, vent boom, structural analysis, modeling, Unity Check (UC)", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ena Sukmana \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "9 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
