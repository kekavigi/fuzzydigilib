{"Nomor": 13798, "Judul": "ECONOMICALLY FEASIBILITY STUDY OF SPBU ESTABLISHMENT BY PT. X AT BEKASI INTERNATIONAL INDUSTRIAL ESTATE AREA", "Abstrak": "Several data are needed to process the analysis. The data are SPBU components, cost components, market research data, economic factors, and assumptions. Analysis started by calculating the demand based on market research data. SPBU components and the cost components could be identified after the demand calculation had been done. By using economic factors such inflation rate, wages growth, deposit rate, and vehicle growth, the cash flows projection for ten years period could be made. Then, the next step is finding the NPV, IRR, and PP. To find those variables, hurdle rate is used as the discount factor. Hurdle rate is the minimal rate of return that must be achieved in this investment.After the data analysis had been made, the NPV and IRR show that this project is economically feasible but the payback period is quite long. PT. X should accept the project but they must concern about the change of selling price. The change of selling price could affect the change NPV and IRR greatly. Beside the change of selling price, the other factors that could affect the NPV and IRR are demand quantity and fuel shrink cost. Several preventive actions to minimize the loss that caused by the change of those factors had been made in this economically feasibility study", "Daftar File": {"2010 TA PP R.
