With passenger growth up to 5.7% per year expected by 2030 passengers in and out of airports will reach 141 million people. So far, the transportation route in and out of the airport is only via the highway road (toll or non-toll) that will pass ring road Jakarta. Currently, the growth of vehicles in Jakarta is very surprising to cause severe traffic jam. The traffic jam that often occured is also affected either directly or indirectly to the traffic conditions and from the Soekarno-Hatta Airport    \n \n \n \n\nIndonesia Government through Presidential Decree number 83 of 2011 assigned PT Indonesia Railway to build railway transportation infrastructure through a circular route Jakarta to Soekarno Hatta. The purpose is to develop alternative transportation to help reduce transport problems in the future.    \n \n \n \n\nFor PT KAI itself, as the government-owned company that has a public service obligation (PSO), the project must be done, but there will be a question of whether this project will give positive or negative impact for the company in the future, especially in terms of financial performance. Therefore, to analyze the value added of this project, the future financial statements between if PT KAI do the project and if they don\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019t do the project must be compared.    \n \n \n \n\nAs a first step analyzed the financial condition of PT KAI current through the analysis of time series, cross section, a ranking based on two methodologies (BUMN & Moody's), and the current capital structure. Furthermore, the feasibility and demand analysis of the project will be presented as information.    \n \n \n \n\nTo determine how much value a given project, the projected of current consolidated financial statements and financial statement projections of the project will be conducted. Next step will be compare and analyze the results of these projections which are the consolidated financial statements without the project with projected financial statements consolidation plus project. From the results of the comparison will be observed whether the project also increased ratings of PT KAI.    \n \n \n \n\nThis research provides business solutions to PT KAI to improve financial performance and corporate value by increasing the financial indicators and investment rating. In the end, the project can be roled as a business solution to improve financial performance in the future.", "Daftar File": {"2012 TS PP Adhi Nugraha (29110409) 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/85472", "2012 TS PP Adhi Nugraha (29110409) 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/85473", "2012 TS PP Adhi Nugraha (29110409) 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/85474", "2012 TS PP Adhi Nugraha (29110409) 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/85475", "2012 TS PP Adhi Nugraha (29110409) 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/85476", "2012 TS PP Adhi Nugraha (29110409) 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/85477"}, "Penulis": "ADHI NUGRAHA (NIM: 29110409)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Ir.
