{"Nomor": 15964, "Judul": "INITIAL DEVELOPMENT OF A COAXIAL ROTOR MICRO AERIAL VEHICLE FOR INDOOR APPLICATIONS", "Abstrak": "Indoor application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle requires a specific type, size and configuration of vehicle that has adequate maneuverability and controllability to operate in indoor environment with possible obstacles of different shape and size. A design requirements and objectives of a Micro Aerial Vehicle for this kind of mission have been defined. In this research, a configuration design for an indoor application MAV was conducted to determine the most suitable configuration. A coaxial rotor MAV configuration was then chosen as the MAV platform.  \n \n\nA calculation method based on Blade Element Momentum Theory is built to estimate the aerodynamic performance of coaxial configuration. The calculation results were then compared with results from computational method and experiments for validation.  \n \n\nAn initial closed \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2013 loop control design was developed and implemented to build a functional prototype of MAV with ability of semi autonomous control. A simple altitude hold control algorithm was chosen as a test for autonomous control.", "Daftar File": {"2008 TS PP HUYNH PHUOC THIEN 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/74648", "2008 TS PP HUYNH PHUOC THIEN 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/74649", "2008 TS PP HUYNH PHUOC THIEN 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/74650", "2008 TS PP HUYNH PHUOC THIEN 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/74651", "2008 TS PP HUYNH PHUOC THIEN 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/74652", "2008 TS PP HUYNH PHUOC THIEN 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/74653", "2008 TS PP HUYNH PHUOC THIEN 1-BAB 6.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/74654", "2008 TS PP HUYNH PHUOC THIEN 1-BAB 7.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/74655", "2008 TS PP HUYNH PHUOC THIEN 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/74656"}, "Penulis": "HUYNH PHUOC THIEN (NIM : 23606011)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Taufiq Mulyanto"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Mesin", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Coaxial helicopter, MAV, indoor application, rotor performance study, autonomous control", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "9 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
