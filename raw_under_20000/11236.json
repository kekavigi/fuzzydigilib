{"Nomor": 11236, "Judul": "SIMULATION FOR CT IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION USING ALGEBRAIC RECONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUE", "Abstrak": "Image reconstruction is reconstructing an image from a set of measurements (projection data). Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART) is one of the iterative processes that repeat a series of updates to the reconstructed image. This technique can be more amenable to the situation where the projections are not uniformly distributed over 1800 or 3600, or it is not possible to measure a large number of projections. However, this technique is time consuming. Therefore, to make it more effective there is a need to find the optimum number of iteration. In the other side, we use other method to generate projection data from model. The reconstructed images will be evaluated using its image correlation value. The purpose of this study is to apply a technique for establishing optimum number of iterations and optimum number of angles to be used for reconstructing image. At this stage of the study, the selection is performed to demonstrate that neglecting some specific angles can be useful in achieving improved image quality.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "RENI R.
