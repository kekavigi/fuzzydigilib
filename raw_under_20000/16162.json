{"Nomor": 16162, "Judul": "IMPLEMENTASI WEB SERVICE COMPOSITE (STUDI KASUS APLIKASI PARIWISATA)", "Abstrak": "Based on research conducted by Kung-Kiu Lau and Cuong Tran that more than 70% of applications in the \n\nUnited Kingdom is still not integrated, so that ice information increase and data exchange between applications \n\nis inconsistent. To be able to exchange data between applications, each application should be able to provide \n\nservices as a service provider to the other application as a service consumer, such as web service. Web service is \n\na software system designed to support interoperability and interactions between systems on a network. Web \n\nservice is used as a facility provided by a web to provide services in the form of information to other systems, so \n\nthat other systems can interact with the system through a service provided by a system of web service providers. \n\nData and information needs are often not only from one application, but can be derived from two or more \n\napplications. Integration two or more web services into one web service called composite web service. This \n\nresearch will implement a prototype composite web service, which is one web service that integrate three web \n\nservices (web service hotel, car rental and tourism information) in one web service in a tourism case study.", "Daftar File": {"proceedings knsi 2013(63).pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/75871"}, "Penulis": "Jasman Pardede, Uunk Ungkawa, Adil Kurnia Ramdan", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["#CONTRIBUTOR#"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "ice information, web service, web service provider, web service composite", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Mar 2014"}
