The scattering eciencies are calculated in the visible region using discrete dipole approximation. Checking for the convergence is limited by the com puting facility and the acceptable number of cells is 11536. The computed resultst well with analytical Mie theory. The scattering eciencies are red-shifted and  has higher peak for larger nanospheres. We also include the scattering calculation for two separated spheres and it showed strong eld enhancement. The results for Si(dielectric) nanospheres are included as a comparison.", "Daftar File": {"2014 TA PP RYAN SENTOSA 1- COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/97294", "2014 TA PP RYAN SENTOSA 1- BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/97293", "2014 TA PP RYAN SENTOSA 1- BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/97292", "2014 TA PP RYAN SENTOSA 1- BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/97295", "2014 TA PP RYAN SENTOSA 1- BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/97296", "2014 TA PP RYAN SENTOSA 1- BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/97297", "2014 TA PP RYAN SENTOSA 1- PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/97298"}, "Penulis": "RYAN SENTOSA (NIM: 10210073)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Alexander Iskandar, Ph.D"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Gold, Discrete, Dipole, Approximation", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
