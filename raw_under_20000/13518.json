{"Nomor": 13518, "Judul": "TIME LAPSE FEASIBILITY SEISMIC STUDY OF GAS CARBONATES RESERVOIR IN TETRA FIELD, INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "Time-lapse seismic monitoring is an important technology for reservoir management, especially for Enhanced Hydrocarbon Recovery (EHR). A time-lapse feasibility seismic study is needed before performing the project survey in Tetra Field. I modeled the water drive during the production stages for two scenarios, first is when the lower part of carbonate reservoir has gas residual 20% and the second one is when there is no residual gas. The fluid substitution via Gassmann's equation is used to create the scenarios and shows a significant change to zero-offset reflectivity (the intercept) but only minor changes to the AVO gradient. The change in seismic response is caused mainly by the density change during the fluid injection. At Top Mantawa Member (top of target interval), greater decrease of amplitude by 47% was obtained from the change in water saturation of 22% to 100%. At Top 1st GWC (base of target interval), there is a change of amplitude polarity where the water saturation changes from 22% to 100%. The effect of seismic response changes significantly when the water saturation obtained exceeded 80% because the acoustic impedance difference of water saturation from 80% to 100% is greater than from the change of water saturation from 22% to 80%. To make the model approach with a real subsurface condition, noise level, geometrical spreading and transmission loss parameters are used into the synthetic model.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "HELMI INDRAJAYA (NIM 22308319)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. Sigit Sukmono dan Artini Sukotjo, M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Geofisaka Terapan", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "time-lapse seismic, enhanced hydrocarbon recovery", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Vika Anastasya Kovariansi \u00a0\n                                     Vika Anastasya Kovariansi", "File": "11 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Feb 2012"}
