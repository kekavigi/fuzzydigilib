{"Nomor": 13774, "Judul": "LABORATORY ANALYSIS OF COMBINATION OF VIBRATION STIMULATION AND SURFACTANT INJECTION AT HIGH PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE", "Abstrak": "Vibroseismic should be considered as one of IOR (Improved Oil Recovery) methods. For the last few years, many researches try to explain its mechanism using vibration stimulation laboratory work of core samples. To the author knowledge that we believe it could reduce surface tension physically, the related mechanism works on reducing capillary forces and surface tension between fluid and rock, increasing porosity, permeability, and oil mobility. In this study, we did laboratory experiment in combining vibroseismic and surfactant injection that has been known widely of reducing surface tension chemically, to pursue our hypothesis that is mechanism could work mutually to reduce the surface tension.This experimental research is done at high pressure and temperature, which are 70 oC and 100 psig. Based on the previous study, this study applied the optimum frequency of the vibration stimulation for the typical core samples that is 15 Hz. The results of this experiment show the best method to gain the best RF is the combination of vibration stimulation and surfactant injection simultaneously, i.e., 46.05%. Those results are also shown that there is characteristic change, where the lowest permeability and porosity decreasing generally happen in vibrated core samples.", "Daftar File": {"2009 TA PP REVLIN REVELINO PRIMADHANI 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/60964"}, "Penulis": "REVLIN RIVELINO PRIMADHANI (NIM 12204052)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Ir.
