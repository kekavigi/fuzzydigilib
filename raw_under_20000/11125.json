{"Nomor": 11125, "Judul": "ROLE OF LOW LEVEL GOVERNMENT IN COUNTER-TERRORISM", "Abstrak": "Post 9/11 Tragedy, terrorism is considered as the main threat for security with United States as the main proponent. 9/11 Tragedy was then considered as the benchmark of the so called New Terrorism. It has three main characters, which are global reach, network-centric organization, and it has a new paradigm which centered on religious issues. In Indonesia, the New Terrorism is also becomes a threat referring to the large numbers of bombing attacks by the terrorist group which inflicts large numbers of casualties.Response from the government at that time, Megawati's government followed by Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's government, is mainly focuses at macro level. The most notable thing is the creation of Anti Terror Desk whose tasks is to coordinates anti terror activity in the country. In general there are no comprehensive policies about counter terrorist strategy from general policy to mechanism in detail.Terrorist member could still conduct their activities undetected by the security authority. The main problem for this matter is the lack of information to support the security authority in dealing with the terrorist. Additional problem is that the terrorist group could operate in the local community without detected because the LLG (Lower Level Government, i.e. Neighborhood and Community Administrative) in the local community are not conducting their tasks properly as the administrative authority. This is factual in Tamansari Case. Thus, the role of LLG in counter terrorist activity in Indonesia is the topic of this thesis.To elaborate the role of LLG in counter terrorist activity in Indonesia, this thesis will use Qualitative Research as its methodology. To collect data, this thesis will use observation, document study, and interview in order to get comprehensive data. To analyze the data that have been collected, this thesis will use three theories as tool of analysis. The first theory is the Griffith Three Principles for Countering Terrorism which consists of Location, Isolation, and Eradication Principles. The second theory is Community Policing Theory that discuss about the role of local community and also LLG in developing the security in their area. The last theory is Non Zero Sum Game of Game Theory that discusses the relative win in involving LLG in counter terrorist activity.Using three theories above, LLG has an important role in counter terrorist activity especially in Location and Isolation principles of Griffith Principles for Countering Terrorism. This role is also known as Community Policing Roles. The Isolation principle is best explained using Non Zero Sum Game of Game Theory because it can shows the relative win in letting the terrorist group operates in the local community for a greater objective of disclosing the entire network of the terrorist group.Overall, the role of LLG in counter terrorist activity is very important. But it needs further arrangement in concrete policy especially counter terrorist policy. The policy must state a clear measurement about the role of the LLG in counter terrorist activity and how is the mechanism.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "PASREP NURHADI (NIM 24005056)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. Ir.
