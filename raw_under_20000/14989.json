Many analysts believe that this disruption creates multiple effects experienced by all industries, including IT industry.  \n \n\nToday, International Business Machines (IBM) is putting its best effort to battle against the effect of the current global economic recession while at the same time preparing itself aggressively to grab new opportunities that lies behind the turmoil. It remixes its businesses in order to move to the emerging higher-value spaces. Services now become more and more important to the overall IBM business.  \n \n\nAs one of the IBM services business, maintenance has traditionally become a captive contributor of IBM services revenue. It consists of a range of services from product maintenance to solution support to maintain and improve the availability of client\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s infrastructure.  \n \n\nAs an impact of the declining IT investment budget of the clients during the current economic recession, maintenance plays more important role in IBM revenue structure. While clients postpone their investment on new IT infrastructures, they tend to focus more on maintaining their old ones. Thus, more growth and wider penetration is expected from maintenance business.  \n \n\nThe objective of this research is to analyze field engineers\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019 motivation in looking for maintenance business opportunities proactively. The objective is based on the fact that field engineers are supposed to be in a good position to contribute more on maintenance business penetration. To achieve the objective, this research collects and analyzes the data using qualitative method, and then proposes recommendations.  \n \n\nBased on the analysis, this research proposes seven points of recommendations. The recommendations relate to job redesign, standard operating procedure, training program, performance feedback, Leads Program, town-hall business review, and appreciation.", "Daftar File": {"2009 TS PP ARIAYUDA SATRIAGORA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/68900", "2009 TS PP ARIAYUDA SATRIAGORA 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/68901", "2009 TS PP ARIAYUDA SATRIAGORA 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/68902", "2009 TS PP ARIAYUDA SATRIAGORA 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/68903", "2009 TS PP ARIAYUDA SATRIAGORA 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/68904", "2009 TS PP ARIAYUDA SATRIAGORA 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/68905"}, "Penulis": "ARIAYUDA SATRIAGORA (NIM : 29107209)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Ir.
