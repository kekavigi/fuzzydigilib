{"Nomor": 17629, "Judul": "FLIPPING YOUR CLASSROOM WITH TECHNOLOGY", "Abstrak": "Educators in all level are often challenged by their teaching responsibilities as they must teach students with \n\nvarious levels of motivation, prior knowledge, skills, and capabilities to absorb the course materials. The flipped \n\nclassroom concept offers a potential solution for educators to accommodate these diverse students. A flipped \n\nclassroom is a classroom where the materials are learned by the students individually at their own pace prior to \n\nthe classroom meetings so that the face-to-face classroom meetings can be used for more engaging learning \n\nactivities. The flipped classroom concept has given some positive promises for today\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s educators. With the help \n\nof technology and the availability of reusable learning objects in the internet, educators can give this method a \n\ntry. This paper discusses the flipped classroom concept, pros and cons on implementing the flipped classroom, \n\nsome tips to prepare the first flipped classroom, available resources that are ready-to-use, and several potential \n\nactive learning instructional strategies to be used in the face-to-face classroom meetings.", "Daftar File": {"proceedings knsi 2013(53).pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/84647"}, "Penulis": "Yenni Djajalaksana, Francisca H.
