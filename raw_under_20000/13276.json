{"Nomor": 13276, "Judul": "A NEW PROPOSED PLATEAU GAS PRODUCTION RATE CORRELATION OF A GAS WELL PRODUCING SIMULTANEOUSLY GAS-WATER PHASE UNDER BOTTOM-WATER-DRIVE RESERVOIR", "Abstrak": "The purpose of this study is to find a new proposed correlation to estimate gas production rate and recovery factor at the end of production time in bottom-water-drive gas reservoir. These equations were generated by constructing 2-D reservoir model for 2 phase flow (water-gas) and doing sensitivity analysis to several parameters such as absolute permeability (k) and vertical to horizontal permeability ratio (kv/kh). By using many combinations of production rate and permeability, the results are analized to generate the correlation. The resulted correlation is a polynomial second order having an average error of 8.1 % for Q equation and 1.06 % for RF equation.", "Daftar File": {"2010 TA PP ARASY AZ ZARIAT 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/57518"}, "Penulis": "ARASY AZ ZARIAT (NIM 12206029)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. Ir.
