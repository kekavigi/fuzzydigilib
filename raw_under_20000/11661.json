{"Nomor": 11661, "Judul": "WAYS TO CONTROL MUNICIPAL BONDS ISSUE FOR LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT", "Abstrak": "In recent years, the Government of Indonesia (GOI) has started decentralization by giving more autonomy for the use of local borrowing to the regional governments. However, the new revision of decentralization law by establishing limits and obligating government approval makes the centralized control over local borrowing. Without sufficient authority in issuing local bonds, it will increase dependency on intergovernmental transfer and undermine the efforts of regional governments to prevent excessive and unproductive spending. This would make increasing the outstanding debt like in Japan and make the system of local public finance become unsustainable. This study analyzes the current situation and problems of the system in Japan, with the goal of helping the policy makers stimulate insights for Indonesia's practice of local borrowing.The local borrowing system of Japan has similarity with Indonesia. Japan and Indonesia follow a hybrid system of basic form: the Local Assembly approval and some debt ratio limitations. The regional fiscal condition in Indonesia indicates that it will follow Japan experience. The combination of fiscal equalization and borrowing, heavy dependence on transfers and tax sharing, lack of budget transparency and inadequate flow of information has contributed to fiscal indiscipline and common pool problem. It can come up to the soft budget constraint problem that can create uncontrollable debt. In recent years, there has been a big change in the situation of local borrowing in Japan and with the help of joint cooperation institution the central government has succeeded to improve regional governments in managing their local bond management. Through comparing the both cases, this study suggests to maintain the approval system with a strong and direct evaluation and monitoring system which is part of regulatory function at central government and promote joint cooperation with the private financial institution for the implementation in the earlier process of local borrowing system in Indonesia. Then, with carefully manage, control and regulate the local fiscal management, it should be followed by increasing fiscal autonomy of regional government to sustain their fiscal condition. With that autonomy, regional governments can increase their credibility to borrow money from the bond market.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "YUDIANTO (NIM 25406066)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Prof. Yonosuke Hara, Prof. Hirofumi Takada, and Prof. Pradono"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Perencanaan Wilayah dan Kota", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Arsitektur, Perencanaan dan Pengembangan Kebijakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Decentralization, Local Borrowing, Local Bond, Soft Budget Constraint.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Vika Anastasya Kovariansi \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Okt 2017"}
