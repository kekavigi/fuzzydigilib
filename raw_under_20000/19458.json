This situation emerge offset practice or \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2018industrial compensation\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019 from the acquisition of foreign defence equipment. This \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2018industrial compensation\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019 is seek by the developing country, as an opportunity to builds their defence industrialization. This research focused on he offset role on the enhancement of Indonesian defence industrial capability with PT Dirgantara Indonesia as the case study. In general, offset could be divided into two types, direct and indirect, which on both types, transfer technology plays a big role by giving \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2018know how\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019 process to the buyer country. In the practice, there are a lot of consideration needs to be done in demanding offset, like government regulations, defence acquisition process, or strategic industry development plan. The development of strategic industry in Indonesia also used offset as a tool for their industrialization in the process of technological absorptions. For example, PT Dirgantara Indonesia used licensing and joint-venture as its vehicle in mastering technology in designing an aircraft. Not only that, PT Dirgantara Indonesia has also enjoying manufacturing projects as an offset for buying F16 fighter aircraft from General Dynamics. The offset project that has been granted to PT Dirgantara Indonesia brings value to the development of PT Dirgantara Indonesia as Indonesia\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s strategic industry, especially in the ability to manufacture and the ability to build an aircraft.", "Daftar File": {"2009 TS PP SEZSY YUNIORRITA 1- BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/97740", "2009 TS PP SEZSY YUNIORRITA 1- BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/97741", "2009 TS PP SEZSY YUNIORRITA 1- BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/97742", "2009 TS PP SEZSY YUNIORRITA 1- BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/97743", "2009 TS PP SEZSY YUNIORRITA 1- BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/97744", "2009 TS PP SEZSY YUNIORRITA 1- COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/97745", "2009 TS PP SEZSY YUNIORRITA 1- PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/97746"}, "Penulis": "SEZSY YUNIORRITA (NIM : 24070028)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Sonny Yuliar", "Prof. Ron Matthews"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Studi Pembangunan", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Arsitektur, Perencanaan dan Pengembangan Kebijakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Offset, Defence Industry, Dirgantara Indonesia, Technology Transfer", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
