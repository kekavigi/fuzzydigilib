Using stepwise multiple linear regressions with data from 2003 to 2009, the data analysis result gives six models. The best model is the sixth model that has an R square for 0.94 and it eliminates two independent variables that are not having a significant relationship with net profit which are non-performing loan and business per employee. This final project indicates that the rest of the independent variables such as spread, non-interest income, loan per deposit ratio, bad debt allowance, operating expense and profit per employee are having a significant relationship with net profit.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "HAZRATI RAMADHANY (NIM 19007028)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Deddy P.
