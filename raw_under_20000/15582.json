The purpose of safety assessment is to ensure that all risks of failure have been considered, to understand how the failure happens, and to identify its probability. This assessment is qualitative and quantitative. So far, safety assessment for lateral directional flight control system of WiSE-8 craft has not been carried out.   \n \n \n\nSafety assessment is conducted based on the procedure described in SAE ARP4761 document which is recommended by GL Section 11 and IMO Circular 1054. Safety assessment process consists of three steps i.e., Functional Hazard   \n \n \n\nAssessment (FHA), Preliminary System Safety Assessment (PSSA) and System Safety Assessment (SSA). PSSA is not conducted in this safety assessment process. An open loop simulation is developed to verify the result of FHA.   \n \n \n\nSimulation with WiSE EFS is also performed for verifying the result of the open loop simulation.   \n \n \n\nThe result of FHA shows that the jamming of aileron and rudder control surface in deflected position failure mode is classified as a catastrophic failure. This classification matches with the result of an open loop simulation. The Open loop simulation does not represent all characteristics of WiSE-8 movements yet because the altitude of the craft is assumed to be constant. The result of SSA step shows that design of lateral directional flight control system WiSE-8 craft has   \n \n \n\nsatisfied the safety objectives and safety requirements.", "Daftar File": {"2009 TS PP EVITA RATNA WATI 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/72346", "2009 TS PP EVITA RATNA WATI 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/72347", "2009 TS PP EVITA RATNA WATI 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/72348", "2009 TS PP EVITA RATNA WATI 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/72349", "2009 TS PP EVITA RATNA WATI 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/72350", "2009 TS PP EVITA RATNA WATI 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/72351", "2009 TS PP EVITA RATNA WATI 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/72352"}, "Penulis": "EVITA RATNA WATI (NIM : 23607024)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing 1 : Dr. Ir.
