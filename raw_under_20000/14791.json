{"Nomor": 14791, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT OF THREE-DIMENSIONAL VORTEX ELEMENT METHOD FOR HIGH-RESOLUTION FLOW SIMULATION", "Abstrak": "Vortex Element Methods are known in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) as accurate and efficient tools for incompressible fluid flow simulation. Instead of   \n \n \n\ncalculating primitive variables, which are velocity and pressure, the methods calculate the vorticity in the flow. Therefore, the computation can be done only in regions where vorticity exists, such as in boundary layer and wake region. Besides, the methods employ Lagrangian concept by using particles in the implementation. The combination of resolving vorticity and employing Lagrangian particle method are very useful in resolving complex flow phenomena.   \n \n \n\nIn the implementation, Vortex Element Methods deal with N-body problem in the computations. As the result, Vortex Element Methods needs powerful computing resource. In order to overcome the problem, the computation of velocity and   \n \n \n\nvortex stretching in Vortex Elements Methods is usually accelerated using Fast Multipole Method (FMM). The implementation of FMM in this thesis gives capability to do high-resolution simulations using a personal computer.   \n \n \n\nThe development of three-dimensional Vortex Element Method in this thesis incorporates the development the two-dimensional and three-dimensional Vortex Element Methods in both unbounded and bounded domain. For two-dimensional   \n \n \n\ncase, simulations of Lamb-Oseen Vortex and impulsively started cylinder show good results compared with several references. In three-dimensions, interactions of vortex rings are simulated and show good results in handling complex vortex interactions.", "Daftar File": {"2009 TS PP ALEX JOHN SEPNOV 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/67609", "2009 TS PP ALEX JOHN SEPNOV 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/67610", "2009 TS PP ALEX JOHN SEPNOV 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/67611", "2009 TS PP ALEX JOHN SEPNOV 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/67612", "2009 TS PP ALEX JOHN SEPNOV 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/67613", "2009 TS PP ALEX JOHN SEPNOV 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/67614", "2009 TS PP ALEX JOHN SEPNOV 1-BAB 6.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/67615", "2009 TS PP ALEX JOHN SEPNOV 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/67616"}, "Penulis": "ALEX JOHN SEPNOV (NIM : 23606003)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Lavi R.
