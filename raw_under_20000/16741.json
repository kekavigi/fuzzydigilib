{"Nomor": 16741, "Judul": "SMART HOME SECURITY SYSTEM BASED ON ATMEGA MICONTROLLER", "Abstrak": "Nowadays home security systems utilize highly sophisticated technology, and employ innovative techniques to  \n \n\nunderstand the psychology of burglars and criminals. Though these home security systems may not be  \n \n\ncompletely foolproof, they at least help reduce the risk of crime and burglary significantly. Smart Home Security  \n \n\nSystem is Home security control based on Microcontroller (\u03bcC) board. Some security control has been  \n \n\nprogrammed in \u03bcC board and connected and controlled by PC. Devices may be connected through a computer  \n \n\nnetwork to allow control by a personal computer, and may allow remote access from the internet. The securities  \n \n\ninvolved are Door Security and Room Security. The door security are Locking/unlocking door and protection of  \n \n\nunknown people come in. It protects by Face Recognition Door Access System, Knock Recognition Door  \n \n\nAccess System, Combination Number Recognition that used in locking and unlocking door, and laser tripwire.  \n \n\nThe security involved in Room Security is Gas/smoke detection, Temperature control, Motion detection, and  \n \n\nvideo captured. Each notification of the security will be send to owner by Mobile\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s Message. The owner allows  \n \n\ncontrolled by remote Access from internet to Application Management Control in PC server.", "Daftar File": {"proceedings knsi 2013(296).pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/79401"}, "Penulis": "Nur Hadisukmana, Muammar Khadafi", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["#CONTRIBUTOR#"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Home Security, Atmega Microcontroller", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "23 Apr 2014"}
