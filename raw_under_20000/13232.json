{"Nomor": 13232, "Judul": "BASIN STUDY BASED ON GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS DATA IN THE SANGATTA BUNGALUN AREA, KUTAI BASIN", "Abstrak": "Although Kalimantan has been explored since 1920's but in the Kalimantan, especially in the Sangatta Bungalun area, there are a lot of new hydrocarbon exploration opportunity and a lot of data such as gravity, seismic survey and wells had been developed but Kalimantan is a complex area so further integrated basin study need to be done to recognize another petroleum system play plays in particular concerning risk by its tectonic complexity.Through integrated analysis of well, seismic, surface geology map, and gravity data, the basin geohistory of the Sangatta Bungalun area can be recognized. Well correlation is done to see the lithostratigraphy contrast related to its depositional environment in vertical succession. The lateral distribution of formations interpretation did from 2D seismic line helped and validated with well and the surface geology map. The basin delineation and regional basement identification did from the gravity analysis and forward modeling.Gravity analysis which very useful in the deep section which cannot reach by seismic can helped the basement interpretation constrained with the well, geology map, and seismic data in the surface and in shallow subsurface structure, the detail interpretation of the structure and the typical seismic facies can be recognize also with the seismic analysis and the well data and surface data (geology map). Basin geohistory using subsidence analysis constrained with the seismic data can identified the history of the area. Tectonostratigraphy is also built through the geohistory analysis and proved by the seismic analysis.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ALEXIS BADAI SAMUDRA (NIM: 22308315)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. Ir.
