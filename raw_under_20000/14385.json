{"Nomor": 14385, "Judul": "THE APPLICATION OF ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK TO PREDICT FRACTURE CONDUCTIVITY OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING", "Abstrak": "Artificial neural network, introduced in this paper, assist engineer in predicting fracture conductivity. Unlike conventional simulators that are based on mathematical modeling of the fracturing process, the process introduced in this paper uses no specific mathematical model. As a result, access to explicit reservoir data, such as porosity, permeability, thickness, and stress profile, is not essential. Basic well information, such as fracture dimensions, permeability, porosity, modulus young, poison ration, propant type, propant pumped, is readily available. Most of these data, however, are not considered to be useful engineering data for hydraulic fracturing treatment design. However, many of these variables may contribute to the overall success or failure of a hydraulic fracture treatment in some indirect or complex way. Methodology presented in this paper is capable of predicting fracture conductivity on the basis of historical data in Kaji Semoga and South Balam Field, Telisa formation in South Sumatera, without detailed reservoir data. This is a major advantage over conventional hydraulic fracturing simulators, which can translate to considerable savings because it eliminates the need for expensive data collection. With this methodology, fracture conductivity was predicted with approximately 7% error.", "Daftar File": {"2011 TA PP PRABUHARNOGO 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/65197"}, "Penulis": "PRABUHARNOGO (NIM 12206040)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. Ir.
