HM SAMPOERNA TBK", "Abstrak": "A firm has to involve all its employees in its journey to be a successful company. Suggestion system is one of the oldest methods of employee involvement which has been applied in many big companies today.Sampoerna had launched a suggestion system in 1998 but it did not fly high and went to downward direction in 2002. However the Sampoerna      \n \n \n \n\nsuggestion system was revamped in 2004 and re-implemented only in Pandaan Plant. But until present day, number of suggestions received in Pandaan Plant is not as much as expected. I was given the project to design a sustainable suggestion system to be implemented in Karawang Plant. If      \n \n \n \n\nthe implementation in Karawang Plant successful, the suggestion system is also expected to be implemented in other Sampoerna factories or other functions like sales or marketing. The methodology I used in this final project is a qualitative study. Qualitative study is commonly used especially when the topic needs to be explored and variables are not easy to be identified, as I faced in this final project. Kinds of qualitative study are literature search, interviews and benchmarks. There are three parties involved in the interviews: employees,      \n \n \n \n\nmanagers and third parties. The meaning of third party here is the practitioner of suggestion system in benchmark companies. Employees and managers mentioned earlier are from internal company PT HM Sampoerna Tbk. After completing the study, I designed the framework of sustainable suggestion system and a new model of suggestion system for Karawang Plant. The new model includes idea-form and scoring guideline that are different with previous Sampoerna suggestion system.      \n \n \n \n\nTo sustain a suggestion system, it requires fulfillment of the six parameters i.e. motivated employees, committed management and supportive organization, easy access to the system, two-way communication between suggester and his supervisor, burden of proof is in the suggester, and      \n \n \n \n\nreward & recognition. The one missing from previous Sampoerna suggestion scheme is reward system. Karawang\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s new suggestion system has transparent evaluation criteria and reward. Reward and recognition is designed to match Sampoerna culture, for example Above and Beyond Call of Duty (ABCD) award. In this suggestion scheme, employee is encouraged to create idea based on continuous improvement spirit (kaizen). Do not wait for big ideas to make a suggestion but always start any ideas how small it is. According to concept of idea pyramid, excellent idea will be obtained after hundred or thousand simple ideas are yielded. There are three main sources of making simple ideas i.e. muda, mura, muri (Japanese words for waste, irregularity and difficulty) For the beginning step in implementing suggestion system, management should focus on quantity of idea, not the quality of idea. Main focus is on simple ideas instead of grand ideas. Management should make promotion for suggestion system regularly to encourage whole participation from the target employees. If more than fifty percent of total employees have participated in giving ideas, then focus of suggestion system could be shifted on quality of idea.", "Daftar File": {"2009 TS PP GUSTIAWAN GODI 1- COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/91232", "2009 TS PP GUSTIAWAN GODI 1- BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/91233", "2009 TS PP GUSTIAWAN GODI 1- BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/91234", "2009 TS PP GUSTIAWAN GODI 1- BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/91235", "2009 TS PP GUSTIAWAN GODI 1- BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/91236", "2009 TS PP GUSTIAWAN GODI 1- PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/91237"}, "Penulis": "GUSTIAWAN GODI (NIM: 29107201)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Prof. Dr. Ir.
