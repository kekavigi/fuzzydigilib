In addition to the metal as a source of not renewable energies, the metal was also susceptible to rusting (corrosion). Corrosion in metals is one of the problems that lead to both material losses and environmental contamination risk. The most effective corrosion control and still being developed so far is to use organic compounds as inhibitors of corrosion on the metal. Ascorbic acid is a corrosion inhibitor on metals that are environmentally friendly. In this thesis, we conducted simulation model development and the corrosion rate of 1% NaCl (corrosive environment) of Carbon Steel by adapting the reaction model between a Competitive Inhibitor and Enzyme, use the concept in general, the reaction rate and Michaelis Menten equation. Model and simulation of corrosion rate on carbon steel using inhibitors (Ascorbic Acid) to show the effects of these inhibitors on the function of corrosion rate. Simulation of corrosion rate is used to find much corroded products for long-term time is obtained through numerical solutions.", "Daftar File": {"2010 TA PP HENDRA GUNAWAN 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/74240", "2010 TA PP HENDRA GUNAWAN 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/74241", "2010 TA PP HENDRA GUNAWAN 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/74242", "2010 TA PP HENDRA GUNAWAN 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/74243", "2010 TA PP HENDRA GUNAWAN 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/74244", "2010 TA PP HENDRA GUNAWAN 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/74245", "2010 TA PP HENDRA GUNAWAN 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/74246"}, "Penulis": "HENDRA GUNAWAN  (NIM : 10106097)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dosen Pembimbing : Dr. Nuning Nuraini M.Si"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Corrosion; Corrosion Inhibitor; Competitive Inhibitor; Ascorbic Acid; Carbon Steel.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
