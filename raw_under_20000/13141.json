{"Nomor": 13141, "Judul": "ELECTRON TUNNELING THROUGH TRAPEZOIDAL POTENTIAL BARRIER IN NONPARABOLIC CONDITION", "Abstrak": "A nonparabolic condition in an energy dispersion of electron happens due to an interaction of the conduction band with other bands. A theory concerning this effect was first developed by Kane (1957) by using the k.p method which results in Kane's dispersion law. Later, Kane's approach is used in many cases of nonparabolicity problems. Along with that, the nonparabolic effect is also one serious problem in metaloxide-semiconductor (MOS) research in which tunneling is a common case. It is because, in reality, there is no semiconductor that has energy dispersion in a simple parabolic form. Calculation in a parabolic condition is evaluated as a first approach to get results due to its simplicity. However, involving the nonparabolicity in calculation becomes one alternative development in expectation to get better results.In this paper we use Kane's relation to consider the nonparabolicity in case of electron tunneling through a trapezoidal potential barrier. Here we use it from the very first step in defining the wave equation of electron in materials. From the calculation and analysis, it can be concluded that the method used in this report gives good-behaved results. The feature of involving the valence band interaction has also been directly observed in certain circumstances by the phenomenon of non-small transmittance probability for a range of energy less than the potential barrier. The phenomenon results in the effect of negative differential resistance (NDR) in the electron tunneling current pattern.", "Daftar File": {"2009 TA PP THOMAS ALFA EDISON 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/56711", "2009 TA PP THOMAS ALFA EDISON 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/56712", "2009 TA PP THOMAS ALFA EDISON 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/56713", "2009 TA PP THOMAS ALFA EDISON 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/56714", "2009 TA PP THOMAS ALFA EDISON 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/56715", "2009 TA PP THOMAS ALFA EDISON 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/56716", "2009 TA PP THOMAS ALFA EDISON 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/56717"}, "Penulis": "THOMAS ALFA EDISON (NIM 10205032)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. Eng.
