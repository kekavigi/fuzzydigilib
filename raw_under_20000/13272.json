{"Nomor": 13272, "Judul": "ACOUSTIC IMPEDANCE INVERSION OF CARBONATE ROCK BATU RAJA FORMATION IN PAGARDEWA AREA SOUTH SUMATRA", "Abstrak": "Pagardewa Area is located in South Sumatra Basin, Indonesia. All petroleum system components are proven in this area, however not all of the exploration wells discovered hydrocarbon. Dry hole report mentioned that the main problem which caused dry well is the of porosity distribution of the carbonate reservoir (Batu Raja Formation). The objective of this project is to apply acoustic impedance (AI) to this data to derive porosity distribution.In this area, there are seven exploration wells data and migrated stack seismic 3D volume. From the well data, the AI and porosity has a correlation therefore the AI can be used to predict the porosity. The research includes the seismic to well tie, feasibility analysis, initial model building, AI inversion, predict the porosity distribution and interpret the diagenetic process. Five inversion methods generate similar trend of AI section, however the model based method gives the best AI result. Base on this result, predicted porosity can be mapped to estimate the porous carbonate rock distribution.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ANTON DARMAWAN (NIM 22308321)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. Fatkhan dan Rusalida Raguwanti, M.Sc."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Geofisaka Terapan", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Pagardewa Area, accoustic impedance, porosity", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Vika Anastasya Kovariansi \u00a0\n                                     Vika Anastasya Kovariansi", "File": "8 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Feb 2012"}
