{"Nomor": 10411, "Judul": "THE ANALYSIS TO THE INFLUENCE OF CORRODENTS TYPE AND CONCENTRATION, INHIBITOR CONTENT AND TEMPERATURE TO THE CORROSION ATTACK AISI 304L", "Abstrak": "AISI 304L is a stainless steel which commonly used at industry and marine environment. One of corrosion controlling method that applied to AISI 304L for temperatures range 100-200 oC in those environment is adding Sodium Silicate (NaSiO3) to the thermal insulation used.This research was done to learn the influence of corrodents type and concentration, inhibitor content and temperature to the corrosion attack AISI 304L. Both corrodents type commonly present at industry and marine environment are NaCl dan Na2SO4. To accomplish those purposes, the corrosion rate and inhibitor efficiency measurement were done. The corrosion rate measurement was resulted by Tafel extrapolation from Cyclic Polarization Test. The change of metal surface appearance were examined using stereo microscope. While corrosion products were identified by visual examination.The results of this research provide that thermal insulation containing NaSiO3 is not effective to prevent Chloride attacks to the AISI 304L. This low efficiency tends to accelerate localized corrosion. In addition, the increasing of temperature provide corrosion rate acceleration.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "FARIH MITRANINGSIH (NIM 13704031)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Prof. Dr. Ir.
