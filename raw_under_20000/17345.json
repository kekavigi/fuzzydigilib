The results of learning process \n\nevaluation of OOP at the end of the even semester 2009-2010 showed that the percentage of students who did \n\nnot pass in this course is still high, about 40%. Some of the causes identified were learning motivation and \n\nlearning participation outside the class are still low, the motivation to often learn practice programming are \n\nlow, difficulty to imagine how a program running and to understand the change value of the variables, the \n\nstudents did not know the relationship between teaching materials with real life clearly, and distribution of \n\nstudents' understanding was unfair. A number of innovations had been implemented in the odd semester \n\n2010/2011 to improve the quality of the learning process. The innovation can be grouped into five categories, \n\nnamely the curriculum development and course content organization, delivery methods and techniques, \n\ninnovative learning media to support self-learning, classroom management, and learning assessment. The \n\nresults of evaluation at the end of odd semester 2010-2011 showed an increase in GPA average, from 1879 to \n\n1.9896 and the percentage of pass students from 60.16% to 62.5%. Based on the satisfaction questionnaire, it is \n\nknown that the level of satisfaction of students were above 3.5 of 5. So it can be concluded that the innovation \n\ncan improve the quality of the learning process. But, as educators, we must always try to make improvements.", "Daftar File": {"proceedings knsi 2014 full edition(343).pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/82948"}, "Penulis": "Susana Limanto", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["#CONTRIBUTOR#"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "object oriented programming, learning innovation", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Mar 2014"}
