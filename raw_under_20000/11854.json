{"Nomor": 11854, "Judul": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF 4 CHANNEL MICROCONTROLLER BASED ELECTROMYOGRAPH", "Abstrak": "Muscles generate electrical pulses during contraction. These electric pulses called action potentials. The frequency of these pulses correlated with the tension force developed at the muscle. Device used to detect and record muscle electric pulses or signals is the electromyograph or EMG. EMG uses electrodes to sense the signal from muscle during contraction. EMG signals can be used in many applications, whether it has been recorded or displayed/analyzed in real time. In the medical application, recorded EMG signals are used to diagnose many muscle related diseases or disorders such as neuromuscular disease that affect muscle and/or their nerve control, muscle motor problem that cause involuntary twitches at voluntary muscles, muscle atrophy, gait analysis, and many more. EMG also can be used during therapy and rehabilitation as one of the monitored parameter. EMG signals also used to enable physical trainer to monitor athletes training result. Another example of EMG application is to monitor muscle fatigue during ergonomic studies. Some of the examples of injuries because of the muscle fatigue are the low back injuries and carpal tunnel syndrome.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ARGA ARIDARMA (NIM 23206009)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. Ir.
