To develop and launch a series of successful new products, PT Otto appointed Business Development Division to be in charge of the task. Using Cooper's The Innovation Diamond strategy elements to evaluate PT Otto\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s new product development process, it is found that Business Development Division doesn\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019t implement an effective, efficient and streamline idea\u2010to\u2010launch process of new product development.     \n \n \n \n\nThis research discusses the new product development process that is currently implemented at PT Otto and the implementation of idea\u2010to\u2010launch process using Stage\u2010Gate model by Robert G. Cooper for product development in pharmaceutical company. From this observation it is found that the idea\u2010to\u2010launch process in PT Otto is executed without a standard operating procedures and a sufficient knowledge, especially in the fuzzy front\u2010end stages.     \n \n \n \n\nTo overcome these problems, the Stage\u2010Gate model can be applied with the addition of one gate and one stage, that is a decision for and product registration at Badan POM. Stage\u2010Gate model is also applied to the development of Opinacea gummy until the stage of prototyping without any significant difficulty. There is also a need to improve the knowledge of Business Development division members. The knowledge needed are NPD procedures and other supporting knowledge such as marketing, operations, finance, medical and pharmaceutical. Stage\u2010Gate model can be used as a reference for standard operating procedures of new product development at PT Otto. The implementation of Stage\u2010Gate Model needs also to be applied to the process of developing other types of products such as medicines and traditional medicines before standardizes it. For simpler products, NexGen Stage\u2010Gate Model can be used, that is the Lite Stage\u2010Gate and Stage\u2010Gate Xpress type.", "Daftar File": {"2011 TS PP YUMITA YUDHALAKSANA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/99895", "2011 TS PP YUMITA YUDHALAKSANA 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/99894", "2011 TS PP YUMITA YUDHALAKSANA 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/99893", "2011 TS PP YUMITA YUDHALAKSANA 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/99892", "2011 TS PP YUMITA YUDHALAKSANA 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/99891", "2011 TS PP YUMITA YUDHALAKSANA 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/99890"}, "Penulis": "YUMITA YUDHALAKSANA (NIM: 29108312)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Reza A.
