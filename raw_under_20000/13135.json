The study takes one of the forerunners of professional football (soccer) club as the object. Persib (Persatuan Sepakbola Indonesia Bandung), a football club which resides in Bandung. Persib has proven to be one of the most prominent football clubs in terms of business, fans, and professionalism. Each home game are watched by a minimum number of 40,000 spectators, and the company itself, PT. PBB (Persib Bandung Bermartabat, Inc.) has managed to generate a yearly income of approx. 12 Billion Rupiahs, income which is considered as the largest from a professional football club in Indonesia. The study is aimed to discover how the construct of BETS (Brand Equity of Team Sports) would influence the Sponsorship Outcome. Questionnaires were distributed to 403 fans of Persib Bandung, whom are ssociated with Viking community. The study modifies the concept of Bauer, et al. (2005) that applies the concept of Consumer Based Brand Equity from Keller (1993), and also the concept of Sponsorship Outcome (SO) from Gwinner and Swanson (2003). BETS is divided into four dimension; Awareness, Product-Related Attributes, Non Product-Related Attributes, and Brand Benefits. For the football context, each dimension is measured according to the characteristics of a football club. Product-related attributes consists of Athletic success, star player(s), coach, and management. Sponsorship Outcome is measured by; Sponsor recognition, attitude toward sponsor, sponsor patronage, and satisfaction with sponsor. The research would focus on observing SO on the context of general sponsorship of Persib, Honda, and PT. Daya Adira Mustika. The concepts are modified by researcher to fit research context. \n\n20 items has been developed for measurement, and was verified for validity and reliability using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA). Items that pass the EFA were used as research tools where Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) analysis will be applied as statistical means of analysis. After factor analysis, 15 items from the independent variable was grouped into two factors; 7 belonging to Image and 5 belonging to Personal Attachments. As for the dependent variable, 5 items were grouped into one factor. A single dependent variable was \n\n2 \n\nobserved using qualitative technique, anlayzed with descriptive analysis, variable that attempts to describe awareness concept. Empirical test prove research hypothesis that BETS significantly affect SO using SEM, and dimensions of BETS correlates with SO. Simpler dimensions of BETS proposed by this study can accurately measure BETS, and the research also concluded Honda as the top of mind sponsor of Persib.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SYAUQY LUKMAN  ( NIM: 29007015 )", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Reza Ashari Nasution"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Sponsorship, Sports Marketing, Brand Equity, Structural Equation Modelling", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "8 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Des 2011"}
