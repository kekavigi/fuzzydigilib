{"Nomor": 13237, "Judul": "ROCK PROPERTIES DISTRIBUTION OF LIMESTONE RESERVOIR IN UPPER CIBULAKAN FORMATION AT TOPAZ FIELD, INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "Rock properties are important parameters for analysis of a rock. These are including: porosity, permeability, and saturation water. These parameters are only obtained through the well which reflects the parameter at one point. Meanwhile, laterally property mapping is needed in order to understand the property distribution. Geostatistics method is used to map the lateral property using parameters derived from well data using the spatial distribution of seismic attributes. The rock properties are obtained through petrophysical evaluation using available logs data (Gamma Ray, density, neutron porosity, etc). Meanwhile, analysis of seismic attributes is taken into account to understand the distribution of reservoir porosity. We use the existing approach to use trends in 3D seismic data, in the form of seismic attributes, to interpolate sparsely sampled well-log measurements between well locations, as the form of cokriging method.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ALLAN MORIS (NIM: 22308303)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. Darharta Dahrin dan Ricky A.
