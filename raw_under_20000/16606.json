{"Nomor": 16606, "Judul": "ANALYZING BUSINESS FEASIBILITY STUDY AT GAS STATION FOR PT. TOTAL OIL INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "The number of vehicles in Indonesia significantly increases each year, but this is not followed by oil supply as fuel, which becomes less in supply. The world\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s oil price that increases each year worsens the condition. Oil fuel (premium) has been continuously a problem in Indonesia, which still hold the subsidy system. To overcome the problem, the government replan conversing BBM to BBG program as one of other solutions to decrease subsidy gradually. PT. Total Oil Indonesia as one of oil and gas companies in Indonesia sees the problem as an opportunity to build SPBG to support the government\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s program. Based on the situation, this project will discuss business feasibility analysis in SPBG of PT. Total Oil Indonesia. To analyze business feasibility, business situation analysis was done by using Feasibility Study and Sensitivity Analysis. The primary indicator used to determined the feasibility was NPV (Net Present Value), IRR(Internal Rate of Return) and PBP (Payback Period). The formulated feasibility analysis would be the basic implementation plan for PT Total Oil Indonesia. The result of analysis of information gathered showed that SPBG development project would be optimal and feasible to be started if BBM subsidy was removed, so that the gas price would be 40% cheaper than premium price, the availability of equal gas-buying price as raw material, and also the implementation of government\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s plan to give free converter kit to the society. To solve the main problem in subsidized fuel in Indonesia, the government is supposed to do the conversion from fuel petrol subsidy to fuel gas. To get it well implemented TOI will take a part in cooperating with the government program to develop step in constructing gas station with 4 scenarios already explored before that is firstly applied to the public transportation and then to all of Indonesian people. The steps are installing the Hybrid Station to see how the market works and then going to the next step is to construct pipeline station system and further more (for stable condition) the last step is to build a Mother \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2013 Daughter Station package. The implementation done in a working program will be held for short-term (5 years) as pilot project evaluation and long-term (15 years).", "Daftar File": {"2012 TS PP MUHAMMAD YAZID 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/78609", "2012 TS PP MUHAMMAD YAZID 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/78610", "2012 TS PP MUHAMMAD YAZID 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/78611", "2012 TS PP MUHAMMAD YAZID 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/78612", "2012 TS PP MUHAMMAD YAZID 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/78613", "2012 TS PP MUHAMMAD YAZID 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/78614"}, "Penulis": "MUHAMMAD YAZID (NIM 29109305)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Erman Sumirat, SE, MBuss"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Administrasi Bisnis", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "BBM Subsidy, Conversion from BBM into BBG, Feasibility Analysis, Gas Refueling Station (SPBG)", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Dwina Fatimiyah Shidiq \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "6 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
