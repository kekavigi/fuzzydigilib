Situation of government project is always uncertain and the company as the consortium leader shall face new challenges in the next RFID tender if there will be one to be announced. CEO of PT. Sejahtera must evaluate the partnership and the project so that the company knows what to do next, evaluate the situation, select a course of action and analyses what lies ahead. Observation findings lead to analysis that the previous RFID project done PT. Sejahtera and the SSE consortium partnership was completed in a rush fashion. This is a situation where bound rationality happened and produced a not optimal Solution because of limited information, bias decision making and did not have ingredient of a winning team mentality. Also, consortium did not have an agreement, planning and evaluation system which can evaluate organizational performance so that they can maintain organizational harmony. In the other hand, company vision and mission requires PT. Sejahtera Company to have a world class standard of process of activities such as CMMI and decision making which have best practice of doing activities in a sufficiently time bound manner. From this point of view of analysis, it require KT rational process that are able to produce a systematic mapping of PT.

Furthermore, the company should replace the previous partnership and create a new partnership with a fresh start of rational selection. Selecting a project shall be inseparable with selecting with the right partnership.

The KT process not only revising company strategy in practical level, but the process has to be implemented further. Hence, one of recommendations in this final year project is to have PT. Sejahtera integrate KT framework to their business process and to form rational management. Another recommendation is that implementing other decision making tools such as interactive decision making and collective decision making for purpose of deciding important matters in a partnership. In evaluating Indonesia\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s market and government projects, it shall be also wise to explore zero sum games because of the nature of its competition, assuming that PT. Sejahtera cannot always create and do blue ocean strategy. Also, the company must learn and explore application of heuristics.
