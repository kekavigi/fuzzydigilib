{"Nomor": 17882, "Judul": "INVESTMENT ANALYSIS OF NEW INPATIENT WARDS PROJECT AT ULIN HOSPITAL OF BANJARMASIN", "Abstrak": "Adequate health care in a province is one of the primary needs that cannot be neglected. These needs will affect the health and life expectancy of the population of the province. Without the availability of adequate health facilities, communities will be increasingly difficult to gain access to adequate health care. The hospital is one of the health facilities provided by the government or private, in which there are many types of health services one of which is the inpatient ward.      \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe research for this thesis conducted at new inpatient wards project of BLUD Ulin hospital in Banjarmasin. At this time, RS Ulin has ten class inpatient services with a total capacity of 520 beds. Class of service is divided into VVIP-A, VVIP-B, VVIP-C, VVIP-D, VIP-A,VIP-B, VIP-C, Class 1, Class 2, and Class 3. The main focus of this thesis is to conduct an investment analysis on new inpatient wards class VVIP-A, VVIP-D, VIP-B, VIPC, Class 1, and Class 2, which claimed a total investment cost of Rp. 39,781,562,180. Investment valuation method used is Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and payback period (PBP).      \n \n \n \n \n \n\nAlternative funding of this project is fully funding through APBD or the debt with a portion of the loan 60% of the total cost of the investment. From the analysis it was found under the mostly-like conditions with optimal occupancy rate 70% that the value of the project by fully APBD funding alternative budget has a greater NPV and IRR and PBP faster the NPV is Rp 28,496,595,592; IRR 14.67%; simple PBP 7 years 5 months; discounted PBP 10 years 5 months while that for second alternative funding the NPV is Rp (1,504,304,542); IRR of 9.15%      \n \n \n \n \n \n\nBy using the fully APBD funding alternative budget, then conduct scenario analysis with variations in bed occupancy rate. The condition is divided into four additional scenarios are very pessimistic, pessimistic, optimistic, and very optimistic with their respective optimal occupancy rate 56%, 63%, 77%, and 84%. From the results obtained in scenario analysis very pessimistic scenario project has NPV Rp 10,899,289,212; IRR 11.06%; simple PBP 8 years 2 months; PBP discounted 12 years 7 months", "Daftar File": {"2013 TS PP ALDILLA WIRA NUGRAHA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/86263", "2013 TS PP ALDILLA WIRA NUGRAHA 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/86264", "2013 TS PP ALDILLA WIRA NUGRAHA 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/86265", "2013 TS PP ALDILLA WIRA NUGRAHA 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/86266", "2013 TS PP ALDILLA WIRA NUGRAHA 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/86267", "2013 TS PP ALDILLA WIRA NUGRAHA 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/86268"}, "Penulis": "ALDILLA WIRA NUGRAHA (NIM: 29109348)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["#CONTRIBUTOR#"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Administrasi Bisnis", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Hospitals, inpatient, BOR, NPV, IRR, PBP", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "6 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
