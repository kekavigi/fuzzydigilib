{"Nomor": 17390, "Judul": "DESAIN IN SILICO INHIBITOR HEPATOCYTE GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR BERBASIS SENYAWA ALAM INDONESIA DARI TUMBUHAN DIPTEROCARPACEAE", "Abstrak": "Hepatocyte Growth Factor Receptor (HGFR) is a transmembrane protein that have function as signal transducer. Autophosphorylation at HGFR\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s tyrosin kinase domain activates signal transducing causing cancer metastasis. The aim of this research is using in silico approach to design new inhibitor HGFR\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s tyrosin kinase from Indonesia\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s natural compound found in Dipterocarpaceae plants. HGFR binding energy of nine compounds (log P < 5) from 32 Indonesia\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s natural compound is prodicted using molecular docking software, AutoDock Vina. The result shows that Diptoindonesin G (DIG) is compound with lowest binding energy (-11.0 kcal/mol). New compound (DG2) is designed by replacement of one DIG\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s hidroxyl group with methyl group. DG2\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s binding energy is -11.5 kcal/mol as shown by molecular docking result. Molecular dynamic simulation (2 ns) of DIG-HGFR and DG2-HGFR complexes shows binding energy change of both compounds. Weaker DIG binding energy of -8,76 kcal/mol is observed. In the other hand, stronger DG2 binding energy of -11,99 kcal/mol is observed. Ligand-receptor interaction analysis after 2 ns shows that HGFR-DG2 complex assumes inactive conformation as observed at HGFR-ARQ197 complex. Interaction beetwen DG2/ARQ197 with Arg1227 is critical in stabilization of inactive conformation. However, DG2 and ARQ197 has different mode of interaction. ARQ197 interact with Arg1227 hydrophobicly, whereas DG2 forms hydrogen bonding with Arg1227. From similiarity of HGFR inactive conformation standpoint, DG2 is predicted to has similar inhibition characteristic and mechanism with ARQ197.", "Daftar File": {"2012 TA PP TEGAR NURWAHYU WIJAYA 1- PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/83207"}, "Penulis": "TEGAR NURWAHYU WIJAYA (NIM : 10508036)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing 1 : Dr. Rukman Hertadi        \n \n \n \n \n \n\nPembimbing 2  :Prof. Dr. Yana Maolana Syah"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "simulasi dinamika molekul, HGFR, molecular docking, energi ikat", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
