{"Nomor": 13519, "Judul": "STUDY OF ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE PROPAGATION IN 2D PHOTONIC CRYSTAL WITH DEFECT USING GREEN'S-TENSOR METHOD", "Abstrak": "In this thesis, the electromagnetic wave propagation in a 2D photonic crystal (PC) has been investigated using the Green's tensor approach. The approach consists of formulation of the Green's tensor in two dimensional systems and applying it to the Lippman-Schwinger equation to calculate the electric field distribution of the considered system. Numerical calculations were performed on the discretized Lippman-Schwinger equation. The result scheme was then benchmarked with the analytical result of the single dielectric rod. Investigation on the existence of transverse magnetic (TM) wave bandgap as well as waveguide phenomena was performed. The field power profile was also obtained for a point defect that is located above a waveguide.  The results show that the numerical calculation agrees with the analytical version with a field amplitude error of less than 1%. 2D PC waveguide has also been confirmed for an incoming TM wave by taking its bandgap frequency. For point defect above the waveguide, coupling and electromagnetic wave accumulation were investigated inside the defect. Furthermore changing the frequency of the incident wave will produce gradual changes in the defect electric field power.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "HENDRADI HARDHIENATA (NIM: 20206007)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. Alexander A.
