{"Nomor": 11633, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT OF A FULL MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF WiSE 8 CRAFT FOR FLIGHT SIMULATOR IMPLEMENTATION", "Abstrak": "The Wing-Ship or Wing in Surface Effect (WiSE) craft is an air vehicle flying near the surface to obtain a surface effect in order to gain an improved aerodynamic lift-drag ratio. The effect appears at an altitude of wing chord or less from the surface.Due to potential market in Indonesia, the Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) and Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) have started to design and develop the Wing in Surface Effect craft to fulfill the transportation system among the small islands in Indonesia. The first project was to develop the Radio Controlled model of WiSE craft for 10-20 passengers. The prototype of the Radio Controlled model has been built and successfully flight-tested. Based on the experiences obtained from the development of the Radio Controlled model, the second project was launched. The project was aimed to build the technology demonstrator of Wing in Surface Effect craft of eight-seater configuration (WISE 8 Craft).The WiSE 8 Craft is different from other aircraft, since it will fly near the surface. To introduce the handling quality to the future pilots, it is mandatory to develop a flight simulator. A full mathematical model is then required to drive the flight simulator. The development of the full mathematical model of WiSE 8 Craft for flight simulator implementation is the subject of this thesis. The full mathematical model should be able to describe the WiSE 8 Craft in its whole flight envelope, entire maneuvers and missions, all pilot inputs, and all configuration changes. Furthermore, to be able to drive a flight simulator, the mathematical model is also required to be online and real time.The full mathematical model of WiSE 8 Craft consists of the model of aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, propulsion, flight control system, and the mass and inertia. Each of the models has its own database that described their variables at various flight conditions and configurations. MATLAB/Simulink software is used to represent the model in a PC. To demonstrate the implementation of the mathematical model of WiSE 8 Craft, the simulation results are visualized in a PC-based flight simulator, X-Plane.The model shows good result performing various maneuvers in the whole flight envelope. All designed inputs and configurations could also be modeled. The model shows results that are in a good agreement with the performance parameters stated in the DRO. The model also shows a good result in demonstrating the visualization in the X-Plane. The real-time requirement, however, could not be achieved due to the hardware limitations.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "YAZDI IBRAHIM JENIE (NIM 23606012)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. Hari Muhammad"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Dirgantara", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "wing in surface effect, ground effect, flight simulator, mathematical model, aerodynamics model, hydrodynamics model, propulsion model, flight control system model, mass and inertia model", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Vika Anastasya Kovariansi \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "9 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Okt 2017"}
