{"Nomor": 13368, "Judul": "REDESIGNING BALANCED SCORECARD FOR HOTEL X", "Abstrak": "The research is aimed to redesign the BSC that already built since 2008 for Hotel X which is no longer implemented, in order to improve the hotel performance, especially in under-construction condition where Hotel X wants to upgrade the level to five-star-hotel. Several conceptual issues that were paid special attention in this research are determining strategy to objective, determining KPI, determining strategy initiative, and determining weight of all perspective, objective, and KPI in BSC. In designing and implementing BSC, the company needs to involve every element in the company because the BSC project needs support from all division and level consider the BSC not only as the measurement tool in the company but also as the strategy management tool.The analysis is done by several steps which are make comparison and gap analysis between former BSC result and former BSC plan, gaps analysis between former BSC plan and company strategy 2008-2012, root causes linkage of gap analysis 1 and gap analysis 2, adjusted company strategy 2010-2014 with linkage result, strategy mapping from adjusted company strategy 2010-2014 with linkage result, and weighting BSC using AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) method. AHP method is method used to organize information and judgment in choosing the alternative that are most preferred (Saaty, 1993). AHP weighting in this analysis covers perspective, objective, and KPI of the company. Weighting is done to ease company calculate their performance qualitatively.The results from this research are the new BSC for Hotel X that suitable with company strategy 2010-2014. Based on weighting analysis, learning & growth perspective has the highest impact to achieve Hotel X goal in 2010 because it has the highest weight from the other perspective in BSC. Hence, company should pay intensive attention to the related perspective in order to develop their performance. The critical issues that occur in designing former Hotel X BSC are missing in translating several strategies into action, lack in considering long term plan, and lack in communicating the BSC itself to all employees. So, Hotel X must paid more attention to those issues.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "DELLA ACHMAD FAWAZ (NIM 19007010)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Ir.
