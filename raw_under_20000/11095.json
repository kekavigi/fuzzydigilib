{"Nomor": 11095, "Judul": "PROPERTIES OF THE IMMOBILIZED CANDIDA ANTARCTICA LIPASE B ON HIGHLY MACROPOROUS COPOLYMER", "Abstrak": "In spite of their excellent catalytic properties, enzymes should be improved before their implementation both in industrial and laboratorium scale. Immobilization of enzyme is one of the way that purposed in their properties improvement, such as their activity, stability, and reusability. Candida antarctica lipase B (Cal-B) has been shown a great number in numerous publications to be a particularly useful enzyme catalizing in many type of reaction including regio- and enantio- synthesis. For this case, cross-linking of immobilized Cal-B with 1,2,7,8 diepoxy octane is one of methods that proved significantly more stable from denaturation by heat, organic solvents, and proteolysis than lyophilized powder or soluble enzymes. More over, the aim of this procedure is improvement of enzymes activity and reusability. Enzyme kinetics test of immobilized enzymes folows the Michaelis-Menten models, and their activity is match with previous experiment. According Vmax values of immobilized enzymes and free enzyme indicated that immobilized enzymes show higher activity than free enzyme. The cross-linking of immobilized enzyme gives the result that for lower cross-linker concentration, FIC (Full immobilization Crystals)  gives the highest activity and for higher cross-linker concentration, PIC (Part Immobilization Crystals) gives the highest activity. However, pore size and saturation level give an influence of their activity.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "NURRAHMI HANDAYANI (NIM 20507026)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Nemanja Miletic, M.Sc., Dr. Sadijah Achmad, DEA., dan Dr. Katja U.
