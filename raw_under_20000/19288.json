All human activities need energies, either the ones coming from renewable resources or not. In addition, we cannot deny admitting that non-renewable energies such as oil and gas are the backbones of the world\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s economy since they are the most commonly-consumed types used by industries, transportation modes, and other sectors of human life. As the consequence, exploration and production activities of oil and gas become an important issue as well.  \n \n\nA proper facility is absolutely required to fulfill the need of oil and gas explorations and productions. The facility has to be able to help human to do these activities under all of the circumstances such as dead loads, live loads, and environmental loads that may exist under operational and extreme conditions. Since oil and gas reservoirs are often found at sea, offshore platforms, become the most required facility to accommodate people in finding and producing oils and gases. Those platforms mostly designed to deliver the operator\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s needs along the service life period.  \n \n\nAs the consequence, another problem comes up. There must be some things to do after the platforms reach their operating period. Specifically in Indonesia, about 70 platforms have reached their service life periods until 2004. Further problems may occur if there is nothing done with these inactive platforms. They may be platform-ship collisions, reservoir spilling, explosions due to extreme pressure from the oil and gas to the rig, and many others. These problems surely have to be prevented by doing platform decommissioning.  \n \n\nAnother challenge for Indonesia is that there is a limited number of study discussing this topic in terms of how will it be in Indonesia. Thus, studies covering some aspects of oil and gas platforms decommissioning such as the options, methods, legal aspects, cost components, and stakeholders are needed.", "Daftar File": {"2011 TA PP REZA MAULANA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/96507", "2011 TA PP REZA MAULANA 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/96508", "2011 TA PP REZA MAULANA 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/96509", "2011 TA PP REZA MAULANA 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/96510", "2011 TA PP REZA MAULANA 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/96511", "2011 TA PP REZA MAULANA 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/96512"}, "Penulis": "REZA MAULANA  (NIM : 15007148)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Ir.
