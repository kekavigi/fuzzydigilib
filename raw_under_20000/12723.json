{"Nomor": 12723, "Judul": "STUDY, ANALYSIS, IMPLEMENTATION AND COMPARISON BETWEEN JPEG AND JPEG2000", "Abstrak": "In this final year project, analysis towards JPEG and JPEG2000 image compression algorithms will be done and then theses two algorithms will be implemented into application. Firstly, theories of JPEG and JPEG2000 will be studied in detail. After that, analysis will be processed towards these two compression algorithms. The result of analysis will be implemented into application called CompareJJ2k. The application CompareJJ2k is developed using visual C++ programming language with Microsoft .NET framework. Open source library of JPEG and JPEG2000 will be used in implementation. After application is implemented, testing will be done to see whether CompareJJ2k application met the functional requirements defined in analysis stage. Testing will be done with the provided image which includes grey scale and color image with different size. The results will be compared in five different parameters such as file size, time to compress image, compression ratio, PSNR and MSE to see why JPEG is more popular than JPEG2000.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "THAZIN AUNGSOE (NIM 13504163)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Rinaldi Munir, M.T."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "Teknik Informatika", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Teknik Elektro dan Informatika", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "JPEG, JPEG2000, Image compression, compression, DCT, DWT, PSNR, MSE,", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Vika Anastasya Kovariansi \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Okt 2017"}
