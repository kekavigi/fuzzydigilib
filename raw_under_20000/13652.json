{"Nomor": 13652, "Judul": "FACIES INTERPRETATION OF TALANG AKAR FORMATION IN DIAMOND 3D AREA USING SEISMIC ATTRIBUTES", "Abstrak": "Talang Akar formation is an important hydrocarbon bearing formation in South Sumatra Basin included in Diamond 3D Area. This formation mainly consists of sandstone intercalated with shale. Some cycles of chronostratigraphy sequences happened during the depositional periods of this formation. These sequences control the lateral facies distribution. The facies interpretation in this area needs to consider the specific depositional environment during each cycle. This research focus on facies interpretation within interval that confined by two sequence boundaries, that named by sequence boundary 1 and sequence boundary 2. Some amplitude and frequency-based seismic attributes are analysed and then applied to construct the pattern of facies distribution to trace sand deposit distribution within the interval.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MIRAYANTI (NIM: 22308301)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. Sigit Sukmono dan Dr. Ari Samodra"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Geofisaka Terapan", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Talang Akar formation, facies interpretation, amplitude attribute, variance, spectral decomposition", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Vika Anastasya Kovariansi \u00a0\n                                     Vika Anastasya Kovariansi", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Feb 2012"}
