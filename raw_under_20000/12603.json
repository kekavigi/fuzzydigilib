{"Nomor": 12603, "Judul": "BIDIRECTIONAL EIGENMODE PROPAGATION (BEP) SIMULATION OF OPTICAL ADD-DROP MULTIPLEXER (OADM) BASED ON ASYMMETRIC BRAGG COUPLER", "Abstrak": "An optical add-drop multiplexer (OADM) based on asymmetric Bragg coupler has been investigated, numerically. The device under consideration consists of two planar waveguide with an embedded grating structure on one of the waveguide. The device is expected to be able to add or drop the optical signal through the selected wave channel with very low insertion loss and interference with other wavelength channels. Numerical Bidirectional Eigenmode Propagation (BEP) method is used to investigate the device structural effects on its performance. The optimal result that has been obtained by this BEP method is characterized by 0.971 dropped (added) power, 0.008 of input insertion loss and 0.45 nm FWHM at y = 1511.9 nm.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(Tesis berupa paper)", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ROBERT C.
