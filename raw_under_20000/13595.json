{"Nomor": 13595, "Judul": "PT ABC ASSETS VALUE ANALYSIS IN DETERMINING THE FEASIBILITY", "Abstrak": "The Final Project objective is to solve the existing problem in PT ABC that is to determine the resoluteness of PT ABC assets of two oil blocks that located abroad by analyzing the values of these assets and using comparison of aspects to find the results of the problem. From the problem that exists, these assets are being analyzed using the available method of asset valuation that the Company usually uses. It is quite interesting to know how different is the assets with each other, while one of the assets show a very low potential but gives a high asset value that almost equals the other asset. However, the unpredictable energy prices are the most exciting part of the project, because it is one of the most important aspects in doing the valuation of the assets, knowing that the model is using revenues in the calculation. In the end, the challenge is also included in the process of the determining the forecasted energy prices using an advanced Monte Carlo methodology. The need of learning about the methodology and how to use it from the very basic is really exciting, because there might be no other method to determine the forecasted prices. Not only that, the methodology also be used in determining the most suitable value for the assets even once the values have came out.This Final Project and problem solving quest must have given lessons to be learned by the end of the research. Maybe there are not many lessons to be learned, but the few lessons here have very important meanings to be implemented in our lives. In technical aspect, the analytical skills, self preparation, and organizational skills are needed in any kind of problem solving cases, because these aspects can give a very large contribution in decision making at the end of the day.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "KARTIKA ANISA WIRIADIPURA (NIM 19007054)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Deddy P.
