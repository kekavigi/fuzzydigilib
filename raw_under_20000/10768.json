{"Nomor": 10768, "Judul": "AN EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS OF VARIOUS SIZES OF DELAMINATED FG/EP LAMINATE UNDER COMPRESSION LOAD", "Abstrak": "Delamination buckling analysis of composite panels is considerable interest to aerospace industries. The experimental study was performed to fiberglass epoxy orthotropic laminates with various thru laminates delamination ratio of orientation [(0,90)]20 and [(0,90)4//(0,90)16]specimens. All specimens were subjected under compression load to obtain the critical at which they failed. All experimental data were scrutinized with Euler comparison and shown in one graph. The outcome of the experimental result shown as the a/L increased, the Pcr increased until it reached a/L=0.5 then the Pcr decreased. Comparatively, Euler shown a significant reduction of critical buckling load as the delamination ratio increased. It was concluded that the method of experimental need to be refined with further improvement.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "KHAIRUL DAHRI B.
