{"Nomor": 11401, "Judul": "MODELING AND SIMULATION OF TURN COORDINATOR CONTROL SYSTEM FOR MILITARY AIRCRAFT: CASE STUDY OF N250 PA-2 AIRCRAFT", "Abstrak": "In understanding the principle of turning-hold system for an aircraft, the fundamental of automatic flight control or autopilot must be clearly understood. The main purpose of automatic flight control system is to support pilots in reducing their work loads to fly an aircraft towards a particular destination correctly. This project is focused on the mathematical development of automatic turn coordinator system of N250 PA-2 aircraft using classical control approach. The study is also emphasizing on the objective of reducing the work load of the pilot, particularly during particular mission, i.e precision maneuvering for gunship during tactical assault or during coast guard patrolling, where the aircraft must be able to turn with small radius and constant speed without side-slipping. The control is performed in order to maintain the aircraft at flight attitude, thus ease the pilot in performing the above tasks in such way that his or her physical as well as psychological load can be reduced. The evaluation of the turn coordinator system includes both, the open-loop and closed-loop feedback designs. The output of the study is the gain schedule for the turn coordinator of the aircraft in maintaining the required turning at several different flight conditions.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "SHAHRUL AHMAD SHAH (NIM 23604708)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Prof. Said D.
