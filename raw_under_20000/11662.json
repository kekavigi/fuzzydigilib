{"Nomor": 11662, "Judul": "THE ANALYSIS OF SUPPLY CHAIN INTEGRATION AND STRATEGIC PARTNERING IN THE PRODUCTION OF PANZER APS OF PT PINDAD", "Abstrak": "The basic responsibility of TNI is maintaining the security stability and the authority of the Republic of Indonesia. In performing its duty, TNI will need several military equipment so that the job could be accomplished. Being faced by difficulties in military equipment supplying, which is called ALUTSISTA (Alat Utama Sistem Senjata), the national industry is expected to be able to provide the supply with quality that at least could compete with the equipment imported from other countries. In order to realize this requirement with the limited budget on ALUTSISTA supplying, PT PINDAD is directed to develop and produce Panzer APS.There are several difficulties which cause PT PINDAD could not meet the requirement of TNI in performing the production of Panzer APS. The main factor that causes these problems is ineffectiveness in implementing the Supply Chain Management (SCM) strategy so that the production of Panzer APS is only able to produce 18 units per year, while TNI expects PT PINDAD to be able to produce 50 units per year. As a consequence of this condition, it is needed to be found a right strategy in order to reach the target.Based on Supply Chain Management theory, PT PINDAD has already fulfilled several factors such as: PT PINDAD has already had cluster industry, every component is produced by more than one company, and collaboration with several institutions (TNI R and D, academic institution). Nonetheless, There is no synergy in the relationship built by Prime contractor (PT PINDAD) and Sub tier (cluster industry) and this is happened because there has not been established an integration of all companies which support the production of Panzer APS and this generates a lot of difficulties that cause the production is not maximal.PT PINDAD takes a valuable lesson from Flying geese concept by implementing Supply Chain Integration theory in which all sub tiers that support the production of Panzer APS are integrated well especially with the presence of AIPO (Asosiasi Industri Pertahanan bidang Otomotif) by Ministry of Defense (MoD). This organization is a strategic means of communication because the members are the companies that support the development and production of Panzer APS so that the integration process could work well. Furthermore, this Japan Flying Geese theory could be adopted by PT PINDAD to refine its supply chain management.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "YUDI EKO WARDOYO (NIM 24005039)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. Ir.
