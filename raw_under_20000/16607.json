Moreover, for instance, the textile industry has commonly    \n \n \n \n\nused chloride and sulfuric acid for its fabrication process, the environment that more severe than marine environment. This has led the experiment to investigate an    \n \n \n \n\naustenitic stainless steels in type of 304L and some variants of duplex stainless steels (DSS) to analyze the susceptibility the materials to pitting and stress corrosion cracking (SCC) in mixture chloride and sulfuric acid environment (mix HCl+H2SO4 environment) The specimens used on this experiment were austenitic stainless steel 304L and four variants of DSS i.e. DSS 2101 (lean duplex), DSS 2304 (lean duplex), DSS 2205(standard duplex), and DSS 2507 (super duplex). To see shortly the weight loss    \n \n \n \n\nmeasurement and corrosion rate, the type of corrosion (its susceptibility to pitting and stress corrosion cracking (SCC)), and the passivation behavior in this mix. HCl+H2SO4    \n \n \n \n\nenvironment, this experiment was carried out by immersion test and potentiodynamic test at 60 oC temperature and under several constant conditions maintained, followed    \n \n \n \n\nby surface analysis by macrophotography, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical microscopy. On the potentiodynamic test, the experiment data processing was    \n \n \n \n\naccorded to ASTM standard. The potential scan rate was 1.67 mV/sec with range -0.5 V to 1.5 V potential. The counter electrode was platinum (pt), while the reference electrode was saturated calomel electrode (SCE).    \n \n \n \n\nThe data achieved from the weight loss measurement in immersion test still indicated an outstanding corrosion resistance for all materials according to their corrosion rate values. The observation on the surface of spesimens has not yet indicated type of SCC, but obviously only pitting corrosion that occurred. Good performance of passivation and corrosion resistance have been indicated consistently by DSS 2205 and 2507 whether in unstressed or stressed (U-bent) condition.", "Daftar File": {"2010 TS PP MUHAMMAD YAZDI ALI 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/78615", "2010 TS PP MUHAMMAD YAZDI ALI 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/78616", "2010 TS PP MUHAMMAD YAZDI ALI 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/78617", "2010 TS PP MUHAMMAD YAZDI ALI 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/78618", "2010 TS PP MUHAMMAD YAZDI ALI 1-BAB 4A.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/78619", "2010 TS PP MUHAMMAD YAZDI ALI 1-BAB 4B.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/78620", "2010 TS PP MUHAMMAD YAZDI ALI 1-BAB 4C.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/78621", "2010 TS PP MUHAMMAD YAZDI ALI 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/78622", "2010 TS PP MUHAMMAD YAZDI ALI 1-BAB 6.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/78623", "2010 TS PP MUHAMMAD YAZDI ALI 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/78624"}, "Penulis": "MUHAMMAD YAZDI ALI (NIM : 237 07 003)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Ir.
