{"Nomor": 12972, "Judul": "THERMODYNAMIC STUDY ON VAPOUR-LIQUID EQUILIBRIUM OF TOLUENE and SEVERAL TYPES OF OIL AS ABSORBENT", "Abstrak": "Gas cleaning system is one of important step in the utilization of biomass via gasification process. The producer gas obtained from the gasification process must be very clean before it is used in an internal combustion engine. In order to gaseous fuel get cleaned with a tar content below 100 mg/Nm3, a gas cleaning system using scrubbing oil is being developed and taking the advantage of a lower vapour pressure of oil than scrubbing water. Study on vapour-liquid equilibrium is being conducted to understand the phenomena taking place in the absorption of tar with oil. In our present study, the producer gas containing tar is representated using air containing toluene. This producer gas model with a toluene or benzene concentration then bubbled with a rate of 27.6 mL/min into a bath of oil at a various temperature. The progress of absorption of tar model in oil measured gas cromathograpy until saturated condition. Considering that the concentration of toluene in the gas stream is very low, the toluene and oil vapour-liquid equilibrium follows the Henry\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s law. Prediction of Henry\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s constants is also carried out using UNIFAC-FV model which is known to be suitable for hydrocarbon gases and high-boiling point hydrocarbon solvent.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Hendriyana, Suhartono, Herri Susanto", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["#CONTRIBUTOR#"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "tar, oil, Henry\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s constant, tar, minyak, konstanta Henry", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D", "File": "0 file", "Tanggal Input": "11 Nov 2016"}
