{"Nomor": 12790, "Judul": "A LONG CHAIN ALCOHOL AS SUPPORT IN SOLID PHASE ORGANIC SYNTHESIS", "Abstrak": "Solid phase synthesis is a method by which organic compound synthesis are performed on a support. With solid phase synthesis, purification can be carried out easily by simple filtration and washing procedures. Any left of unreacted reagents can easily be removed at the end of synthetic steps. Another advantage is the solid phase system can easily be automated compared to liquid phase synthesis. Most of supports used in the recent solid phase synthesis are polystyrene based resins. There still exist some limitations in such supports, which is not every reaction can be performed on these polystyrene based resins including reactions which are reactive to aromatic compounds. The other major disadvantages are the difficulties in reaction monitoring and the determination which product is coupled at the end of synthetic steps. At every single step, the product has to be cleaved off from the support, thus can then be analyzed. Long chain alcohol (C-100 alcohol) offers solution to overcome the limitations in polystyrene based supports. Long chain alcohol can be used as a support because of its insolubility in organic solvents. Long chain alcohol has a simple structure which enables it to be stable in various reaction conditions including reactions which are reactive to aromatic compounds.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "YENI NURLELA (NIM 20507023)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. Sadijah Achmad, DEA., Prof. Dr. Adriaan J.
