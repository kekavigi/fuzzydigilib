{"Nomor": 17613, "Judul": "IMPROVEMENT OF SUPPLIER DELIVERY LEAD TIME IN LOCAL PURCHASING SECTION SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT PT FREEPORT INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "In the last quarter of 2008, the world faced global economic slowdown, copper tumbled below US$2 a pound    \n \n\nfor the first time since December 2005 on speculation that the world economy is headed for a recession that    \n \n\nwill reduce demand for metals. Major mining companies are reacting to the reduced demand and some are    \n \n\ncurtailing their production. Some are even being forced to temporarily shut down, including Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. The situation forced Freeport to do some efforts to reduce production cost, in October 2008, President Directors of PT Freeport Indonesia announced his statement on company\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s cost reduction. One of the points is a tighter control in materials usage. Supply Chain Management responded to this situation with making some strategies, with the focus are to reduce inventory and maximize purchasing process effectiveness and expediting to support this goal.    \n \n\nAnalysis for improvement in supplier lead time is an interesting study to reduce cost, in this case, inventory value as the tangible cost, with a number of demands of materials, lead time will impact the order frequency and inventory level. The faster the lead time, the lesser inventory level and value needed to cover the    \n \n\nrequirement. In the opposite, the longer and more uncertain the lead time, the more inventory and safety    \n \n\nstock needed to ensure that required service level will be achieved. The identified issues in this problem is    \n \n\naverage supplier lead time from all purchasing locations which more than standard of 21 days in year 2006-    \n \n\n2008. Further analysis were performed to get an appropriate number and type of stock to be analyzed, and    \n \n\npurchasing process for fast moving item stock class N and level A&B is selected as the best object of study in    \n \n\norder to see the impact and correlation of improvement to inventory value. To narrow the analysis, Papua    \n \n\nlocation is selected as having the latest lead time compare to another locations.    \n \n\nSix sigma framework (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) is used to improve the existing business process. Major problems identified for the cases are unavailability of stock in supplier, additional (revision) order process, and late order information to supplier. After identify some root causes, the solutions for the problems were involving four aspects: Business process, Communication, Technology and Human Resources. The conclusion and action plan for the solutions is a need for agreement between Supply Chain Management and supplier on their performance regarding quality, cost, delivery, safety and environment, improve process control, improve communication, optimize the use of technology, and improve the skill of purchasing team.    \n \n\nThe estimated cost reduction on inventory cost through improvement in supplier lead time is US$ 54,955 for    \n \n\nfast moving materials stock class N, level A&B sourced from local supplier, with increasing 10% in inventory turnover, and the improvement opportunity is open to another purchasing location in Freeport. However, integrated action of the implementation plan from the four aspects and support from management must be in place to ensure that the solutions will solve the problem in the long term.", "Daftar File": {"2010 TS PP YANSEN HENDRA SIRINGORINGO 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/84557", "2010 TS PP YANSEN HENDRA SIRINGORINGO 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/84558", "2010 TS PP YANSEN HENDRA SIRINGORINGO 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/84559", "2010 TS PP YANSEN HENDRA SIRINGORINGO 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/84560", "2010 TS PP YANSEN HENDRA SIRINGORINGO 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/84561", "2010 TS PP YANSEN HENDRA SIRINGORINGO 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/84562"}, "Penulis": "YANSEN HENDRA SIRINGORINGO (NIM : 29107131)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Mursyid Hasan Basri"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Administrasi Bisnis", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "supplier lead time, inventory turnover, supply chain", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "6 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
