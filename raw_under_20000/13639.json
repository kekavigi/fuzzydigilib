{"Nomor": 13639, "Judul": "POROSITY AND FACIES DISTRIBUTION OF BATURAJA FORMATION IN SOUTH SUMATRA BASIN BY USING INTEGRATED ANALYSIS", "Abstrak": "Oil and gas are produced in the onshore of South Sumatra Basin Province. The province consists of Tertiary half-graben basins infilled with carbonate and clastic sedimentary rocks unconformably overlying pre-Tertiary metamorphic and igneous rocks. Carbonate and sandstone reservoirs produce oil and gas primarily from anticlinal traps of Plio-Pleistocene age. The main target of our study is Baturaja Carbonate Formation with age Early Miocene. The ultimate goal of the geoscientist is to determine the reservoir properties such as porosity and lithology. Seiemic attributes and well data including log and cores are a tool to determine these properties. The objective of our study was to produce facies and porosity distributions in the Baturaja Limestone reservoir. The methodology was to run different seismic attributes in combination with well-log correlation and core analogy. The main seismic attribute was inversion that integrates information from well data, seismic data, and geological interpretation. The results of the inversion were acoustic impedance and porosity derived from the simple relationship between porosity and acoustic impedance as observed from the well data. The result of analysis was used to interpret the facies distribution and to map the porosity distribution.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MEHDI MAHMOUDIAN (NIM: 22308312)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Ign.
