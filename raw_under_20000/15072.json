ENKA PARAHIYANGAN PRINTED NEWS MEDIA", "Abstrak": "The only thing that does not change in today\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s ever-changing world is the \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2018change\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019 itself \n\n(Muthu, Whitman & Cheraghi, 1999: 1). Various kinds of organizations are on the lookout \n\nfor new solutions for their business problem to gain more of their performance\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s efficiency \n\nand effectiveness. Such efforts, which typically named the most recent \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2018management \n\ninnovations\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019, provide change concepts considered as good solutions to win the competition in \n\nthis global world. One of them is called Business Process Reengineering. Basically, Business \n\nProcess Reengineering (BPR) is an improvement philosophy. BPR aims to achieve the \n\nimprovement step in performance by redesigning the process through which the organization \n\noperates, maximizing their value added content and minimize others. \n\nPT. Enka Parahiyangan is a private company specialized in printing, located in Jakarta, which \n\nhad been developed from a small company in 1972. Currently, they are one of the leaders in \n\nthe printing industry in Indonesia. With over 250 employees from only 100 employees since \n\ntheir point of start, printed news media industry is the new target market of PT. Enka \n\nParahiyangan. And in the long term, the company has a big ambition in expanding their \n\nbusiness by being the market share leader in this industry. As a company that always faces \n\nchallenge in media printing business, production process in PT. Enka Parahiyangan is critical, \n\nconsidering the cost, quality, service, and delivery are factors to deal in customer satisfaction. \n\nExperience shows, that there is no \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u201cperfect method\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u201d to reengineer processes, but there are \n\nalways opportunities to improve them (Barnes, 1937: 50). Therefore, the concept of Business \n\nProcess Reengineering is necessary to apply in PT. Enka Parahiyangan, particularly in \n\nproduction process. \n\nInefficiency is discovered in the production process in PT. Enka Parahiyangan; as it is derived \n\nfrom the condition of the sheet-printing machine that still involves a lot of manual works, \n\nespecially in the machine setting process, has high operating cost and low productivity. This \n\nis a serious problem as it has caused negative impacts to the entire departments in the \n\ncompany. The overall research purpose is to map the current production process of printed \n\nnews media in PT. Enka Parahiyangan and to reengineer it by suggesting improvements using \n\nsystematic reengineering approach. \n\nThe results show that it is indicated that all procedures in the production process of printed \n\nnews media in PT. Enka Parahiyangan are necessary. Second, besides the condition of the \n\nsemi-automatic sheet-printing machine, there can be found other things to be improved to \n\nincrease the efficiency and effectiveness of the production process, such as the excess of \n\nnumber of daily workers the company hired, the continuous sequence of quality sorting and \n\nfolding sample making process that can be turned into parallel, and the proof delivery and \n\npicking-up activity that consumes a big time of the total operation that can be simplified. \n\nAfter conducting a production process reengineering, such improvement suggestions for the \n\ncompany is to replace the current sheet-printing machine with a 100% automatic one, namely \n\nMitsubishi Sheet-fed Printing Press, with a 1.3 times higher capacity and lower downtime; \n\nhire the same workers for magazine inserting and final sorting process so that the daily \n\nworkers hired can be reduced by 20 people; parallelized the continuous sequence of quality \n\nsorting and folding process that results in space efficiency by 34.2 m2 and cycle time \n\ndecreases by 20 minutes; and letting the customer do some of the work to simplify the proof \n\napproval procedure that results in decrease of 3 transportation activities and 2 delay activities \n\nof the process cycle time.", "Daftar File": {"2012 TA PP ASTRID SARASWATI 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/69420", "2012 TA PP ASTRID SARASWATI 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/69421", "2012 TA PP ASTRID SARASWATI 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/69422", "2012 TA PP ASTRID SARASWATI 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/69423", "2012 TA PP ASTRID SARASWATI 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/69424", "2012 TA PP ASTRID SARASWATI 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/69425", "2012 TA PP ASTRID SARASWATI 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/69426"}, "Penulis": "ASTRID SARASWATI (NIM : 19009157)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Prof. Dr. Ir.
