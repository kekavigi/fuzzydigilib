Delays in construction refer to time overrun either beyond the contract date or beyond the date that the parties agreed upon for the delivery of the project. Delays are disruptive and often contribute on project expenses, hence increasing project cost. Project managers are principally concerned with the introduction and management of change to minimize and/or control the impact of possible project delays. This paper was aimed at exploring the factors that caused delays and challenges that project managers faced in the construction of Rusunawa in Jawa Barat Province such that projects were executed beyond schedule. The study analyzed quantitative and qualitative data from the completed projects in Jawa Barat Province on government financial year of 2008/09, to assess and understand how project managers handled the projects. From the results of the assessment, it was expected that project management challenges could be identified and a proposal for possible solutions made to government. A questionnaire was formulated and interviews were conducted to gather relevant data from all stakeholders who participated in the delayed projects in Jawa Barat Province. Descriptive analysis (comparing responses from various stakeholders with research objectives) of collected data showed that the delays were caused by factors from outside the roles and responsibilities of project managers i.e. factors beyond the control of project managers. However, weakness and challenges on government systems involved in the projects were identified and the solutions have been proposed.", "Daftar File": {"2010 TS PP ARTHUR CHIPIKO 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/69235", "2010 TS PP ARTHUR CHIPIKO 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/69236", "2010 TS PP ARTHUR CHIPIKO 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/69237", "2010 TS PP ARTHUR CHIPIKO 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/69238", "2010 TS PP ARTHUR CHIPIKO 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/69239", "2010 TS PP ARTHUR CHIPIKO 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/69240", "2010 TS PP ARTHUR CHIPIKO 1-BAB 6.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/69241", "2010 TS PP ARTHUR CHIPIKO 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/69242"}, "Penulis": "ARTHUR KAVIIKENI CHIPHIKO (NIM: 25008053)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing :  Dr. Ir.
