{"Nomor": 10795, "Judul": "INVERSE TSUNAMI MODELING", "Abstrak": "Tsunami is one of natural disasters and like other natural disasters; tsunami can not be predicted when and where will happen. A tsunami early warning system will minimize the effect of a tsunami. Tsunami simulation is the heart of tsunami early warning system which provides some parameters from a tsunami such as: time needed for a tsunami to reach shore, the height of tsunami, and inundation area. In order to build a good tsunami simulation a good input is needed and as an input of tsunami simulation, initial wave profile is important. Least square method is used to find the initial wave profile from time signal surface elevation from buoy(s) will be described here. In addition, finite element representation using tent function as base function is used to approximate the initial wave profile. With the intention of validating the method, benchmarking is done with the help of synthetic data. Synthetic data here means is data pretended to be data taken from buoy(s), but in fact the data is obtained from the surface elevation model. Furthermore, the initial wave profile will be fitted to bottom motion parameterization in Pangandaran case. All the discussion here is 1 dimensional; to sophisticate the result 2dimensional discussion is suggested.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "LEVINA DIANSARI SAVITRI (NIM 10105027)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. Andonowati"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "initial wave profile, time signal surface elevation, synthetic data, bottom motion parameterization.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Vika Anastasya Kovariansi \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
