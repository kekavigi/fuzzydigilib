{"Nomor": 15813, "Judul": "APLIKASI MULTIMEDIA UNTUK PEMBELAJARAN BERBASIS SIMULASI HEURISTIK DENGAN KONEKTIFITAS SCORM", "Abstrak": "Multimedia application has an advantage because it is more interesting and has many variations than simple GUI  \n \n\napplication. Multimedia application for learning has the purpose to make learners able to understand the material  \n \n\ngiven.  \n \n\nMultimedia Application based-Simulation Heuristic Module with SCORM Connectivity is developed using  \n \n\nSDLC Throwaway Prototyping. The material from this application is developed using ADDIE model. To  \n \n\ncommunicate with Learning Management System (LMS), this application created based on SCORM 1.2 standard  \n \n\nfor online learning content. Implementation of this application used to support the learning process of General  \n \n\nand Organic Chemistry course and uploaded in LMS MOODLE.  \n \n\nFrom the experiment of extraction simulation that have been conducted learners can evaluate and get the highest  \n \n\nyield from 81 alternatives.", "Daftar File": {"proceedings knsi 2013(1).pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/73754"}, "Penulis": "Gunawan Putrodjojo, Aditya Pranata W", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["#CONTRIBUTOR#"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Multimedia application, Extraction Maceration Module.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Mar 2014"}
