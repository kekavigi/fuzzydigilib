{"Nomor": 13327, "Judul": "TOBIN'S Q INVESTMENT CHANNEL IN INDONESIA (A SECTOR INDUSTRY ANALYSIS)", "Abstrak": "In Indonesia, there is still a lack of research that relates these variables. Indonesia has nine sectors which take parts in the BEI (Bursa  Efek Indonesia) which is agriculture, mining, various, consumer goods,  trade & service, property & real estate, infrastructure-utilitytransportation,  financial, and nature & chemical sector. These sectors  take a role in the market situation; it is about how the market will reflect the price that the company's issued. There is still a question about the  condition of an investment opportunity if it's got affected from what  variable. Therefore, in this final project, the writer will do a research that  has the objective of finding the relationship between the Tobin's Q ratio  and the Investment Ratio of the firm. The research will consist of the  overall Indonesia condition and the sector-industry segmentation  condition.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "BAYU ARDHYANTO (NIM 19006052)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dra.
