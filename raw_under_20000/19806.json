{"Nomor": 19806, "Judul": "OPTICAL SCATTERING RESONANCES OF SINGLE NOBLE METAL NANOSPHERE", "Abstrak": "Metallic nanoparticles have been widely used in nano-scale photonic devices for enhancing their performances or creating novel functionalities due to the highly sen  \n \n\nsitive plasmonic resonance e\ufb00ects. Even since the past, light scattering by metallic nanoparticles have been used until now as the glass staining agent. Recently, variety of useful applications have been reported in the literature, for instance in optical sensing and imaging, photovoltaic cells even medical applications to name just a few. This resonance e\ufb00ect has been intensively studied using Mie theory formulation based on non-dissipative Drude model for the refractive index of the nanosphere.  \n \n\nIn this work, we report the resonance condition on a gold and silver nanospheres of radius a on the basis of maximizing the \ufb01rst order of TM re\ufb02ection coe\ufb03cient. We  \n \n\nfound a modi\ufb01ed Frhlich condition of the real part of the nanoparticle permittivity as a function of the size parameter q. The modi\ufb01ed Fro\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a8hlich condition was then  \n\ufb01tted to the numerical data deduced from the resonance peaks of the scattering e\ufb03ciencies (Qscat) of gold and silver nanospheres. The data agree nicely with the  \n \n\ndeduced approximated analytical relationship above for q < 0.9.", "Daftar File": {"2013 TA PP ADISETYO PANDUWIRAWAN 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/100337", "2013 TA PP ADISETYO PANDUWIRAWAN 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/100338", "2013 TA PP ADISETYO PANDUWIRAWAN 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/100339", "2013 TA PP ADISETYO PANDUWIRAWAN 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/100340", "2013 TA PP ADISETYO PANDUWIRAWAN 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/100341", "2013 TA PP ADISETYO PANDUWIRAWAN 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/100342", "2013 TA PP ADISETYO PANDUWIRAWAN 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/100343"}, "Penulis": "ADISETYO PANDUWIRAWAN (NIM. 10209062)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Alexander A.
