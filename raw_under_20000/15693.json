{"Nomor": 15693, "Judul": "THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE AND CONTAMINANTS TOWARD THE DIELECTRIC PROPERTIES AND DISSOLVED GAS OF SILICONE OIL", "Abstrak": "The ageing or damage rate of insulating liquid used in power equipment depends on several factors such as temperature,  \n \n\nlight, oxygen , catalysts, loadings as well as gas and water content of the insulating liquid. Among those parameters,  \n \n\ntemperature is recognized to play a key role in the ageing of liquid insulation used in power systems. Beside temperature ,  \n \n\nthe contaminants ,such as : catalyst and water, play an important role in increasing the rate of ageing a insulating liquids.  \n \n\nThe effect of those parameters (temperature and contaminant) can be probed by checking the dielectric, physical and  \n \n\nchemical properties of insulating liquids. The aim of this paper is regarded as a main task to investigate the effect of  \n \n\ntemperature gradient and contaminants on the dielectric properties of insulating fluids. For these investigations, silicone oil is used.", "Daftar File": {"2010 TA PP FIDELIS GALLA LIMBONG 1-ASLI.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/73021"}, "Penulis": "FIDELIS GALLA LIMBONG (NIM : 13206148)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Penulis : FIDELIS GALLA LIMBONG"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Dissolved Gas of Silicone Oil, temperature, contaminants, insulating liquid, silicone oil", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
