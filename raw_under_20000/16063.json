The method used \n\nis one method of e-mail filtering is the most popular Naive Bayesian filtering. The method utilizes a theorem of \n\nprobability that Bayes theorem and data mining functionality, namely Naive Bayesian classification. Excess \n\nNaive Bayesian filtering is a high degree of accuracy and minimum error rate.", "Daftar File": {"proceedings knsi 2013(44).pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/75263"}, "Penulis": "Indrastanti R.
