{"Nomor": 11771, "Judul": "CLAYS AS TEMPLATE FOR ASSEMBLING HIGHLY ORDERED TWO-DIMENSIONAL C60-BASED HYBRID MATERIALS USING THE LANGMUIR BLODGETT APPROACH", "Abstrak": "Tuning the molecular arrangement in two-dimensions modifies the physical and chemical properties of molecules. Here I present a new bottom-up approach for the production of hybrid materials based on single and/or multi-layers of clay nanosheets as building blocks. This method, which combines self-assembly processes with the Langmuir Blodgett technique, uses organically modified clay nanosheets as 2D template for grafting of a guest species - in our case C60. It allows for prefect layer-by-layer growth and control at the molecular level. I also report on the characterization of the hybrid materials produced: X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed the characteristic shake-up satellite of the C60 molecules in the C1s core level spectra and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns showed an increase of the clay-platelets basal-spacing up to 10.8 amstrong; both results confirm the presence of C60 in the interlayer space of the organoclay. This approach might open new horizons in the science and technology of photovoltaics (solar cells) and optoelectronics (optical sensors, etc).", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "AKFINY HASDI AIMON (NIM 20207011)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. Yudi Darma"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Fullerene (C60), Smectite clay, Langmuir-Blodgett, XRD and XPS", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Vika Anastasya Kovariansi \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
