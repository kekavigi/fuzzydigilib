TELKOM's decision to expand its business portfolio, not only in telecommunication sectors, but also in information, media, and edutainment (IME) is the right decision. Four similar overseas companies taken as benchmarked companies also show significant increasing performance by making similar changes with TELKOM.

This is done to speed up time to market as the macro environment and the industry changing rapidly.
