{"Nomor": 11135, "Judul": "SIMULATION AND MODELLING IN HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER IN FRYING PROCESS", "Abstrak": "Poultry meat is a popular meat source in Indonesia. However, there are some common bacteria inhibit in poultry that caused foodborne diseases. These bacteria must be inactivated before the meat is consumed by cooking in high temperature. Current research is purposed to simulate the distribution and transfer process of temperature, moisture and oil during the frying process of the poultry meat. Chicken nugget will be used in this research. The heat and mass transfer models are developed and simulated using Femlab\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u0192\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u201a\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u201a\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00ae v3.0. These models then verified with the experiment data. In the experiment, the frying process is conducted with variation of frying oil temperature, frying duration as well as pretreatment methods. From the simulation and experiment, one can determine the optimum temperature and time-needed to obtain good quality meat, both in palatability and safety. The simulation and experiment results showed that nugget frying process was best conduct for 4 minutes at 170 degrees C with preheating treatment from both safety and palatability perspective.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "PHILIP BUDI IVANDI (NIM 13004001)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Ronny Purwadi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Chicken nugget, Heat and mass transfer, Frying", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Rizki Aprianti \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
