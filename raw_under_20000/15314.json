{"Nomor": 15314, "Judul": "INTELLIGENT AGENT FOR PREDICTING STOCK MARKET BASED ON ANFIS", "Abstrak": "Technical analysis is one way to predict future stock prices by observing the trends of data time series in \n\ngraphical form. Besides that, investors need a long time periode to observe and to analyze the data time series. \n\nThis study developed a system to answer this problem by using ANFIS and JADE (Java Agent Development \n\nFramework)-based agent applications. The ANFIS is used to predict future stock prices and the JADE-based \n\nagent application is used to retrieve data from a website and it runs the system automatically to provide the \n\nresults of the stock price prediction. The accuracy of this system that uses ANFIS in this study is 88.25% for real \n\ndata stock and 85.17% for simulation data. In addition, JADE-based agent has been run well for retrieving data \n\nfrom the website and it has run the system automatically to display the results of prediction for the future stock \n\nprice. Therefore, this system can minimalsize the time for investors to predict stock price in the future.", "Daftar File": {"proceedings knsi 2014 full edition(273).pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/70857"}, "Penulis": "Dede Setiawan, Heri Wijayanto, Misbahuddin", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["#CONTRIBUTOR#"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "JADE Agent, ANFIS, stocks market.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "15 Mar 2014"}
