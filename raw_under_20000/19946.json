{"Nomor": 19946, "Judul": "AN EVALUATION OF DYNAMIC LORENZ COEFFICIENT APPLICATION IN SCALE UP PROCESS: A FIELD CASE STUDY", "Abstrak": "A new method of preserving earth model heterogeneity by estimating Dynamic Lorenz Coefficient will be tested combined with Streamline simulation to develop a scale up workflow using Field PTPX fine grid geocelullar model. The new method comprises from four main steps: a) Generate several scale up schemes using 3-D earth modeling software b) Run a streamline simulator on each scale up scheme for few time steps c) Estimate Dynamic Lorenz Coefficient from the relationship between flow capacity and volumetric \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u201cstorage\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u201d capacity. These two variables were calculated across carefully designed set of pseudo production-injection patterns using streamline simulation d) Use finite-difference classical simulation approach to compare performance of the carefully designed set of pseudo production-injection patterns with step-c results.      \n\nTo gauge success and decide on the best representative scale up scheme, a simple implicit simulation scenario will be run on the fine grid and scale up models. This implicit simulation will ensure that the selected scale up model will approximately perform as similar as the fine grid model throughout reasonable and long period of time.", "Daftar File": {"2013 TS PP BAMBANG DWI KRISMARTOPO 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/101437", "2013 TS PP BAMBANG DWI KRISMARTOPO 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/101438", "2013 TS PP BAMBANG DWI KRISMARTOPO 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/101439", "2013 TS PP BAMBANG DWI KRISMARTOPO 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/101440", "2013 TS PP BAMBANG DWI KRISMARTOPO 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/101441", "2013 TS PP BAMBANG DWI KRISMARTOPO 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/101442", "2013 TS PP BAMBANG DWI KRISMARTOPO 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/101443"}, "Penulis": "BAMBANG DWI KRISMARTOPO (NIM: 22211305)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing :  Ir.
