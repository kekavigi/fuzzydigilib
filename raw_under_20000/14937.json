{"Nomor": 14937, "Judul": "DEFINING THE PRODUCT MIX TO OPTIMIZE UTILIZATION AND EFFICIENCY RATE THROUGH STRATEGIC CAPACITY MAPPING ( CASE STUDY IN WOVEN TEXTILE MANUFACTURE)", "Abstrak": "Textile industry has been one of the biggest economy contributors in Indonesia West Java area. Nevertheless, after the CAFTA Agreement in 2010, textile industry in Indonesia has to compete with very tight margin and volatile environment. Changes in business environment encourage textile mills in Indonesia to improve their efficiency and utilization rate to reduce fix cost per unit of fabrics. With the revival of textile industry in the end of 2010, an applicable product mix strategy that utilizes the entire process chain in a textile mill    \n \n \n \n\ncan become the most important source of competitive advantage. The most common process chain combination in polyester filament textile industry lies in its pre-weaving yarn preparation process that includes interlaced, texturizing, and twisting of warn. While interlaced and texturized warp yarn has to undergo sizing process, sizing process for twisted yarn is usually skipped. The variation of the process flow is very crucial in production planning and scheduling. This research aims to provide a generic product mix solution based on the combination of twisting \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2013sizing machine in a weaving mill, thus optimizing its process flow to align with its capacity. It also tries to adopt line balancing method to find the possible additional capacity required to reduce the overall capacity waste. In the future, the research, analysis method and the model derived can be used in other textile mills accordingly. Initial operational data analysis upon weaving production performance reveal that low production rate mainly caused by machine downtime and scheduling mismatch between raw material preparation division and weaving division. In order to align scheduling in each division, a resource planner is needed to allocate each division\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s machine capacity to support     \n \n \n \n\nthe aggregate plan. The combination of the resource planner result is then used to perform a linear programming calculation to minimize the overall capacity waste. The implementation process began with fine tuning the system according to real life situation prior to the trial application. Upon trial application, feedback mechanism on the system has to be built to assure continuous improvement on the system and to maintain system relevancy to real-time production system.", "Daftar File": {"2012 TS PP ANNA CAROLINA LIONG 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/68562", "2012 TS PP ANNA CAROLINA LIONG 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/68563", "2012 TS PP ANNA CAROLINA LIONG 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/68564", "2012 TS PP ANNA CAROLINA LIONG 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/68565", "2012 TS PP ANNA CAROLINA LIONG 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/68566", "2012 TS PP ANNA CAROLINA LIONG 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/68567"}, "Penulis": "ANNA CAROLINA LIONG (NIM 29109385)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Ir.
