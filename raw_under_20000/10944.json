{"Nomor": 10944, "Judul": "CLOSE ROTATIVE GAS LIFT OPTIMIZATION FOXTROT AREA BP WEST JAVA", "Abstrak": "The decreasing of reservoir pressure cause changes to the reservoir fluid properties, such as the increasing value of viscosity and density of oil, and therefore the performance of fluid lifting to the surface decreases. The changing of those parameters will affect to the well production performances, especially for artificial lift wells, such as gas lift wells system. For the purpose of keeping the high performance of gas lift wells system, the evaluation of gas lift performance can be conducted to maintain liquid production rate for gas lifted wells. The evaluation can be started by conducting analysis for individual gas lift well performance up to all the gas lift wells in the field. From those evaluation results, the strategy to maintain field production rate can be mapped, and the solution based on the optimization approach could be conducted.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "M.
