{"Nomor": 19990, "Judul": "CHALLENGES OF WELL INTERVENTION WORK ON HIGHLY-DEVIATED WELLS", "Abstrak": "X-Field is one of ConocoPhillips Indonesia's mature fields located within the offshore Block B Natuna Sea PSC premises. The development for X-Field has been set to obtain production from its dual wellhead platforms, with 20 well slots each. As a direct implication to this scenario, many of X-Field's wells were drilled directionally from either of the wellhead platforms.  \n \n\nHaving delivered oil production since 1994 at 160,000 BOPD, X-Field's production today has reduced to 11,000 BOPD. Various well intervention works have been done in attempt to maintain the field's decline rate. One of the recent works done on X-Field was intervention work on BB-22, opening it's SSD to allow production from additional formation. BB-22 is an oil producer producing at 500 BOPD, and the intervention work was promised to bring the production up by 700 BOPD.  \n \n\nThe challenge for this work had been the high inclination at the depth where SSD is located, 78 degree, had making it hard for a typical wireline intervention work. A wireline run with Roller Boogie was done for this purpose, but it turned out the wireline itself could not transmit the required force to open the SSD. Another solution brought on the table was to use a combination of Well Tractor and Well Stroker run on an electric wireline. The work turned out a success, the Tractor and Stroker are a good solution for well intervention on a highly deviated wells.", "Daftar File": {"2012 TS PP DAMAR PRACOYO 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/101785", "2012 TS PP DAMAR PRACOYO 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/101786", "2012 TS PP DAMAR PRACOYO 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/101787", "2012 TS PP DAMAR PRACOYO 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/101788", "2012 TS PP DAMAR PRACOYO 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/101789", "2012 TS PP DAMAR PRACOYO 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/101790", "2012 TS PP DAMAR PRACOYO 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/101791"}, "Penulis": "DAMAR PRACOYO (NIM : 22210069)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["DR.
