The E.P Company supply the customers with varieties of polyethylene products: High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) Film grade, blow molding grade, injection molding grade, pipe grade and Low Linear Density Polyethylene (LLDPE) film grade. The competitive condition in this business is very high even though the demand for polyethylene product continuous increasing following the economic growth but in same time the new project and the expansion project come on stream, increase supply polyethylene to the market. To increase production capacity on the Low Linear Density Polyethylene (LLDPE) film grade, De-bottle necking in Reactor-2 (reactor dedicated to produce LLDPE grade) done by changing the condensing agent from Isohexane to Isopentane. Due to the production capacity and reliability on the reactor-2 increase, the demand for raw material Butene increase as Butene use as commonomer in the reactor-2 production. In other hand the Butene plant production decrease because of reduction of cooling capacity and efficiency since more tubes on cooler sealed due to puncture during frequent cleaning process for more than 14 years. Due to the demand of Butene increase and in other hand the production of Butene reduce this create gap on the supply and demand for the Butene. The Final project objective to be achieved is to find the best solution to overcomeButene shortage problem to produce LLDPE polyethylene with considering the decision maker consideration and at optimize the cost. To achieve that objective, the SMART (Simple Multi Attribute Rating Technique) apply to enable decision maker to gain and increased understanding of his or her decision problem. The SMART utilized in this project because of the simplicity of both the responses required of the decision maker and the how these responses are analyzed. To fulfill the gap on the supply and demand for Butene, a value tree is created to address shortage of Butene and divided into two component cost and Benefit. Cost consists of: New facility, Loss of production, cost for buy production raw material. Benefit consists of: market demand on favorite type of the product, customer satisfaction on delivery time, raw material continuity, production comfort, and asset utilization. The 5 options available to minimize losses due to Butene shortage are: Replace the 3 pair of Butene reactor cooler, Replace 1 of Hexane tank material with Hexene, Import Butene from outside, Shut down reactor-2 when shortage Butene, Produce high density product. The best solution is obtained after determining the weight of the attribute, measuring how well the options perform each attribute, A Plot of benefits against annual cost for the options, and also conducting the potential problem analysis. The second best option of importing Butene from outside (with the condition the new Butene sphere needs to be constructed) is selected for implementation even thought having value of the benefit (50.9) less than the best option. If the company wants to choose the best option, producing high density product which has value of benefit 68.6, each one point increase in the value of benefits would cost $ USD 515,001.4 and at total $ USD 9,115,524/ year. The option of importing Butene from outside also solves the problem, from attributes view, which are: (a) fulfilling market demand on the favorite type of product as reactor-2 continuous producing dedicated Polyethylene product (LLDPE product); (b) fulfilling customer satisfaction on time delivery time as Reactor-2 produces the same grade that was promised to customers; (c) maintaining the raw material continuity; (d) fulfilling production comfort as running in the same product grade; (e) asset utilization is high due to no reactor shutdown, also less potential for emergency shutdown.", "Daftar File": {"2012 TS PP YULIUS HANDOKO 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/84954", "2012 TS PP YULIUS HANDOKO 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/84955", "2012 TS PP YULIUS HANDOKO 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/84956", "2012 TS PP YULIUS HANDOKO 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/84957", "2012 TS PP YULIUS HANDOKO 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/84958", "2012 TS PP YULIUS HANDOKO 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/84959"}, "Penulis": "YULIUS HANDOKO (NIM 29110107)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Yos Sunitiyoso, ST, M.
