The availability of sufficient power, reliable, secure, and affordable prices are important factors in order to move the economy and improve people's lives. The loss of power supply to some sectors, although in a relatively short time, will inhibit the activity he was doing that would eventually lead to losses. This led to a paradigm that the loss of electricity supply is expressed as a financial loss.  \n \n\nWith an intention to increase the electricity supply capacity, through Government Regulation No. 3 Year 2005 (PP No. 3 / 2005), the opportunity to participate in the  \n \n\nelectricity supply business was opened to all business players in addition to PLN's existing today.
