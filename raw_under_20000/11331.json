{"Nomor": 11331, "Judul": "SYNTHESES AND ACTIVITY ANALYSES OF ISOTHIAZOLONE DERIVATIVES AS INHIBITORS OF THE HISTONE ACETYLTRANSFERASE (HAT) PCAF", "Abstrak": "Histone proteins are a part of nucleosome at DNA chain which records genetic information. The histone acetyltransferase (HAT)- that has a main function to transfer an acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme-A (Acetyl CoA) to lysines in histone tails- is responsible for regulation of gene transcription, involved in growth factor (EGF) stimulation, and the cell cycle. Regulation of histone acetylation is closely correlated to diseases such as cancer, therefore a small molecule HAT inhibitor could be used as a tool for cancer drug development. Herein, 5-chloro isothiazolones and isothiazolones with different substitutions have been studied as potent inhibitors of the enzyme by targeting the PCAF (p300/CBP associated factor) HATs. Therefore, this research is to attempt the syntheses of aforementioned molecules. The results show 5-chloro isothiazolones are produced in a good yield (40-70%), whereas the isothiazolone are produced in moderate yield (20%). The methyl 3-(5-chloro-3-oxoisothiazol-2(3H)-yl) propanoate proved to be the most potent inhibitor of PCAF HAT enzyme and growth factor of cancer cells.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ROSALINA (NIM : 20507028)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. Megawati Santoso dan Dr. Frank J.
