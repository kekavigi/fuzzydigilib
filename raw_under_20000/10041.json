{"Nomor": 10041, "Judul": "PX FIELD OPTIMIZATION USING RESERVOIR SIMULATION", "Abstrak": "Precise scenario development is a very important thing to be conducted in oil and gas field that will ensure production optimization. A comprehensive study can be conducted using simulator, to accurately predict reservoir performance by accommodating geological model under various operating conditions. Reservoir simulation is a tool commonly used in oil and gas industry to help understand field performance and the impact of well work and operating conditions on ultimate recovery.A review of field performance data including a simulation study has been performed on PX field with the view of optimization of future field performance through potential well work and infill drilling, with emphasize on the scenarios that can be applied. The scenario that is offered divided into three which are base case, perforation interval shifting and infill drilling. Based on several parameter analyses, area which still has good oil potential has been identified and simulated on these scenarios, therefore the performance of each scenario can be predicted.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ASNANDA WARDONO (NIM 12204012)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr.Ir.
