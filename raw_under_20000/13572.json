{"Nomor": 13572, "Judul": "TEKNIK PENGHILANGAN GAS KARBON DIOKSIDA DAN PENANGANAN LIMBAH KARBON DIOKSIDA DI LAPANGAN GAS", "Abstrak": "Along with the production of natural gas to the surface, impurity components or so-called associated gas are also produced. The production of associated gas is something that is not desirable, because of the negative effects it has on surface facilities and also decreases the quality of the produced natural gas. Therefore many methods are developed to reduce and maintain the amount associated gas produced on production. This study will discuss on how to eliminate the associated gas primarily carbon dioxide (CO2). There are different kinds of CO2 handling techniques, the selection process based on flow rate and CO2 concentration on natural gas1. This study discusses on ways of handling produced associated gas by combining absorption techniques using MDEA with the hollow fiber membrane module. By using the absorption technique we are then able to determine the correlation between the flow rate of MDEA with the flow rate of CO2.", "Daftar File": {"2010 TA PP IRSYADUZZAQI 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/59460"}, "Penulis": "IRSYADUZZAQI (NIM 12206058)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Ir.
