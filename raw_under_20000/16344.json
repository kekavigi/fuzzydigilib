{"Nomor": 16344, "Judul": "CFD SIMULATION OF AUTOMOTIVE LUBRICANT BLENDING", "Abstrak": "Blending is an ancient art, which, despite being practiced for thousands of years, has been taken granted. It has come a long way during the past few centuries, and in particular, during the past few decades. Many of the recent  \n \n\nadvances are the result of computerized measurement and simulation techniques that are now ubiquitous in laboratories through-out the world.   \n \n\nLubricant is one of the blending product that produced by mixing some types of fluids they are base oil and additives substances. If the blending not perfect, then the result is not homogeneous and then it will make some problem.  \n \n\nThe current blending process in Indonesia, by PERTAMINA  \n \n\n(Pertambangan Minyak Nasional, Indonesia Oil and Gas Company), is conducted through industrial process. For future lubricant product, developed by the PERTAMINA\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u2019s Division of Product Development, the blending process  \n \n\nis carried out by experiments.  \n \n\nHowever, the use of numerical method in the product development of future lubricant is very limited. The numerical method called by the Computational Fluid Dynamics or CFD, has potentials to aid the product development. In this case, the blending process can be accomplished by the  \n \n\nnumerical method first, thus reducing risk and cost associated with experiment. By this way, the properties of base oil and additives can be examined through CFD method before the experiment phase.", "Daftar File": {"2009 TA PP MANGARANAP PARULIAN SIANTURI 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/76907", "2009 TA PP MANGARANAP PARULIAN SIANTURI 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/76908", "2009 TA PP MANGARANAP PARULIAN SIANTURI 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/76909", "2009 TA PP MANGARANAP PARULIAN SIANTURI 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/76910", "2009 TA PP MANGARANAP PARULIAN SIANTURI 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/76911", "2009 TA PP MANGARANAP PARULIAN SIANTURI 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/76912", "2009 TA PP MANGARANAP PARULIAN SIANTURI 1-BAB 6.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/76913", "2009 TA PP MANGARANAP PARULIAN SIANTURI 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/76914"}, "Penulis": "MANGARANAP PARULIAN SIANTURI (NIM : 13604058)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing 1 : Dr. Djoko Sardjadi", "Pembimbing 2 :Dr. Romie O.
