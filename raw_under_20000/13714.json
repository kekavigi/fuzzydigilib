{"Nomor": 13714, "Judul": "SOLAR POWER PLANT IN INDONESIA - A FEASIBILITY STUDY", "Abstrak": "The soaring price of fossil fuel today as one of the non-renewable energy source is a major problem, which has a great impact on some of our country's critical sectors, such as industries, transportation, and electricity. The ever-rising price for some time ahead from now has affected the national power supplier, that is PT. PLN (Limited) which has a number of PLTD (diesel power plant) which uses diesel as the energy source. From a few types of power plant that utilizes renewable energy source, PLTS (Solar Power Plant) is one of the power plants that are currently its technology is advancing rapidly. This can be observed in some developed countries such as Spain, Portugal, United States, Germany, and South Korea, which already started to use solar power plant as their means of providing electricity, although the investment for solar power plant is much greater than one of a diesel power plant's. However, solar power plants are more environmentally friendly than a diesel power plant because the reaction products do not produce carbonic bonds that cause air pollution and global warming.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "NINA CHRISTINA TRANSMISIYANTI (NIM 19006025)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dra.
