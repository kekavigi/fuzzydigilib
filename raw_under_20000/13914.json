{"Nomor": 13914, "Judul": "AVO FEASIBILITY AND SIGNATURE OF TALANGAKAR RESERVOIR IN ALPHA FIELD, JAMBI, INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "The project studied the rock physics properties and AVO sensitivities of the Talangakar Formation which is a sandstone reservoir in Alpha field, based on well log data and using modeling techniques. Petrophysical log analysis was performed to create porosity and water saturation logs. Various rock properties crossplots were created to discern rock properties and corresponding AVO responses from well-log data, as described by Xu et al.(2007).", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "YUDA FAISAL YUSHENDRI (NIM 22308324)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. Sigit Sukmono dan Artini Soekotjo"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Geofisaka Terapan", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "AVO, reservoir", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Vika Anastasya Kovariansi \u00a0\n                                     Vika Anastasya Kovariansi", "File": "8 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Feb 2012"}
