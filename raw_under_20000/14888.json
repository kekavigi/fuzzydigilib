{"Nomor": 14888, "Judul": "ANALYSIS OF MARKET EXPANSION STRATEGY IN GAME DEVELOPMENT SERVICE BUSINESS (Case Study of PT. Agate International)", "Abstrak": "PT. Agate International is a company which focused on game development. Currently, PT. Agate International is one of the largest game developers in Indonesia with over than 70 employees. At first, PT. Agate International focuses on creating Flash-based games that are marketed to the international games sponsor. Over time, in 2010 the market crash because the changes of Google Adsense advertising rule by Google Inc. This external factor then forced PT. Agate International to seek new business opportunities. Within the same year PT. Agate International then opened custom game development service for a wide range of clients need. Starting from there, as the rapidly growing global game industry, PT. Agate International receives many demands of game development from local market. Those demands are divided into 2 categories: game that is used for pure entertainment purpose, and game with additional purpose to advertise, which is commonly called by advergame. In addition for selling its services as a game developer, PT. Agate International also made their own game to be directly marketed to the public. However, this business model despite the promise of huge profit also followed by a high risk. This high risk is due to three factors: revenue will be received only after the product is launched to the market, meaning that initial investment is required for product development. The second risk is due to the tight competition in international market, the game will requires extra quality standards, and this mean substantial initial investment. The last factor is an additional process is required to market the game, which was new to PT. Agate International which only focused on developing game. However, as a game developer, the business model of direct end user monetization is still required to boost the company. Therefore, PT. Agate International dividing its line of production, most production lines is allocated to do game development services, while the remainder will be allocated to develop own game. Resource allocation as a service company however is still needed to support the company, because currently it is responsible as main source of revenue. Thus, this service business model becomes the main focus of this final project assignment. Current strategy of PT. Agate International is to keep stable revenue from game development services by expanding its game development market both geographically and diversify the types of game development services. The implementation of new market expansion is certainly not easy and further study of potential clients by geographic or by usage is needed. Geographically, the analysis will be carried out for international market opportunity. Meanwhile for service diversification, analysis will be done on game with additional purpose other than entertainment, or so-called serious games. This serious games analysis will cover serious game for advertising (advergame), and serious game for training and simulation for corporate employees. From the result of the analysis, this final project is expected to help determine the direction and future of PT. Agate International.", "Daftar File": {"2012 TS PP ANDREW PRATOMO BUDIANTO 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/68222", "2012 TS PP ANDREW PRATOMO BUDIANTO 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/68223", "2012 TS PP ANDREW PRATOMO BUDIANTO 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/68224", "2012 TS PP ANDREW PRATOMO BUDIANTO 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/68225", "2012 TS PP ANDREW PRATOMO BUDIANTO 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/68226", "2012 TS PP ANDREW PRATOMO BUDIANTO 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/68227"}, "Penulis": "ANDREW PRATOMO BUDIANTO (NIM 29109340)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Prof. Togar M.
