{"Nomor": 10264, "Judul": "EXAMINING THE INDONESIAN NAVY CORE COMPETENCES THROUGH CIVIL AND MILITARY INTEGRATION (CASE STUDY: INDONESIAN NAVY HEALTH ORGANISATION)", "Abstrak": "Political challenges and military reform are rising on the National agenda, not least because the military has been suffering from an insufficient defence budget. However, the need to meet the expenses of future modernisation of the Indonesia Armed Forces posture and structure must not be ignored. The Indonesia reform agenda requires that military professionalism is a major focus of attention. Rather than continually raising the defence budget, a process of reviewing and reinventing core competences is essential as it will help to ensure success in the operational task of the Indonesian Armed Forces. An assessment of the current economic system and changing strategic environment will assist in the analysis of how the Republic of Indonesia Department of Defence and The Indonesian Armed Forces can operate simpler, better, and more cheaply thereby reducing unnecessary cost.Defence is not merely a military responsibility; rather it involves civil resources as an integrated component. In a number of senses, the strategic approach of the defence sector is analogous to both public and private sector organisations; whilst in other ways it is considerably different. Nevertheless, there are clear opportunities through a collaborative approach that could enable commercial practices to be used to generate benefit for the Indonesian defence sector.Using the roles, missions and functions of the Indonesian Navy's organisation for the provision of health facilities and services as a case study, this thesis examines the civil and military integration in support of the operational core competencies, and it proposes a suitable approach optimising the supporting health care function.The study concludes that the Indonesian Navy should concentrate on its core competences and, thereby, become a more focused organisation. To achieve this, and recognising the influence of both the Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) and Revolution in Business Affairs (RBA), and the need to sharpen the civil and military integration, an assessment of the Indonesian Navy's non-core organisations is necessary. This will help achieve both greater operational effectiveness as well as cost efficiencies which will help the Indonesian Navy play it part in the security sector reform agenda, whilst facing the challenge of defence in 21st century.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "DITYA FARIANTO (NIM 24005051)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. Ir.
