That is why it is necessary to find an effective framework in how to retain the high-potential employees to stay put and contribute to their existing company.  \n \n\nXYZ is not immune to this problem and they also doing something. They have implemented a good HR system, but now it is necessary to find a framework where each component of the system can be measured to find which one is the most impactful and which one is most important to be prioritized in the implementation.  \n \n\nFocus of the thesis in finding the impactful framework from the components of HR system in retaining the high-potential employees to stay put within the company and measure each of the component to get level of importance of each one.

There are four quadrants produced from this research which grouped into: Financial, Brand, Opportunity, Purpose, and Culture. After the quadrants and reference scores found, a framework called as The Ladder of High-Potential Retention is produced. This ladder will be useful for both XYZ and other companies to identify which components need to be improved and also define milestone of improvement.  \n \n\nMoving forward, after the ladder is found, a site is programmed to be an assessment tool to measure how attractive is the existing employee retention program  \n \n\nof the company. This system will do a modified survey and provide final score that is compared to the best-practice score from XYZ. This assessment tool is an early model that need improvements. Thus, a future research that will improve the current research is well expected.", "Daftar File": {"2009 TS PP HERMAWAN SUTANTO 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/74439", "2009 TS PP HERMAWAN SUTANTO 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/74440", "2009 TS PP HERMAWAN SUTANTO 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/74441", "2009 TS PP HERMAWAN SUTANTO 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/74442", "2009 TS PP HERMAWAN SUTANTO 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/74443", "2009 TS PP HERMAWAN SUTANTO 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/74444"}, "Penulis": "HERMAWAN SUTANTO (NIM: 291073540)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing  :  Dr. Ir.
