{"Nomor": 19478, "Judul": "HANDLING PROCESS IMPROVEMENT OF CONTAINER TO REDUCE REPAIR COST AT PT FREEPORT INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "Management of Container is one of important part of the whole supply chain management process at PT. Freeport Indonesia (PTFI). Due to PTFI Operation area which located in remote location at Papua, therefore all of logistics activity for supporting its operational requirements must be conducted itself. Equipment for  \n \n\nmaterial transporting that is most commonly applied is container, because able to be re-used and can be repaired if any damages. Currently there are more than 8500 units of container (various types) that is managed by PTFI with high value of annual rent and repair cost repair. Good management in monitoring availability of container in good condition (no damage) is required, especially condition either or doesn't destroy hardly is required, especially in maintaining and minimizing the damage of each container for supporting company operational.  \n \n\nEach damage container must be repaired in order can be re-used, the amount of container repair cost and time  \n \n\nis in line with the damage level each unit. In year of 2010, total repair container repair cost that must be paid by PTFI is about US$ 2,8 million with portion 21% for tanktainer type and 79% for non-tanktainer type. The  \n \n\nmajor cause of container damage (non-tanktainer type) is handling process with portion equal to 86%, therefore based on result of root cause analysis with Issue Tree Diagram approach, if find that there are three main causes: improper container lifting and moving, collided by other transportation equipment, and improper loading process of material into container by related parties.  \n \n\nBased on root cause analysis result, hence proposed business solutions which enable to reduce container  \n \n\ndamage that are grouped into two aspects: integrated communication and information and also improve the  \n \n\nhandling process of container. The proposed solution that involve all related parties are distributing container report and information, regular inspection, container campaign, improvement process of container lifting and material loading, mapping of container yard, and scheduling of container movement regarding capacity of container yard.  \n \n\nThe potential reduction of container repair cost by process improvement is approximately ranging from US$  \n \n\n86,706 to US$ 452,362 as the result of container damage level reduction for non-tanktainer type. In effort for  \n \n\nminimizing container damage is open to tanktainer type or other damage category. However, the implementation plan that has been made must be supported by related each party leader (management) to ensure that the solutions will be applied then will solve the problems continuously.", "Daftar File": {"2011 TS PP  SISWANTO BUDIYONO 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/97896", "2011 TS PP  SISWANTO BUDIYONO 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/97897", "2011 TS PP  SISWANTO BUDIYONO 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/97898", "2011 TS PP  SISWANTO BUDIYONO 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/97899", "2011 TS PP  SISWANTO BUDIYONO 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/97900", "2011 TS PP  SISWANTO BUDIYONO 1-LAMPIRAN.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/97901"}, "Penulis": "SISWANTO BUDIYONO (NIM : 29109119)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Mursyid Hasan Basri"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Administrasi Bisnis", "Fakultas": "Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "repair cost, container non-tanktainer type, handling, biaya perbaikan, peti kemas non-tanktainer, handling(penanganan)", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "6 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
