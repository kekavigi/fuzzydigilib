The objective of the shareholders wanting Mitratel to do IPO is to unlock Mitratel value and to finance Mitratel capital expenditure while maintaining the Debt Equity Ratio below 4.0x. Mitratel must assess the value of the company and also asses the IPO plan itself. Undertaking an IPO is a business decision that must be based on consideration of a number of factors.       \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe methods used in this final project to determine the value of Mitratel are Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation and Relative Valuation.

This final project will also analyze the IPO decision based on strategic, financial, and valuation factors, whether or not the IPO will satisfy the objective of the shareholders, and give recommendation of what steps need to be taken in order for the IPO to be successful.       \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFrom the analysis, Mitratel is already eligible to list its shares in the main board of Indonesia Stock Exchange, with the recommended price for Mitratel equity is between Rp. 15.000,- to Rp. 20.000,- per share.
