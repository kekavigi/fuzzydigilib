{"Nomor": 16161, "Judul": "IMPLEMENTASI MULTITHREADING UNTUK MENINGKATKAN KINERJA INFORMATION RETRIEVAL DENGAN METODE GVSM", "Abstrak": "GVSM is one of the models of IR systems. GVSM divided into two processes i.e. preprocessing process namely \n\nreading the text (*.pdf, *.doc,*.docx), tokenization, filtration, stemming, and parse the query and the process of \n\ncalculating the relevance of the document that has been done preprocessing with user query to get the value of \n\nsimilarity. In general, to determine of the effectiveness of IR application is determined by two factors, namely \n\nrecall and precision [7,8,10]. According to J\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a4rvelin and Ingwersen, the effectiveness of IR application is not only \n\ndetermined by the recall and precision, but rather the ability of IR applications in helping users to complete the \n\nsearch more effective and efficient. The effectiveness of an IR application is determined by recall, precision, \n\ntime requirements, and reporting documents are presented to the user [7]. To improve the performance of IR \n\napplications in time requirements is implemented multithreading in the preprocessing process, i.e. stage 1 to \n\nstage 4 GVSM method. The result showed that the method GVSM able to rediscover relevant documents with \n\n100% the precision value, to get the recall value which is equal to the same documents collection either with or \n\nwithout multithreading, but can save processing time by over 50 %.", "Daftar File": {"proceedings knsi 2014 full edition(133).pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/75870"}, "Penulis": "Jasman Pardede", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["#CONTRIBUTOR#"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "GVSM, multithreading,recall, precision, effectiveness.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Mar 2014"}
