{"Nomor": 15495, "Judul": "PREDIKSI LAMA KELULUSAN MAHASISWA MENGGUNAKAN METODE JARINGAN SYARAF TIRUAN STUDY CASE STMIK TASIKMALAYA", "Abstrak": "Information needed on the current increased along with the increasingly rapid technological developments. The \n\nmore information is required then the required data is also growing and the numbers are even greater. The need \n\nfor large amounts of data can be found in STMIK Tasikmalaya Writer, This is because every year there was an \n\nincrease of data. Students especially data that continues to grow each year. The author has conducted research \n\nis to predict the period of study of students in STMIK Tasikmalaya using Backpropagation algorithm, the factors \n\nthat influence the course duration is cumulative GPA, cumulative GPA less then the longer a student to \n\ngraduate, the students know the condition of the party may institute a policy quickly or give warning to the \n\nstudent. The author takes the data on academic and student affairs Administration Bureau (BAAK) STMIK \n\nTasikmalaya then process them using rapidminer, from the research results obtained by using the accuracy rate \n\nof 80.% rapidminer, these results suggest that using backpropagation algorithm so long predicted graduation \n\nrate of students is very high.", "Daftar File": {"proceedings knsi 2014 full edition(188).pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/71850"}, "Penulis": "Egi Badar Sambani, Rahadi Deli Saputra, Evi Dewi Sri Mulyani", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["#CONTRIBUTOR#"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "backpropagation, prediction, students, old graduation", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Mar 2014"}
