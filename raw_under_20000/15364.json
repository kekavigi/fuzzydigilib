{"Nomor": 15364, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT OF WEB-BASED APPLICATION WITH WEB ENGINEERING SECURITY (WES) METHODOLOGY FOR SECURITY ASPECT ENHANCEMENT (CASE STUDY : WEB-BASED SIMAk MM UNPAD APPLICATION)", "Abstrak": "SIMAk MM UNPAD is a web-based application that manages the academic information on the Masters of \n\nManagement Program of Padjadjaran University. Therefore, the application stores a lot of important academic data that \n\nsome of them are sensitive and confidential. This causes the security aspects becomes a major concern in the \n\napplication development so that the stored data can be properly maintained, distributed and utilized. Web Engineering \n\nSecurity (WES) is a methodology in developing an application that focuses on security aspects. WES is a proactive, \n\nflexible, process neutral security methodology with customizable components that is based on empirical evidence and \n\nused to explicitly integrate security throughout an application development process. \n\nThe implementation of WES methodology could assist the development of SIMAk MM UNPAD in \n\nidentifying risk of threats that can attack a web-based application such as SQL Injection and Cross Site Scripting (XSS) \n\nand provide guidance in terms of data distribution that occured in the application according to the needs of end-user.", "Daftar File": {"proceedings knsi 2013(48).pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/71135"}, "Penulis": "Dewi Rosmala, Ghema Ananda", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["#CONTRIBUTOR#"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "SIMAk MM UNPAD, WES, web, PHP, sql injection, cross site scripting.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "21 Mar 2014"}
