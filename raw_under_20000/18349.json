He created a new vision and mission and made organization restructure. The organization that once differs by product was changed to functional organization structure. Business processes such as in project delivery and sales were adjusted to the new transformation goal.      \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe challenge of change in the most frequent and prominent is the resistance to change. Rejection can be clearly visible such as resignation; or it could be implied such as decreased job motivation, increased absenteeism, and so forth. HR has recorded the turnover ratio increased to 50% within first year of change.      \n \n \n \n \n \n\nIn managing change, organizations should have strategic steps that includes culture, leadership, communication, and other interconnection of business elements.
