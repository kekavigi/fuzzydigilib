{"Nomor": 11317, "Judul": "BIDIRECTIONAL EIGENMODE PRAPAGATION (BEP) SIMULATION OF OPTICAL ADD-DROP MULTIPLEXER (OADM) BASED ON ASYMETRIC BRAGG COUPLER", "Abstrak": "An optical add-drop multiplexer (OADM) based on asymetric bragg coupler is being investigated in this project. The device under consideration consists of two planar waveguide with an embedded grating structure on one of the waveguide. The device is expected to be able to add or drop the selected optical signal with very low insertion loss and interference with other wavelength channels. Numerical Bidirection Eigenmode Propagation (BEP) method is used to investigate the device structure. And the results from numerical BEP method is expected to be a bench mark for semianalitical Coupled Mode Theory (CMT )solution that has been carried out previously. The optimal result that has been obtained by BEP method is characterized by 0.971 droped (added) power, 0.008 of input insertion loss and 0.45 nm FWHM at (lambda) = 1511.9 nm.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "ROBERT C.
