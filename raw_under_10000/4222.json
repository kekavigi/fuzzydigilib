They are resistant to degradation and their lipophilic nature and tendency to bioaccumulate pose a threat as a persistent contaminant in the food cycle. However these organohalogens and others like them have been reported also to be produced naturally, biologically and volcanically. The naturally produced organohalogens are found in recent fluvial, lacustrine and marine sediments as well as in sediments deposited several handreds years ago preceding possible anthropogenic sources. It is now thought that naturally produced organohalogens, especially volcanogenic, from the simple chloromethane to the more complexhalogenated methanes, ethanes, ethylenes and CFC's, account for a more significant amount of the total world production than originally thought.", "Daftar File": {"1998_JR_PP_ONG_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/5161"}, "Penulis": "HL.
