{"Nomor": 3037, "Judul": "EVALUASI PEMELIHARAAN RUTIN JALAN TOL", "Abstrak": "As parts of the overall maintenance program, routine maintenance which is especially evaluated in this thesis plays an important role to make tollway and its supporting facilities well maintained. This is because routine maintenance throughout the year is carried out continously. This research is studied to evaluate routine inspection procedure, planning yearly routine maintenance needs and programming 3 monthly projects. For case study, Padaleunyi - Citarum tollway was chosen by analysis the latest 3 years maintenance works, i.e. 1998 to 2000. The results show all Padaleunyi-Citarum tollway inventory data can be inputed on MMS II+ Data base Module relatively complete (except few part of road lateral dimension and channel and few inventor atribute). This data completeness is necessary as reference for year 1999 routine inspection data processing in Routine Maitenance Module of MMS II+. Analysis of the maintenance requirements show the necessity to arrange priority using MMS II+ priority scale, ranked from 1 to 72. Its proposed to make changes towards the MMS II+ priority scale, which are all maintenance object and all type of activity, Rl prioritized as 1 - 24, R2 as 25 - 48 and R3 as 49 - 72. By implementing this priority criteria routine maintenance planning can be arranged form the maintenance requirements list more rasionally and consistent. Next result is next year routine maintenance requirements prediction using simple extrapolation with attention to the fixed and non fixed job item, so the routine maintenance planning can be arranged for the year of 2001. The arrangement of routine maintenance of year 1999 shows that from 166 job item planned with cost Rp. 2.652.891.000, which are programmed as 110 job item with cost Rp. 1.610.179.600 which has been done in 77 job package, 61 by contractor and 16 by PT. Jasa Marga (Persero) itself.", "Daftar File": {"2001_TS_PP_PRAMESTI_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/3439"}, "Penulis": "Florentina Pungky Pramesti", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing I: Djunaedi Kosasih", "Pembimbing II: Ade Sjafruddin"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Sipil", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Sipil dan Lingkungan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "maintenance program, tollway and its supporting facilities, routine inspection procedure.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Feb 2005"}
