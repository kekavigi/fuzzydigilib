It is i mportant to measure time-of-flight because It's have more physics parameter for measurement and nondestructive test, for example: temperature, porosity, crack, volume, elasticity modulus etc. It's research uses 1 6 bit  imer/counter of AT89C2051 microcontroller to measure time-of-flight. The other microcontroller facilities is a small package, internal flash EEPROM, low cost, and serial corrununication system with DART protocol. The Time-of-flight ultrasonic pulse :wave was measured since pulse wave generated by oscillator until received by receiver  ransducer. This measurement moderate from microcontroler port and timer THO and TLO as recorder of the time-of-flight. The output of measurement displayed with seven segment display and transmit to personal computer with RS232 signal level and DART serial protocol. This experiment was varied distance to get  haracteristic of time-of-flight. The research was get 16 bit time-of-flight from TLO and THO. It's generated from 11.0592 MHz microcontroller external X-tall oscillator. The accuracy  easurement system is 1,085 us. It's used linear regression system for instrument calibration by MCS-51 assembly software. This instrument system need proportionally of voltage level, pulse, and frequency of oscillator to get long distance area.", "Daftar File": {"mjl-.-pencacahan-time-of.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/963"}, "Penulis": "Mitra Djamal", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing I: SuryonoScanner:Mudjiono"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Laporan Penelitian", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "propagation, timer, pulse", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Jan 2006"}
