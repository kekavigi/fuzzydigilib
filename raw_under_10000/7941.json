{"Nomor": 7941, "Judul": "THREE-DIMENSIONAL RADIATIVE HEAT TRANSFER COMPUTATION BY MONTE CARLO METHOD USING OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING", "Abstrak": "The exchange factors in radiative heat transfer exchange among surfaces depend on the interaction among the geometry, orientation and the material properties in a complex fashion and unique to a particular geometry and/or material property combination. It is difficult or not possible to extend a set of exchange factors calculated for a particular geometry and material property combination to another geometry or material property combination, even if only the geometry or only the material properties varies. In this final project, an object-oriented computer codes are written to compute exchange factor in three-dimensional geometry with material property combinations. The present computer codes are formulated implementing the Monte Carlo method where a large number of photons are emitted from each surface and traced until each is absorbed by another surface. The fraction between the numbers of photons emitted from one surface and the number of photon absorbed by the other surfaces is defined as the exchange factor. The computer codes are verified by calculating exchange factors in several combinations of geometries and material properties. The exchange factors for various numbers of photons are plotted to determine the convergence curve and compared to the exchange factor from manual calculation. The comparison between the computer code calculation and manual calculation shows that the result is statistically equal. Therefore, the computer codes for three-dimensional radiative heat transfer computation by Monte Carlo method using Objet-Oriented Programming has been successfully developed.", "Daftar File": {"2008 TA PP FRANKY SIMAMORA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/20741", "2008 TA PP FRANKY SIMAMORA 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/20742", "2008 TA PP FRANKY SIMAMORA 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/20743", "2008 TA PP FRANKY SIMAMORA 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/20744", "2008 TA PP FRANKY SIMAMORA 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/20745", "2008 TA PP FRANKY SIMAMORA 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/20746", "2008 TA PP FRANKY SIMAMORA 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/20747"}, "Penulis": "FRANKY SIMAMORA (NIM 13103111)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. Ir.
