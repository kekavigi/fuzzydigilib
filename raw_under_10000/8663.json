{"Nomor": 8663, "Judul": "MODELING TWO DIMENSION INUNDATION FLOW GENERATED BY TSUNAMI PROPAGATION IN BANDA ACEH CITY", "Abstrak": "Two dimension wave run up generated by tsunami propagation over a coastal area is studied based on finite difference model. The initial condition of tsunami wave is taken in the deep ocean line of Banda Aceh City Coastal Area which was determined based on the results of several previous studies. Fully dynamic St. Venant equation is used to assess the flow. The wet dry condition is used to determine the wave run up zone. The governing equation is solved using Mc Cormack finite difference scheme. Numerical filter is applied to achieve better stability. The result is compared to not only to other related numerical model and laboratory results but also to field identification of Aceh tsunami case. Good agreement on wave run up between the model results compared to the experimental data and other numerical model are found. But further study, especially in encountering the wet-dry boundary condition, bottom friction and land use condition, is required to improve the model accuracy in approaching the field data.", "Daftar File": {"2008 GL PP M.
