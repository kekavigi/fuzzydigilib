So far, the quality evaluation of tea processing, including the color of the tea solution, is done by a taster. As a result this kind of color-inspection method would be fully affected by subjectivity of each individual taster, so it  \nwould be difficult to make a standard applied for the tea inspection. This paper describes a research that has been conducting to design and implement a method for color-inspection of tea solution. The method is implemented by taking still-picture of tea solution and then analyzes it to obtain its tristimulus value  \nusing digital imaging. The still-picture can consist of hundreds to million of pixels, depending on the size of the taken still-picture, and each pixel has its own tristinnihis value. So, it would be easier if the  \ntristimulus values were presented in a histogram. By using this method, the different color of tea-solution can be distinguished quite well. Comparing the results obtained from taster, it was found that sometimes  \nthe taster evaluates the color of tea-solution inconsistently. In this research, the black tea was produced from a tea factory at Gambung Ciwidey - West Java, whereas the evaluation was performed by 3 professional tasters.  \nKeywords . color histogram, black tea, tea quality, taster, tristimulus", "Daftar File": {"Muntini, MS": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/965"}, "Penulis": "Muntini, MS", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Nazaruddin,Wisnu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Laporan Penelitian", "Penerbit": "Teknik Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknologi Industri", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "color histogram, black tea, tea quality, taster, tristimulus", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "09 Agu 2004"}
