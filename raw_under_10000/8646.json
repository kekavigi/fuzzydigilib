{"Nomor": 8646, "Judul": "AN ARRAY OF FOUR TRIANGULAR SLOT ANTENNAS WITH RECTANGULAR TUNING STUB FOR DUAL-BAND WIRELESS LAN APPLICATIONS", "Abstrak": "An array of four single element of triangular-slot antenna with rectangular tuning stub for 2.4/5.8 GHz wireless LAN applications is proposed. The antenna is designed and implemented on FR4 epoxy substrate and occupied an area of 165 x 145 mm2 with 1mm of microstrip thickness. The triangular slot is fed by a 50 \u03a9 probe that is placed at the center of the transmission line. Based on the simulation results, the impedance bandwidth for VSWR 2:1 is about 260 MHz (2.36 GHz-2.62 GHz) covering the 2.4 GHz band and 225MHz (5.6 GHz- 5.825 GHz) covering the 5.8 GHz band. As a transmitter, the antenna has 8.2 dBi gain in 2.4 GHz band and 8.5 dBi gain in 5.8 GHz band. As a receiver, the antenna has 8.5 dBi gain in 2.4 GHz band and 8.6 dBi in 5.8 GHz band. The simulation results for return loss, radiation patterns, and gains are presented and discussed.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "MOHAMMAD IMADUDDIN (NIM 13203163)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing:  \n \n\nDr.Ir.
