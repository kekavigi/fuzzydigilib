{"Nomor": 778, "Judul": "TEMPERATURE COMPENSATION OF A TRANSISTORIZED PULSE SEQUENCE GENERATOR", "Abstrak": "A circuit for a transistorized pulse sequence generator was set up on a breadboard in the laboratory. To observe the effect of the temperature, the breadboard was put in the oven and heated from 82\u00c2\u00b0F to 206\u00c2\u00b0F, The output pulse was observed with a dual-trace oscilloscope; the width of the pulse was found to decrease when the temperature increased. This effect was compensated with a Western Electric thermistor (nonlinear compensation).", "Daftar File": {"1966_TS_PP_LATJENO_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/1042"}, "Penulis": "Ilse Latjeno", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing 1: Nathan B.
