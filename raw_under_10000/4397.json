{"Nomor": 4397, "Judul": "CONCURENT INTERFEROMETRICAND CALORIMETRIC MEASUREMENTS OF STEADY FREE CONVECTION HEAT TRANSFER COEFICIENTS OF HORIZON TALLY-BASED, VERTICALLY-FINNED MINIATURIZED ARRAYS", "Abstrak": "ABSTRACT:  \n Course Description The purpose of this research project is to integrate an existing calorimetric experimental set up for investigation of the effects of miniaturization of the base plate on the steady state heat dissipation rates of horizontally-based, vertically finned arrays with a newly developed differential interferometer to form a concurrent system. This system was designed to enable concurrent calorimetric and interferometric measurements of local free convection heat transfer coefficients of miniaturized fin arrays. To this end more flexibility, however, had to be built in into the differential interferometer before integration could be affected. Similarly, the range of total temperature measurement locations of the calorimetric set up need to be extended as well as the associated data processing capability. In this respect the use of very fine thermocouple wire would be required to render the system operational.", "Daftar File": {"2004_LP_PP_HARAHAP1_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/5414"}, "Penulis": "Filino Harahap',", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Peran:  Filino Harahap Scan: Dikdik Suhendi (2006-06-08)"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Laporan Penelitian", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "vertically finned arrays; concurrent system; enable concurrent calorimetric", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Jun 2006"}
