{"Nomor": 7499, "Judul": "SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION FOR POST MINE CLOSURE IN GOLD MINE (PT KEMS CASE FOR LOCAL MINING COMMUNITY)", "Abstrak": "Post mine closure is a critical stage of a gold mine especially for a company that has maintained great attention to the environment. There is a different perception of economic value of tailings, waste and abandoned pit between the company and local mining communities (artisanal miners). Artisanal miners provide a cash based input to rural areas, adding to and assisting agricultural pursuits, strengthening the economic infrastructure, assisting to alleviate rural poverty. A major environmental problem can be developed by the local mining community by disturbing the existing of mining operations and post mine closure programs and validated by the wider community. To reduce the risk of disturbances of KEMs post mine closure program, the verification program which involves local mine communities, local knowledge, local technologies and safe mining practice was carried out with total transparency between KEM and the local community. To attempt a long term solution KEM carried out an environmental education and awareness programs with artisanal miners, school children and women who usually lack the opportunity to participate in such programs. Artisanal miners simple technologies can not prevent mercury pollution in the environment. Simple and cheap equipment to safely recover mercury from amalgam has been introduced to artisanal miners along with an awareness campaign about the risks of mercury poisoning.", "Daftar File": {"file_Chusharini_IMA_Kelian_20paper.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/17562"}, "Penulis": "CHUSHARINI CHAMID1, B.
