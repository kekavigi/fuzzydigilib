Evaluation of antitussive effect was performed according to Charlier method, with some modification on it's detector using voltmeter and aerosol tusigen. The extract was able to decrease cough frequencies at dose of \u20ac 562.34 mg/kg, but not to cough intensity. Evaluation of respiratory tract mucus production effect was performed tracheotomically according to Rosbach method. The extract increased mucus production in respiratory tract at dose of \u20ac 316.23 mg/kg. Effect of extract on mucus consistency was evaluated using rheological method, in vitro, and it's showed that the higher the extract concentration, the lower the mucus viscocity. The experiment also conducted the antimicrobial effect on many strains of tracheal invection-induced bacteries. The results showed that the extract possessed antimicrobial activity against Hczerraophi L Lus influenza-e, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus haemoLiticus beta.", "Daftar File": {"1990 HELMI ARIFIN": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/2438"}, "Penulis": "HELMI ARIFIN", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing I: N.C Soegiarso", "Pembimbing II: Andreanus A.
