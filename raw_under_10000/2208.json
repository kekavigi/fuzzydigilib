In order to meet this criteria, a lot of researches have been done to investigate chromaluminide coating on Ni-based superalloy substrate. The assessment of chromaluminide coating on pure Ni substrate has been conducted using duplex method, which is a two stage diffusion coating. The initial stage is cromizing process, and the second stage is an aluminizing process with high Alactivity. Result of duplex coating process mentioned above is a chromaluminide coating, wich consist of -NiAI phase, 6-Ni2A13 phase, and a-Cr precipitates. These results are obtained through chromizing process at 1100 \u00c2\u00b0C for 4 hours using 3 % NH4C1 activator, and alumunizing process at 900 \u00c2\u00b0C for 30 \u00c2\u2013 100 minutes, using the mixed activator of 1 % NH4CI + 4 % NaCl. Isothermal and cyclic oxidation tests, as well as hot corrosion test in a Na2SO4 salt bath have been conducted in still air at 900 \u00c2\u00b0C during 4-16 hours, toward the chromaluminide coated samples. The oxides for med consist of Al203, Cr203, NiCr2O4 spinel and Ni Al204. From the experimental results, it is concluded that : a. Dupex coating method on Ni results in aluminide coating wich consist of a-Cr precipitates. b. The chromaluminide coating is found to be resistant to isothermal oxidation at 900 \u00c2\u00b0C for 16 hours. c. The chromaluminide coating is found to be resistant to cyclic oxidation until 35 cycles ( 1 hour in furnance, 15 minutes outside furnance ). d. The chromaluminide coating is oxidized and form spine] ( NiCr2O4, NiAl2O4) at 900 \u00c2\u00b0C in Na2SO4 salt bath in amount of 1,9 \u00c2\u2013 2,0 mg/cm2 for 12 hours. By using larger amount of salt bath (3,5 \u00c2\u2013 3, 8 mg/cm2) the chromaluminida coating is tend to suffer hot corrosion attack.", "Daftar File": {"1998 RETNO INDARTI": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/2566"}, "Penulis": "RETNO INDARTI [22194035]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing I: Isdiriayani", "Pembimbing II: Sunara Purwadaria,  Scanner: Irwan Sofiyan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Pertambangan", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Pertambangan dan Perminyakan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "NIKEL DENGAN METODE PELAPISAN DUPLEKS", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Nov 2004"}
