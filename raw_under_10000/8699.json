{"Nomor": 8699, "Judul": "SUBSURFACE UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT USING EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN IN GAS CONDENSATE RESERVOIR", "Abstrak": "The observed field is a gas condensate field with reservoir pressure near the dew point. The possibility for differences in interpretation and for some properties distribution in this reservoir is large. The main objectives in this study are to quantify the uncertainties from geology, geophysics, and petroleum engineering, and to quantify their impact on Gas Initial In Place (GIIP) and the recoverable reserves. The decisions for the plan of development in the future will be better. Experimental Design (ED) is used to establish the minimum number of scenarios needed to quantify uncertainty.With this method,uncertainties were placed into three classes which are low, middle, and high class. The work was carried out in six main steps: \n \n \n \n\n1. Define the subsurface uncertainties and their ranges     \n \n \n\n2. Perform experimental design     \n \n \n\n3. Create proxy equation     \n \n \n\n4. Create S-curve of Gas Initial In Place (GIIP) or recovery using proxy equation    \n \n \n\n5. Building deterministic P10-P50-P90 base models     \n \n \n\n6. Use base model for plan of development", "Daftar File": {"2008 TA PP MUHAMMAD BAGIR 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/26013"}, "Penulis": "MUHAMMAD BAGIR (NIM 12204008)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["#CONTRIBUTOR#"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Gas condensate, Uncertainties, Experimental Design", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Vika Anastasya Kovariansi \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
