{"Nomor": 7569, "Judul": "HIGH-RISE HOUSING AS AN ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION IN URBAN HOUSING DEVELOPMENT", "Abstrak": "ABSTRACT:    \n \n \n \n \n\nThe development of large cities has been characterized by a high population rate. High population will cause pressure to the city to fulfill the demand of its habitant. This can be seen by the existence of poor living conditions which can resulted negative impacts to the environment. Housing development, particularly, is mushrooming in many parts of the urban area, responding not only for the demand of local people, but also buyers from people outside the urban area. Such housing development unfortunately happens in a situation by which urban growth management is ineffective in the urban area. The result of that problem is a scattered-urban sprawl which is causing many negative impacts to urban development and management, such as: inefficient use of land, vacant land, land conversion of productive agricultural land and watershed area, inefficient infrastructures, travel costs and air pollution, and more land speculation.    \n \n \n \n \n\nThis research analyses the urban housing in Indonesia, particularly in Jakarta, towards the high-rise housing in its policy and plan, with also elaborating high-rise housing concept in other countries that have successfully applied the high-rise housing concept, namely United Kingdom (UK), the Netherlands, and Singapore. By this research, we can comprehend high-rise housing as an alternative solution in urban housing development and high-rise housing policy is not an independent process made by the government. It should be influenced by other factors, the perspective of the people such as the needs of the community. Although governmental system in Indonesia has been changed from centralized to decentralize but in implementation the planning system in Indonesia is still more on top-down, so it is still difficult for the community to speak up what they need to the government.  Therefore, to improve community participation in policy decision making needs collaborative planning. In addition, learning from other countries which have already implemented high-rise housing concept is really necessary to promote high-rise housing development.    \n \n \n \n \n\nThis research is expected to contribute theoretically to promote high-rise housing in urban area, to be more adaptable and useful for urban community. In practice, it is also expected to provide a lesson on how housing policy should be developed in order to be more grounded and well-implemented.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Dela Herfyria Taufiq (NIM 25405006-RuG: S1623354)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Supervisor I: Justin Beaumont, Dr. (RuG Supervisor)    \n \n \n \n \n\nSupervisor II: Haryo Winarso, Ir., M.
