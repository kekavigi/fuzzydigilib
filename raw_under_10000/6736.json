Creep is a deformation that occurs in rock when receiving a continuously constant tension. Loading of rock is one of special treatments that is done to determine mechanical properties of rock and the behavior could be observed by means of rock strength test in a laboratory. One of the tests  s triaxial creep and is carried out to analyse creep behaviour on rocks. The analysis of rocks is done because, commonly, creep has negative effect, that could decrease long term stability.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Sahat Japipin FBM (NIM 12101048)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Scanner: Arnaz Driyastika M.   \n \n \n \n\n(2007-11-26)"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "trebeccia rocks", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ena Sukmana", "File": "6 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
