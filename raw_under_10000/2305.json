{"Nomor": 2305, "Judul": "THE CHANGES IN THE MOISTURE BUDGET DURING THE 1978-79 SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE SUMMER MONSOON", "Abstrak": "Utilizing FGGE Level IIIb data, the moisture balance over an \nextensive region (30\u00c2\u00b0S - 30\u00c2\u00b0N, 60\u00c2\u00b0E - 120\u00c2\u00b0W) during the 1978-79 Southern \nHemisphere summer monsoon is analyzed. In this study, the onset and the \nbreak periods are defined by the changes in the moisture budget over the \nnortheast Australia - western South Pacific region (7.5\u00c2\u00b0 - 22.5\u00c2\u00b0S, 135\u00c2\u00b0 - \n165\u00c2\u00b0E). The analysis shows that the major moisture source regions for \nthe monsoon rainfall are the Indonesian Seas (0\u00c2\u00b0 - 12\u00c2\u00b0S, 95\u00c2\u00b0 - 120\u00c2\u00b0E) and \nthe subtropical South Pacific off the east coast of Australia. The \ncontribution of the Northern Hemisphere moisture flux is less than these \nSouthern Hemisphere sources. The monsoon activity shifts eastward and \nsouthward from pre- to post-onset. During the break period, the monsoon \nactivity shifts still further eastward and poleward. \nThe moisture convergence pattern over Australia illustrates some of \nthe similarities between the break conditions for the Southern Hemisphere \nsummer monsoon and the Indian monsoon. The strong moisture convergence \ncenter over northeast Australia (about 15\u00c2\u00b0S, 140\u00c2\u00b0E) during the active \nperiod splits into two centers during the break period. The stronger \ncenter is situated around 20 \u00c2\u00b0S, 140\u00c2\u00b0E and is about 5\u00c2\u00b0 poleward of the \nprevious active period position. The other center is more equatorward at \naround 7.5\u00c2\u00b0S, 140\u00c2\u00b0E. \nDuring the break period, a strong interhemispheric moisture exchange \nexists over the central Pacific between the dateline and 150\u00c2\u00b0W. A \nprominent cross-equatorial moisture flux between 150\u00c2\u00b0E - 1800 merges into \nthe equatorial westerly moisture flux. This westerly moisture flux \nextends eastward across the dateline and becomes a strong northerly \nmoisture flux around 150\u00c2\u00b0W in the South Pacific. \nThe northeastern Indian Ocean west of Indonesia is a key area for the \nmoisture balance in the Indonesian region. When the moisture flux from \nthis area reaches a maximum, the moisture convergence over the Indonesia \nregion is also at its peak. When this flux decreases, the moisture \nconvergence also drops.", "Daftar File": {"1984 SAUT MARULI LUBIS": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/2665"}, "Penulis": "SAUT MARULI  LUBIS", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: T.
