{"Nomor": 9204, "Judul": "LONTARA-FIELD DEVELOPMENT OPTIMIZATION USING RESERVOIR SIMULATION", "Abstrak": "Plan of Development (POD) is a very important thing that have to conducted in oil industry, whereas a lot of money needed to producing an oil field. A comprehensive Plan of Development can be conducted thriftily by using simulator, which can predict reservoir performance accurately by accommodating the geological model under various operating condition. LONTARA-Field can be considered as a marginal field/brownfield. Marginal field is an oilfield with declining production rate. The Development of marginal field can be done by adding more wells (infill drilling) or optimizing the existing wells. The POD that offered in LONTARA-Field can be divided into six scenarios that are base case, workover, infill drilling, workover+infill drilling, peripheral water injection, and pattern water injection. Area that still have a good oil potential based on analysis of several paremeters then implemented into five development scenario that offered by reservoir simulation. Therefore the production profile and its incremental oil recovery can be predicted, therefore by this study, the best Plan of Development scenario can be recommended to be implemented in LONTARA field.", "Daftar File": {"2008 TA PP SAKTI TANRIPADA 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/29528"}, "Penulis": "SAKTI TANRIPADA (NIM 12204051)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["#CONTRIBUTOR#"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Reservoir Simulation, Plan of Development, Workover, Infill Drilling, Peripheral Water Injection, Pattern Water Injection, Incremental Recovery", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Vika Anastasya Kovariansi \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
