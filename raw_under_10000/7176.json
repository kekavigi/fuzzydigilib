{"Nomor": 7176, "Judul": "SEISMIC RESISTANCE OF LOW RISE BUILDING", "Abstrak": "There are hundred-thousands low rise building which are built every years through out Indonesia. It might be designed by unfamiliar-with-seismic-design engineers, even by non engineers. Therefore, simplified seismic resistant design manual is absolutely a need. In this paper, requirements for seismic resistance in Indonesian Concrete Code (SNI) was extracted for more simple guidance manual. Study of seismic resistance design is carried out by taking the advantages of limited choices of typically low rise building parameters in Indonesia such as maximum column-to-column span, build ability of structural members dimension, reinforcement bar diameter, economical constraint. More effective way to understand how one can design a seismic resistance low rise building is by simple approach through illustration drawing which is completed by charts, tables and simple explanation.", "Daftar File": {"2008 GL PP AMRINSYAH NASUTION 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/15252"}, "Penulis": "AMRINSYAH NASUTION", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Abdul Haris"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Literatur Kelabu", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "seismic resistance, low rise building, Concrete Code (SNI)", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Vika Anastasya Kovariansi \u00a0\n                                     Vika Anastasya Kovariansi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Mei 2008"}
