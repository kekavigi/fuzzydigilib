{"Nomor": 745, "Judul": "Klasifikasi Kondisi Pikiran Terhadap Rangsangan Suara dengan  \nAnalisis Spektral Daya", "Abstrak": "Human mental tasks are influenced by some variables, such as the sound stimulation which is used for  \nemotional therapy by physicians. Although human perceptions toward sound stimulation are different  \nfrom each other, generally we can find or develop sound sources which can cause certain mental task. For  \ntherapy evaluation, we need EEG as the measurement instrument and identification and classification  \nsystem that has developed in this research, based on power spectral and apriory knowledge about the EEG  \nsignal. Alpha wave will appear at relax condition, theta wave when sleepy or at emotional stress, and beta  \nwave relates to non-relax condition. The EEG signal is evaluated toward 12 sound stimulations. Each  \nsound source was given to 3 subjects repeatedly. As a validation, we observed facial expression and  \nknowledge about the sound stimulation.  \nThe research showed that power spectral analysis can be used as a mental task classification system  \nmodel. From 12 sound stimulations, about 41% gave sleepy, 36% relax, and 23% non-relax condition.  \nSleepy condition was dominant at fast beat music and the end of measurement. The result gives that EEG  \nspectral of symmetric channels are asymmetric.", "Daftar File": {"Proc-Klasifikasi-kondisi-pikiran...kory.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/1008"}, "Penulis": "Esmeraida C.", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Esmeraida C.
