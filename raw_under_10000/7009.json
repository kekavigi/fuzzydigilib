{"Nomor": 7009, "Judul": "PROBABILISTIC SEISMIC HAZARD ASSESSMENT AND STRUCTURAL PERFORMANCE AGAINST SEISMIC ACTIONS", "Abstrak": "This paper describes various studies and research activities in the field of earthquake engineering carried out in Indonesia. These researches address some efforts on probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) to estimate peak ground acceleration at baserock, site effect, response spectra, and earthquake impacts on some structural details. Summary on some results of the current PSHA with respect to the recent advances in seismic hazard and ground motion analysis is presented. These studies have been carried out for input to revision of the Indonesian seismic code for buildings. The results of the researches and studies show some basic agreements. More studies are needed before compiling these studies into new code. Complementary studies and researches are carried out on the seismic design methodology. The design concept is based on the energy approach. Since this method is far from being used world wide, further studies are still needed before being adopted into any seismic design code.", "Daftar File": {"2008 GL PP ADANG SURAHMAN 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/14090"}, "Penulis": "ADANG SURAHMAN", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["I Wayan Sengara dan Widiadnyana Merati"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Literatur Kelabu", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "probabilistic seismic hazard assessment, structural performance, seismic actions", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Vika Anastasya Kovariansi \u00a0\n                                     Vika Anastasya Kovariansi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Mei 2008"}
