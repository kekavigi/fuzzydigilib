This method is used for determining the elastic modulus of material from the velocities of seismic waves propagating through the material or soils. Review of current wave propagation methods shows that the methods are susceptible to noise, making interpretation of field data a difficult task.\nThe Time Delay spectrometry (TDS) method was invented by R.C. Heyser (1967) for characterizing an acoustical system in a reverberant environment. The method offers a new method to isolate and estract a signal from noise based on the signals time delay. The characteristics of the TDS method are :\na)\tIt utilizes a swept frequency signal from a initial frequency to final frequency linerly.\nb)\tThe swept frequency signal is transmitted from a transmitter (vibrator, etc.) and\nafterpropagating through the medium, the incoming signal is accepted by receiver\n(accelerometer, atc.).\nc)\tThen, a tracking filter selects the signal based on its delay time. The filter consist of a narrow bandpass filter that is swept linearly with the same rate as the transmitted signal.\nThis research determines the density of material such the sand and soil by down-hole measurements. The direct wave propagating through the probe body could be easily distinguished from the wave propagating through the soils from their peak times. The seismic wave would travel significantly faster through the probe body, that may be made of steel, than through soils. Therefore, they are easily distinguished one from the other.\nThe result of mesurements made on sand box and borehole indicate time delay 1447,4 p.s and 1170,7 us respectively. By deviding distances between vibrator and accelerometer 0,255 m, with time delay, therefore it was found that the shear wave velocity in the sand 176,18 m/s and in borehole 217,82 m/s for the depth of 0.51 meters.", "Daftar File": {"1997 TS PP AMIRDAS 1-cover.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/15189", "1997 TS PP AMIRDAS 1-bab1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/15190", "1997 TS PP AMIRDAS 1-bab2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/15191", "1997 TS PP AMIRDAS 1-bab3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/15192", "1997 TS PP AMIRDAS 1-bab4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/15193", "1997 TS PP AMIRDAS 1-bab5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/15194", "1997 TS PP AMIRDAS 1-bab6.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/15195", "1997 TS PP AMIRDAS 1-pustaka.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/15196"}, "Penulis": "Amirdas (NIM 202 94 507)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Gunawan Handayani , MSCE, PhD.\nScanner : Novian Kurniawan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Geofisaka Terapan", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "time delay, spectrometry, suspended S logging.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "8 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Jan 2008"}
