{"Nomor": 2154, "Judul": "STUDY OF GALACTIC STRUCTURE BASED ON M-TYPE STARS", "Abstrak": "This thesis presents the new knowledge of the luminous stars of K-M type, i.e., K-M supergiants, Miras, and K-M giants, obtained from the ground-based optical/near infrared survey and the infrared survey made by the IRAS satellite as well as the result of the statistical study of the Galactic structure using the luminous K-M star candidates selected from the IRAS point sources. In Chapter 2 M star survey at Bosscha Observatory (hereafter abbreviated as BMSS) is described. The survey consist of 20 5\u00c2\u00b0 x 5\u00c2\u00b0 fields confined in the area of t = 330\u00c2\u00b0 - 30\u00c2\u00b0 through e = 0\u00c2\u00b0 and (b I< 2 An M star Catalogue for BMSS Fields 8, 9 and 10 is presented. This is called the BMSS M star catalogue hereafter. The highest surface number density of M stars is found to coincide with the region of the sky where the 2.4 pm enhancement exists (t - 355\u00c2\u00b0 and b - 1 \u00c2\u00b0). The limiting distance of the BMSS is estimated by comparing the number of the detected M stars with the number predicted by a model of star distribution. The interstellar extinction is then estimated using the limiting magnitude of the BMSS, the limiting distance, and the assumed absolute magnitude of the late-M giants. The map of the resultant extinction is presented with a resolution of 0.\u00c2\u00b05 x 0.\u00c2\u00b05. The visual interstellar extinction per kiloparsec av and the limiting distance rum averaged over 351\u00c2\u00b0 < \u00c2\u00a3 < 10\u00c2\u00b0 are 1. 8 mag kpc-1 and 4.0 kpc in 1\u00c2\u00b0", "Daftar File": {"1996_TS_PP_RAHARTO_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/2510"}, "Penulis": "Moedji Raharto", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Scan: Agus"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Disertasi", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Galactic Structure; M-Type Stars", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ena Sukmana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Nov 2004"}
