The estimation used \ninput variables of longitudinal speed (U.) as input variable and by sideslip angle (Q;) estimated \npreviously based on full car mathematical model. The mathematical model computes forces that work on \neach wheel of the car. Then by computer simulation the slip angle estimated has been examined. The \nresults of estimation show the slip angle has non linear correlation with longitudinal speed. The largest \nslip angle value is at wheel number 4 (rear left) and the smallest is at wheel number 3 (rear right ). So \nwheel angles are required by the 4WS has non tinier correlation by longitudinal speed. At low-middle \nspeed, the rear wheels angle move to opposite direction with the front wheels but at middle-high speed, \nthe rear wheels angle move to the same direction with the front wheels.", "Daftar File": {"Proc-Estimasi-Sudut-slip-Roda....Kory.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/1007"}, "Penulis": "Bambang Sampurno", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Bambang Sampurno, Harijono A Tjokronegoro z"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "estimation; slip angle, lateral force, vertical force and wheel angle", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Mahmudin", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "16 Jan 2004"}
