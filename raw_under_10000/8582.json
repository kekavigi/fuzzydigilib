{"Nomor": 8582, "Judul": "NUMERICAL MODEL STUDY OF TWO DIMENSION FLOW GENERATED BY A DAM BREAK", "Abstrak": "Dam break is one of a potential collateral hazard of an earthquake. It could generate a very disastrous flow for any infrastructures in its downstream area. This paper discusses a two dimension flow generated by a dam break which flows a building in the downstream of that dam break. Finite difference method is used to simulate that flow. This numerical model result is compared to both experimental work and other numerical model results from previous study. Good comparison of water level and flow pattern is shown between the model results and the experimental work but significant differences of velocity magnitude near the front line of the building are found due to the boundary condition problem.", "Daftar File": {"2008 GL PP M.
