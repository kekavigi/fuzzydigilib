{"Nomor": 595, "Judul": "MELANGE AND BROKEN FORMATION ON THE ROAD FROM BAUCAU TO MANATUTO,TIMOR LESTE", "Abstrak": "Detail geological study conducted along the road from Baucau to Manatuto districts Timor Leste \nhas strongly confirmed the presence of melange unit and broken formation in this area. The melange is composed of scaly mudstone matrix containing clasts of crinoidal limestone, pelagic limestone, oolitic limestone, \nradiolarian chert, sandstone, serpentinite, pillow lava and volcanic rocks and in places fragment of mangan. While the broken formation are mainly sediments of the Triassic Aitutu, Permian Maubisse and Atahoc Formations. \nMost of the clasts, except the serpentinite and radiolarian chert same as the units forming the broken formation where they are also known to occur as a coherent unit and mappble on 1:250 000 scale in the central range of Timor Leste. The serpentinite, radiolarian chert and possibly some pillow lavas interpreted to be derived from the Flores Sea Basin to the north. Based on the regional tectonic of Timor Leste, the melange \nand broken formation may be formed during collision event between Australian Continent and Banda Arc in Pliocene.", "Daftar File": {"BHAKTI H.HARAHAP": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/854"}, "Penulis": "BHAKTI H.HARAHAP", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": [], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "strongly confirmed, places fragment of mangan, during collision.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Agu 2004"}
