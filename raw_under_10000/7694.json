{"Nomor": 7694, "Judul": "LAMBUSANGO FOREST CONSERVATION PROJECT, SOUTH EAST SULAWESI, INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "The focus of Lambusango Forest Conservation Project (LFCP) is 65,000 ha of uninhabited lowland evergreen rainforest in the central Buton, South East (S.E.) \n\nSulawesi, Indonesia. This block of forests is popularly known as Lambusango1 Forest. Much of this is intact and none faces the major pressures for forest clearance from oil palm plantations, pulp industry or sawmills that so threaten the forests in the rest of the country. This forest is made up of different categories: 28,510 ha of two protected areas, Kakenauwe Nature Reserve (810 ha2) and Lambusango Wildlife Reserve (28,510 ha3) which are managed by the Natural Resource Conservation Agency (BKSDA4) S.E. Sulawesi on behalf of the central government (Ministry of Forestry), and 35,000 ha of \n\nprotection forest and production forest which are managed by local government, i.e. the Buton District Forestry Office (Dishut Buton).", "Daftar File": {"RepOct05.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/18948"}, "Penulis": "Dr. Edi Purwanto", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["mahmudin@lib.itb.ac.id"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Kliping Elektronik", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Ecotourism Project", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Mahmudin \u00a0\n                                     Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "16 Jun 2008"}
