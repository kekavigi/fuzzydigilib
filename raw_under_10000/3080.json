The basic principle of this apparatus is a measurement of the flexural modulus of elasticity. The apparatus consists of three rollers, two of which are located 1,000 mm apart with their fixed axes are in a straight horizontal line. while the other one is exactly in the middle of the other two with its axis adjustable in vertical direction. The mid roller is to impose certain fixed deflection to a piece of lumber being inserted into the apparatus. The deflected lumber will exert reactions in the rollers' axes. These reactions are measured by load cells located around the bearings supporting the rollers' six axes. The deflection can be varied by changing specifically designed seams as to yield reactions within the specified range for certain lumber dimension. The deflection is measured by LVDT located in the midspan under the bottom side of the lumber. Based on the information of rollers' reactions and the measured deflection as well as the lumber dimensions, the flexural modulus of elasticity can be determined. The measurement is performed on some sections while the lumber translating over the rollers and shall be carried out for both top and bottom sides. Tests performed using a calibrating lumber of 49.5 x 69.3 mm' show low dispersions. A calibrating factor of 0.95 will yield 95% confidence level on the modulus of elasticity. The modulus of rupture of the lumber can be determined based on the flexural modulus of elasticity by methods widely reported in the literature. This apparatus can be used for various lumber dimensions by adjusting the vertical position of the middle roller. The lumber dimensions of 20 x 200 to 80 x 200 mm2 can be rated by this apparatus. Since the apparatus is relatively simple, the source of errors can be well identified and controlled to achieve good reproducibility. The economy of the apparatus is resulted from its simplicity and thereby its widespread use in conjunction with construction industry is anticipated. The method and the apparatus have been patented in General Directorate of Intellectual Property Rights, Department of Law and Legislation Republic of Indonesia.", "Daftar File": {"2001_TS_PP_KURNIAWAN_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/3484"}, "Penulis": "IRWAN KURNIAWAN", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Sindur P. mangkoesoebroto"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Sipil", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Sipil dan Lingkungan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "constructed, modulus of elasticity, bearing", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Feb 2005"}
