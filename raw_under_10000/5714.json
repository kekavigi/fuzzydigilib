The study used the 1996 National Socio-Economic Survey (SUSENAS)  \n \n \n\ndata collected by the Central Bureau of Statistics (Biro Pusat Statistik). Descriptive  \n \n \n\nmethod is used for studying consumption pattern and Linear Approximation Almost Ideal  \n \n \n\nDemand System (LA/AIDS) is used for analyzing food demand. Result of the study show  \n \n \n\nas follows : (1) rice is dominant in structure of household budget, energy contribution and  \n \n \n\nhousehold protein in ERI; (2) in some provinces of ERI, there was shifting in consumption  \n \n \n\npattern of staple food from non-rice to rice between 1976 and 1996; (3) consumption of  \n \n \n\nfood as source of carbohydrate in rural areas is higher than in urban areas, but it was  \n \n \n\nvice versa for the consumption of food as protein sources; (4) the higher income of  \n \n \n\nhousehold, the higher food consumption; (5) food demands of household in rural areas  \n \n \n\nwas more responsive to price and income changes than the household in urban areas,  \n \n \n\nand households with the higher income were less responsive to the price and income  \n \n \n\nchanges; and (6) variable of number of household member and education level of head of  \n \n \n\nhousehold influenced significantly to food demand of household in RI. Implication of the  \n \n \n\nstudy are: (1) it is necessary to develop and promote non-rice main food that is suitable  \n \n \n\nto local potentials; (2) policies of food and nutrition in ERI should be prioritized to the  \n \n \n\nhousehold with lower income in rural areas; (3) to satisfy consumption level of energy  \n \n \n\nand protein is needed to increase about 2% income of households with lower income in  \n \n \n\nrural areas; and (4) socialization of education and extension of food and nutrition are still  \n \n \n\nvery important carried out in ERI.", "Daftar File": {"ANALISIS PERMINTAAN PANGAN DI KAWASAN-upld.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/7222"}, "Penulis": "Handewi P.S.
