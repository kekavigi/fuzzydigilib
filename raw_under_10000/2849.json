{"Nomor": 2849, "Judul": "ANALISIS KESTABILAN FLUTTER JEMBATAN CABLE-STAYED", "Abstrak": "A finite element formulation and solution procedure are developed to analyze a linear fluttering cable-stayed bridge in steady potential flows. The governing linear equation of motion are derived from the minimum potential energy principle in which all forces are presented in term of transverse bending displacement and rotation of the deck plate. The structural stiffness, geometrical stress and mass matrices are formulated using beam and cable elements. The aerodynamic forces at the deck plate are computed based on the formulation presented by Scanlan and Tomko. An iterative linearized approach is employed for the solution of the linear flutter equation. The deck plate stability behavior are analyzed from the response parameter of the complex eigensolutions. Effects of structural damping ratio, geometry and dimension of bridge deck are investigated.", "Daftar File": {"1995_TS_PP_SUPRIYADI_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/3233"}, "Penulis": "Agus Supriyadi", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: I Wayan Tjatra"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Sipil", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Sipil dan Lingkungan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Linear fluttering, cable-stayed bridge, transverse bending displacement, rotation of the deck plate.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Feb 2005"}
