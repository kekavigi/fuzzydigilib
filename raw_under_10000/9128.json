{"Nomor": 9128, "Judul": "PRELIMINARY STUDIES OF THERMAL WAVELENGTH APPROXIMATION IN 208 PB AND 91 ZR HOT NUCLEI", "Abstrak": "Level density parameters of 208 Pb and 91 Zr in equilibrium states have been calculated with a new fugacity approximation namely a thermal wavelength approximation. In this approximation, the fugacity is directly proportional to the nucleon density. In contrast with the constant fugacity, the thermal wavelength approximation gives a simpler way to calculate the nuclei constant radius and the density profile. The calculated 208Pb nuclear density is about 0.17 (fm 3) in which the discrepancy is 0.1% higher than the experimental one. The level density parameters are 14% higher than the experimental results due to neglecting of the shell correction", "Daftar File": {"Proceedings ITB Science and Technology  Vol 38 B No 1 2006  p 29-36.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/28994"}, "Penulis": "R.
