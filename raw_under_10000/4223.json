{"Nomor": 4223, "Judul": "EXPLORATION ECONOMICS OF PRIMARY GOLD WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "ABSTRACT:Financing exploration for primary gold has always been a problem in the past, present, and at least in the near future. This is mainly due the non-continuity of the deposit, the low level gold to be detected in the samples (ppb range), the very low success ratio (0.5% - 4%) and the fluctuating price of gold. Gold prices become a barometer for exploration after the \"Bretton-Wood\" was abolished in 1971.", "Daftar File": {"1998_JR_PP_ONG1_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/5162"}, "Penulis": "HL.
