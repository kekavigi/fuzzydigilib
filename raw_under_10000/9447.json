{"Nomor": 9447, "Judul": "ENVIRONMENTAL EMISSIONS MITIGATION SCENARIOS IN TRANSPORT", "Abstrak": "To cope with the problems of growing emissions from transport sector in Jakarta and Bandung, it is mainly considered to assess various policies by offering some options, particularly technical options. The options selected for both cities comprise 3 (three) major parts, i.e. introducing alternative fuels (LPG, CNG, biodiesel, bioethanol), developing technological improvement of existing vehicles (catalytic converter), and optimizing mode shift from low occupancy into high occupancy vehicles (public bus and MRT). To develop mitigation scenarios integrating multiple mitigation options resulting in maximum emission reduction at minimum cost could be achieved by performing cost optimization of available mitigation options, namely least-cost method. The output of the optimization exercise includes minimum total transport cost, vehicular mix, and CO2 emission. Upon comparison of results of baseline scenario and mitigation scenario, Marginal Abatement Cost (MAC) was then \n\ndetermined.", "Daftar File": {"P_3_13.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/31451"}, "Penulis": "Tatang H.
