The attention was focused on coincident failures and severity scenario Pump 15-P-101 chosen as case, this pump is a vital component of RCC (Residue Catalytic Cracker) Unit in Pertamina UP-VI, Balongan. Vibration is the one of four monitored variable to maintain this pump perfornancc. Principally, vibration monitoring of this pump guided with ISO-2372 Standard. The results of this modeling and reliability calculation shows us that accommodation of coincident failures and severity scenario, give a significant influence for the system reliability level. Communication  management approach in operating industrial system are suggested at the last part of this paper (illustrated by RCC Unit) in order to get a reliable maintenance system. Because, operation and maintenance aspect has become an influential factor to determine the system reliability. Especially in repairable system, like wide found in industrial application.", "Daftar File": {"mjl.kalkulasi-kehandalan.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/985"}, "Penulis": "Yu-i Sukriana", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing I: Sonny YuliarPembimbing II:  Togar M.P.
