Knowledge about those sub-km sized asteroids as outcomes of collisional processes has been increased significantly from several continuous and dedicated survey observations. We present the spin and shape distributions of snia.il (sizes < 2 km) main-belt asteroids (MBAs) obtained from our lightcurve observation using the Subaru telescope. The observation was made using the wide-field camera (Suprime-Carr) near opposition and the ecliptic down to a limiting magnitude of I? = 24.6 map,. We found 73 asteroids show reliable spin periods. and 34 asteroids among them are fast-rotator candidates (spin periods < 2.2 ii) whose shapes tend to be spherical.", "Daftar File": {"2005 DERMAWAN": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/5183"}, "Penulis": "Darmawan", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["-"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "Astronomi", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Astronomy", "Kata Kunci": "solar system: minor plant, astero Mchn es: pliotoinetr", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "08 Mei 2006"}
