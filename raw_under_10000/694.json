{"Nomor": 694, "Judul": "THE USE OF MAN MACHINE INTERFACE (MMI)  IN THE TROUBLESHOOTING OF THE PROCESS CONTROL  SYSTEMS OF ELECTRIC FURNACE I AT PT INCO INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "Tile use of Man Machine Interfaces (MMI) as part of the process control systems of Electric Furnace I at PT INCO Indonesia has been broadened from control and monitoring by Operations to include troubleshooting by the Maintenance Group. The duration of  bleshooting, especially the time associated with I/O signals, has been dramatically decreased from 30-40 minutes to 5-10 minutes. The Electric Furnaces at PT INCO are the heart of the process plant. PLC and MMI automation have  \nbeen in use for over six years, improving the control performance and equipment monitoring. This applies not only the process control systems and instrumentation but also the electrical and mechanical systems.  \nThe entire system requires the significant contribution from the MMI that interfaces the PLC systems and the operators in making the troubleshooting much easier and faster.  \nThis paper will describe the general PLC systems of Electric Furnace 1 and the redesign of the MMI  \ndisplays led by the troubleshooting-related problems.", "Daftar File": {"Gati Permonosidi": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/954"}, "Penulis": "Gati Permonosidi", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": [], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Furnace 1, MMI, Troubleshooting", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "26 Agu 2004"}
