{"Nomor": 697, "Judul": "MONITOR JARAK JAUH SISTEM KOMPRESI MELALUI TCP/IP  (ETHERNET) DI FASILITAS MIGAS LEPAS PANTAI  CONOCOPHILLIPS INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "ConocoPhillips Indonesia (COPT) has installed several brands of controllers/devices at Belida & Hang Tuah compression system such as Allen Bradley PLC/SLC, Woodward 511 Fuel Control, CCC Anti Surge Control and Bently Nevada 3300 Vibration and Temperature Monitoring. These controllers can be configured frcm a Wonderware MMI/HMI application via their respective interface systems. The MMI/HMI is located in the local control panel room and capable to captures the data and displays the parameters all of the compression system. It is also connected to Process Control Network (LAN and WAN) to share/publish the data to the COPI intranet and ultimately to the World Wide Web users thru a  \nlocal database servers. These servers are located in every platform. Due to bandwidth limitation in the existing offshore to onshore communications satellite link, only numerical data will be sent if there is a remote users asking the data to be displayed. COPI employees or other users are possible to view all of operating data of the Belida and Hang Tuah compression system through any COPI intranet terminal and/or any external Internet terminal that has Internet browser. This remote monitoring system is already up and running for about 2 years. This system assists COPI to  \nmonitor performance, trouble shoot, optimize, and reduce down time of Belida and Hang Tuah  \ncompression system, and at the end to increase company revenue.
