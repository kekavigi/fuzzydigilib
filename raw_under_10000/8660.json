{"Nomor": 8660, "Judul": "TEKNOLOGI PROSES PENCAMPURAN BIODIESEL : PROSPEK PENGEMBANGAN BIO-FUEL SEBAGAI SUBSTITUSI BAHAN BAKAR MINYAK", "Abstrak": "In the frame of bio diesel is commercialization for industry and transportation, quality of biodiesel is standardized . One important criterion for for the Bio diesel quality is a good mixing between bio diesel and diesel oil. Due to different location of several biodiesel plants, biodiesel consumers and biodiesel \n\nfilling stations, bio diesel  diesel oil mixing technologies should be selected to ensure optimal bio diesel blend can be achieved economically and technically. \n\nThe selected blending technologies should be fitted for application in diesel oil distribution depo, diesel oil filling station storage tank, and also in the diesel oil \n\nfilling equipment. This section will illustrate several technologies for Bio diesel and Diesel oil blending in particular locations.", "Daftar File": {"biboed.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/25744"}, "Penulis": "M.
