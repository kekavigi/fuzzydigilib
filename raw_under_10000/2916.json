{"Nomor": 2916, "Judul": "ANALISIS ROUTE JALAN YANG OPTIMUM MENGGUNAKAN PROGRAM NETWORK-ARC/INFO (STUDI KASUS: PROPINSI JAWA BARAT)", "Abstrak": "In managing transportation, we need information of the road route that can be displayed quick and up-to-date. In this research, a model to find optimum road route in West Java was created using Arc/Info software. Road map and trip assignment information were used as the source of this research. Apart from that, slope and land status were integrated with road route, for eventual planning of widening the road in the future. The results of the research are as follows : \n1. The optimum route can be displayed dinamically and can inform total distance, time, cost and VCR along the route. \n2. The integration of the optimum road route with slope or with land status is the area and length of each type of slope and land status which goes through this route. This will be beneficial as information in planning for widening roads. \n3. It is not necessary to change the route program when new roads are built and trip assignment data are changed", "Daftar File": {"1997_TS_PP_APRILANA_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/3305"}, "Penulis": "Aprilana", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing I: Jacub Rais", "Pembimbing II: T.
