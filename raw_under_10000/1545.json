Study on carbon active has been carried out intensively. However, only limited studies have been done in the areas of adsorption selectivity for heavy metals, either in mining industries or other industries. Therefore, investigations on the characterization and adsorption selectivity of carbon active of local products are important. The study showed that the adsorption is strongly influenced by particle we, specific surface area and porosity of activated carbon. Furthermore, it was found that the degree of adsorption of each metals is function of solution concentration The adsorption quantity of Cu is higher than Cd which is higher than Cr. In the concentration range of 25 - 200 ppm the adsorption quantities of Cu, Cd and Cr were found 12 - 98 mgr/gr, 7 - 57 mgr/gr, and 7 - 54 mgr/gr respectively. In addition, a similar trend was obtained for the adsorption percentage of Cu was larger than Cd which is larger than Cr. Respectively, there values were 98,97 - 97,85 %, 98,69 - 95,33 %, and 91,41 - 89,75 % for Cu, Cd and Cr. Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherm curves are hale to find adsorption equation which is used to estimate the adsorption quantities (mgr adsorption of metals / gr activated carbon) when equilibrium concentration of effluent is known and inversely. The adsorption capacity of adsorbent for Cr at saturated condition is 204,08 mgr/gr, whereas for Cu is 138,89 mgr/gr, and for Cd is 78, 74 mgr/gr. Although the adsorption capacity at saturated condition for Cr is the highest it needs a longer time to achieve, compared to which for Cu and Cd. The adsorption rate of the adsorbent to achieve the adsorption capacity at saturated condition (value of 0 = 1), are Cd > Cu > Cr respectively. It was found in this study that the adsorption capability of activated carbon in the column process was similar to that in batch process. The adsorption capability of activated carbon for Cu was higher than Cd which was higher than Cr. It was also showed in this study that the adsorption capability of activated carbon in low rate of inffluent was higher than in high rate of inffluent.", "Daftar File": {"1998_TS_PP_SUKAMTO_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/1874"}, "Penulis": "Untung Sukamto", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing I: Arief Sudarsono", "Pembimbing II: Pramusanto", "Scanner: Irwan.
