The basic fundamental of this engine is to maintain stability of the engine rotation speed(rpm) during all cycle of engine operation. To control the rpm, a Fuel Control Unit is installed. This device controls the rpm and also the fuel flow consumption through a fuel injector in the combustion chamber. In the past decade, the pneumatic fuel control unit is starting to be replaced by electronic fuel control unit. An electronic fuel control unit is believed to have better performance compared to pneumatic controllers. In this undergraduate thesis, a simulation of a fuzzy logic based fuel control unit on Allison Bendix 250 engine was done using MATLAB 7.0. From this simulation, it can be observed that the fuzzy logic based fuel control unit was able to stabilize the engine under disturbances. Results of this simulation will be discussed further in later chapter.", "Daftar File": {"2007 TA PP ANISSA RAMANIYA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/7412", "2007 TA PP ANISSA RAMANIYA 1-BAB1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/7413", "2007 TA PP ANISSA RAMANIYA 1-BAB2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/7414", "2007 TA PP ANISSA RAMANIYA 1-BAB3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/7415", "2007 TA PP ANISSA RAMANIYA 1-BAB4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/7416", "2007 TA PP ANISSA RAMANIYA 1-BAB5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/7417", "2007 TA PP ANISSA RAMANIYA 1-BAB6.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/7418", "2007 TA PP ANISSA RAMANIYA 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/7419"}, "Penulis": "Anissa Ramaniya (NIM 102 03 036)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Suprijadi, Dr.M.Eng    \n \n \n \n\nScanner : Novian Kurniawan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Gas Turbine Engine, Allison Bendix 250, Fuzzy Logic, Fuel Control Unit, RPM, Fuel Flow.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ena Sukmana", "File": "8 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
