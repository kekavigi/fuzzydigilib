Many computers and devices have been attached to the IP network and many applications were taken place over it. One of interesting applications is building embedded control system which has connectivity to Internet. This paper explains an implementation of embedded web server with security support which becomes an example of control application over IP network. A security algorithm, TEA (Tiny Encryption Algorithm), has been implemented in a microprocessor system together with TCP/IP stack. The microprocessor system is based on 8051 family microcontroller which serves as web server. The encryption algorithm is processed both on server and client. Therefore in clients need a plug in, which run encryption mechanism, so that they can access the embedded web server safely.", "Daftar File": {"2004 GL PP CARMADI MACHBUB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/19330"}, "Penulis": "Eka Suwartadi, Candra Gunawan, Ary Setijadi P, Carmadi Machbub", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["#CONTRIBUTOR#"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Literatur Kelabu", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "IP network, microprosessor, security algorithm", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "13 Feb 2008"}
