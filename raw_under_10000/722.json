{"Nomor": 722, "Judul": "DEVICENET APPLICATION FOR REDUCTION KILN FEED  WEIGH-SCALE AT PT. INCO", "Abstrak": "The DeviceNet technology has been applied in the PT Inco Process Plant Department recently. All the weigh-scale integrators mounted on the Reduction Kiln Feed conveyors have been connected to a DeviceNet network. The main objective is to acquire the Kiln Feed data accurately from the integrators.  \nOre and coal are fed to five Reduction Kilns through bins and conveyors. The bins and conveyors are equipped with weigh scales to measure the amount of the ore and coal fed to the Kilns. The accurate measurement of the Kiln feeds is essential to validate the mass balance calculation of the Kilns and also at each step of the subsequent production chains.  \nThis paper presents the comparison of data obtained by the integrator through the DeviceNet system and analog signals.", "Daftar File": {"Wisnu Narvoko": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/983"}, "Penulis": "Wisnu Narvoko", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": [], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "DeviceNet, Reduction Kiln, integrator, comparison.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Agu 2004"}
