{"Nomor": 630, "Judul": "THE INFLUENCE OF HYDROGEOLOGICAL FACTORS ON VARIATIONS OF VOLCANIC SPRING DISTRIBUTION, SPRING DISCHARGE, AND GROUNDWATER FLOW PATTERN", "Abstrak": "This study has been conducted on east slope of Mt. Ciremai, a strato-type volcano with elevation \nof 3072 masl, in Kabupaten Kuningan, West Java, Indonesia. Result of 20 observations had shown that spring discharge varies from 10 1/sec to 400 l/sec, consisted of deviated and isolated groundwater flow patterns. Analysis on available data and facts also indicates that there \nare three hydrogeological factors which influence the variations of spring distribution, spring discharge and groundwater flow pattern: distribution of lithology and morphology; intensity of macro fracture; thickness and final infiltration rate of residual soil. The first factor, the change of rock distribution forms slope break at elevation range of 500 - 650 masl, slope angle changes from 19 \u00c2\u00b0 to 4\u00c2\u00b0 . The change of slope angle controls the hydraulic of unconfined groundwater to develops the largest spring distribution at Zone 2 (500 - 650 masl). The elevation range of 100 - 1250 masl \nis discharge area, while the elevation range of 1250 - 3100 masl is recharge area. In detailed scale, volcanic deposit distribution forms morphological feature of ridges and valleys which controls the groundwater flow pattern. The second factor, fracture zone controls the level of spring discharge in volcanic terrain. The fracture system occurs on Laharic Breccia, the fractures stretch consecutively to rock distribution, which also controls the isolated groundwater flow; on Lava flow. The fractures are in form of cooling joints with unsystematic \npattern, which controls the deviated groundwater water flow. The third factor, the weathering processes in the study area is very intensive, resulting in thick residual soil and high final infiltration rate, which is very potential to store and to be infiltrated by rain water and surface water.", "Daftar File": {"DENY JUANDA PURADIMAJA, D.
