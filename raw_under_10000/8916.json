Both are believed to have significant influence on performance. This study is conducted to analyze the effect of job satisfaction and organizational commitment on performance, by developing and testing two models. Structural Equation Modeling is applied to develop theoretical model and analyze data. Data is collected using survey questionnaires, which are distributed to professional staffs of consulting organizations located in East Java. This study concludes that job satisfaction has stronger direct influence on performance than organizational commitment. In fact, that influence is stronger than any other relationship in the tested models. Organizational commitment has negative insignificant direct influence on performance. This relationship is stronger when job satisfaction intervenes in between. On the contrary for the first model, when organizational commitment intervenes in between job satisfaction and performance, the relationship weakened. Because there is no difference on the AIC index value, the better model can not be determined.", "Daftar File": {"7-pauline-sawitri-ok.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/27548"}, "Penulis": "Pauline Sawitri, Rianto B.
