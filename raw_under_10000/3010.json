{"Nomor": 3010, "Judul": "LABORATORY PERFORMANCE OF KALI KRASAK AND KALI PROGO AGGREGATES IN ASPHALT CONCRETE MIX", "Abstrak": "One alternative for decreasing road construction costs is to use local materials obtained close to the project location. For determining whether these local materials can be used as a road pavement material, laboratory tests are needed. This thesis describes an investigation of local materials obtained from Kali Krasak, Kali Progo and Clereng in Yogyakarta. Aggregate from Clereng is known to meet Bina Marga specifications, is widely used and was included in the investigation as the 'control' aggregate. The laboratory programme included tests of aggregate properties, Marshall characteristics, Retained Stability Index and resistance to permanent deformation. Tests on the aggregates show that some properties meet the criteria established by Directorate General of Highway Department of Public Work, SNI.No.1737-1989-F. However other criteria are not met by all aggregates especially resistance to abrasion. The results from the Marshall Test for all asphalt concrete mixes indicate that Marshall characteristics, i.e. stability, voids in mix (VIM), voids in mineral aggregate (VMA), voids filled with bitumen (NUT), flow and Marshall quotient for the range of acceptable bitumen contents meet the specification. The highest stability is obtained with the Clereng (CL) asphalt concrete mix (1289.5 kg), and the lowest with the Kali Krasak (KK) asphalt concrete mix {988.48 kg). The results of the Marshall Immersion test show that Retained Stability Index for all mixes is greater than 75%. Thus, all of the materials meet the specified criterion. Retained Stability Index for Clereng (CL) asphalt concrete mix is the highest(90.57%) and the lowest is for Kali Krasak asphalt concrete mix(83.33%). Wheel Tracking Test results indicate that Kali Krasak (KK) asphalt concrete mix has the highest resistance to permanent deformation (7.21 mm), and the lowest is Kali Progo (KP) asphalt concrete mix (11.49 mm). In no case is permanent deformation greater than 20 mm.", "Daftar File": {"1999 MARJOHAN": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/3409"}, "Penulis": "MARJOHAN [26996013]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Supervisor: Bambang Sugeng Subagio", "Supervisor: Sri Hendarto"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Sistem dan Teknik Jalan Raya", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Sipil dan Lingkungan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Road construction, use local materials, Retained Stability Index.", "Sumber": "FTSL", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Mar 2005"}
