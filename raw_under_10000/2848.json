{"Nomor": 2848, "Judul": "ANALISIS DISTRIBUSI TEGANGAN DI DAERAH ANGKUR PADA BETON PRA-TEGANG SISTEM PASCA-TARIK DENGAN METODA ELEMEN HINGGA", "Abstrak": "This thesis describes stresses occuring in anchor zone or end-block of rectangular pre-stressed concrete with post-tensioned system caused by pre-stress force, both concentrically and eccentrically. One of the alternatives used to analyse the stresses is Finite Element Method. In this study, Hexahedron Isoparametric Element with Eight Nodals method was used, and for its applications, a computer program using FORTRAN-77 language was employed. The results of computation made by the author were compared to the results obtained by several other authors who had studied distribution of stresses within the anchor zone using empirical equations or theoretical solution based on theory of two-dimwnsion or three-dimension elasticity.", "Daftar File": {"1990  TONI UTINA": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/3231"}, "Penulis": "TONI UTINA [818717]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Ridwan Suhud"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Sipil", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Sipil dan Lingkungan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Stresses occuring in anchor zone or end-block, post-tensioned system, concentrically and eccentrically.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Feb 2005"}
