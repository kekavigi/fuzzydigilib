{"Nomor": 4401, "Judul": "IDENTIFICATION OF SP56 MRNA ISOFORMS IN RAT TESTIS", "Abstrak": "ABSTRACT: Sp56is a species-specific gene, which is expressed on sperm and spermatogenic cells in mice. It might be also expressed in species from Family Ruminae, including some rats which are pest for many developing countries, for example rice-field rat, house rat and sewer rat Sp56protein, the product of sp56gene plays an important role in the primary binding of the first step in fertilization with the egg-specific extra cellular matrix, the zona pellucida. Because of its tissue-and species-specific character, the product of this gene is a good candidate to be developed as a reproductive vaccine, which can be used in future for pest control. Sp56gene in rat have some isoform, which are expressed differently on different sexual maturation There are no information about this isoform and where and in which condition this isoform will be expressed. Therefore, the aim of our research is to isolate and characterize the sp56 mRNA isoform and to know in which cells will be each isoform expressed. For this research Rattusnorvegicuswill be used (1-3 months). The expression of each isoform will be observed using RT-PCR. The result showed that sp56 has been expressed in testis immature rat (1,5 month), and might be expressed in spermatocyte. There are two isoform of sp56 which have been expressed since the rat still immature. The similar isoform are also expressed in other species of rat namely sewer rat, rice field rat and house rat. The sewer rat sp56 has the highest homology with sp56from Rattusnorvegicus.", "Daftar File": {"2004_LP_PP_TAN_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/5418"}, "Penulis": "Marselina Irasonia Tan", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["peran: Marselina Irasonia Tan  scan/upload: Dikdik Suhendi (2006-06-12)"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Laporan Penelitian", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "sp56 mRNA ISOFORMS; Rat Testis", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Jun 2006"}
