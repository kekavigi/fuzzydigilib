The numerical model consists of hydrodinamic and convection \u00c2\u2014 dilution transport equations. Hydrodinamic equation is solved by using Duflow program and convection \u00c2\u2014 dilution transport equation was solved by using Central Scheme and Upwind. Hydrodinamic simulation was executed 3 x 24 hours and last 14 hours of simulation results are calibrated to field data. The result show suitability to hydrodinamic mecanism that occurred at field. Sediment transport simulation still show availability small different with field datas, but trend still remain adjusment. The sediment transport simulation was used to know siltation rate in access channel of Barito River.", "Daftar File": {"2002 SYECH FACHIR": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/2623"}, "Penulis": "SYECH FACHIR [20599024]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: M Cahyono"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "Chemistry", "Kata Kunci": "ALUR MUARA SUNGAI BARITO", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Okt 2004"}
