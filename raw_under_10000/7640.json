{"Nomor": 7640, "Judul": "UNCERTAINTY EVALUATION OF DYNAMIC RESERVOIR PARAMETER ON MODERN DECLINE TYPECURVE ANALYSIS", "Abstrak": "Mostly modern decline typecurves analysis were developed using several assumptions such as radial model-cylindrical reservoir with the well in the center of reservoir, constant rock properties-homogeneous reservoir and isotropic, constant fluid properties, and radial composite model for water drive mechanism (edge water system). Unfortunately, in fact, many things did not meet the assumptions such as one of the assumptions is fluid properties, especially oil compressibility. Oil compressibility always changes as the pressure decrease during production, mainly if the pressure decrease below bubble point, there will be significant changes in oil properties. Consequently, that issue which is becoming one of the uncertainties in this method could lead an erroneous result in the analysis and interpretation of modern decline typecurves in reservoir fluid in-place calculation. This paper focuses on evaluating oil compressibility at certain point of pressure which has significantly changes to improve the accuracy of reservoir fluid in place on modern decline typecurves analysis, Blasingame typecurve analysis, using RTATM at certain condition of reservoir (undersatured, saturated, and combination) and certain driving mechanism of reservoir (solution gas drive and bottom-water drive), which had been simulated using CMG(TM).", "Daftar File": {"2008 TA PP DIMAS PERMANA 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/18606"}, "Penulis": "DIMAS PERMANA (NIM 12204029)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. Ir.
