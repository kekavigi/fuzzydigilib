{"Nomor": 4224, "Judul": "EXPLORATION ECONOMICS OF PRIMARY GOLD WITH  SPECIAL REFERENCE TO INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "Abstrak:   Financing exploration for primary gold has always been a problem in the past, present, and at   least in the near future. This is mainly due the non-continuity of the deposit, the low level gold to be detected   in the samples (ppb range), the very low success ratio (0.5% - 4%) and the fluctuating price of gold. Gold   prices become a barometer for exploration after the \"Bretton-Wood\" was abolished in 1971.", "Daftar File": {"1998 H.L. Ong": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/5163"}, "Penulis": "H.L.
