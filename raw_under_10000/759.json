{"Nomor": 759, "Judul": "EVALUASI SISTEM KONTROL KECEPATAN MOTOR DC  BRUSHLESS BERBASIS PEMROSES SINYAL DIGITAL (DSP)", "Abstrak": "In this paper, the speed control strategy is implemented using dedicated digital signal processing TMS320LF2407 (MSK2407 module) for motor control. This DSP is combined with its corresponding power module operated as brushless do motor driver. The motor drive mechanism is generated from 6 drive step switches that are controlled by hall sensors. The inner loop consists of current generating torque subsystem that reads the motor three phase currents that are converted to their corresponding  \nvoltages by the DSP. These voltages are compared to their reference voltages before processed  \nfurthermore in the current controller subsystem. The output of the current controller is fed to the PWM based power module that drives the motor according to the speed setpoint. The speed controller subsystem is constructed as the outer loop of the system where the speed feedback signal is calculated from the motor encoder. The speed controller output is used as the setpoint of current controller. The speed control systems is tested using Pittman brushless DC motor, 3 fasa, 19,1 V, and 1,16 A. In this case, Proportional + Integral algorithm is used. The speed control performance is also evaluated with the influence of load change. Loading is assorted in some setpoints, such as step, ramp up and ramp down.", "Daftar File": {"Edi Leksono": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/1023"}, "Penulis": "Edi Leksono", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Thomas David'"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Teknik Fisika", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknologi Industri", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "the speed control strategy,for motor control,These voltages", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "10 Agu 2004"}
