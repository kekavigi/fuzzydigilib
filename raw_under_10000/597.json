One of the \nproxies for determining SST is 8'80 from foraminifer's shell. An accurate and precise assessment of SST requires establishing calibration for specific species in a specific region. To achieve this goal, I collect a secondary data set of 5 180 from Globigerinoides ruber and G. sacculifer i n the core top from tropical Pacific area. Local salinity effect was calculated based on annual Global Seawater Oxygen -18 Database (G.A.Smidtdt, G.R. Bigg and E.J. Rohlingn, 1994). Corrected 8'80 than calibrated to SST obtained from Levitus  \n(1994) using polynomial regressions and least squared regression technique. Both methods showing almost similar result, but extrapolation quadratic and linear equation bellow temperature around 23 \u00c2\u00b0C indicates that there will be a discrepancy and it's become greater when extended into lower temperature. The standard deviation for Gloiberinoides sacculifer both linear and quadratic is almost the same, which is \u00c2\u00b10.88 \u00c2\u00b0C and \u00c2\u00b10.91 \u00c2\u00b0C, respectively. For Globigerinoides ruber is \u00c2\u00b11.32\u00c2\u00b0C and \u00c2\u00b11.31 \u00c2\u00b0C, respectively. Previous equation are derived from calibration using different species or same species but cultured or different geographic location,and most of them predict lower temperature than SST observed. As consequently there is no general equation can be applied. This discrepancy possibly due to, first, calcification temperature of each species is occurred in different water depth and influence by geographic (different 8180 Water). Second, possibly some planktonic secrete their test in isotopic disequilibrium with 8 180 Ware, and third, due to photosynthetic activity of algal  \nsymbionts and carbonate ion concentration of seawater.", "Daftar File": {"KHOIRIL ANWAR MARYUNANI": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/856"}, "Penulis": "KHOIRIL ANWAR MARYUNANI", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": [], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Teknik Geologi", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Ilmu dan Teknologi Kebumian", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "paleoclimate study.;polynomial regressions;  concentration of seawater.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Agu 2004"}
