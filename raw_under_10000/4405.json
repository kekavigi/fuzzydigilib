We describe herein the extraction, fractination as well as their antiplatelet  aggregating and fibrinolytic activity of crude extract (earlier fractions). Further, It is  following byfractioning using column chromatography completed methods. Ethanol  extract of neem separated by direct extraction and divided into polar, non polar and  semi polar fraction with organic solvent. These fractions are tested pharmacologically  as fibrinolytic agent. Fibrinolytic activity is tested by in vitro test, using  medium containing active fraction, comparator (heparin), blanko (physiologic NaCI).  Blood is dropped into this medium, and fibrinolytic activity is identified when no  coagulation exists. The result of the test in vitro indicate that fibrinolytic activity is  possible for non polar extract of Neems (n-hexane) and it is possible to assume that  polar fraction (ethanol) have no fibrinolytic effect. The result of pharmacological test  for crude extract and crude fractionation has been reported.", "Daftar File": {"2004_LP_PP_SUGARLINI_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/5422"}, "Penulis": "Sugarlini", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Peran: Sugarlini  Scan/upload: Dikdik Suhendi (2006-06-12)"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Laporan Penelitian", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Azadirata indica leaves; Fibrinolytic Agent", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Jun 2006"}
