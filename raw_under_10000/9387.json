The results are intended to give better knowledge on the flutter characteristics of turbomachine bladings necessary for safe designs and operations. In this regard, the effects of the most essential design parameters on the flutter occurence should be investigated. Those parameters are :\n(a)\tThe cascade geometry, i.e. the stagger angle, pitch to chord ratio, and angle of attack.\n(b)\tThe elastomechanic parameters, e.i. the position of rotation (or elastic) axis, natural frequency ratio, mass ratio, and structural damping.\n(c)\tThe unsteady aerodynamic parameters, e.i. the reduced frequency, and interblade phase angle.\nFlutter behavior in the coupled two degree of freedom motions in bending and pitching as well as possible occurence of instabilities in the uncoupled one degree of\nfreedom modes are the main interest.Such a systematic\nstudy to reveal the influences of those\tparameters\nmentioned above has never been done before for cascades.\nThe development of aerodynamic load computation method is started from Martensens theory (12] for the steady condition followed by Carstens approaches (4,5] to formulate the unsteady solution. In this regard, the\nanalysis is based on the following assumptions. The two dimensional cascade consists of a straight row of infinite number of identical blades. The blades are profiled with finite camber and thickness. They are arranged parallel to one another with constant distances in staggered position. Each of the blades are assumed to be supported elastically to enable independent oscillations in a purely vertical translation (bending) and rotation(torsion) about the elastic axis of the blade.During vibration, the phase angle\tdifference between the adjacent blades are assumed to be identical for the entire cascade. As the blades oscillate, the flow around the profiles fluctuates as well. However, the amplitudes of oscillations are assumed to be small that the flow never separates from the profile wall.\nThe treatment of the flow problem to solve the unsteady aerodynamic forces is based on the conservation form of vorticity transport equation, where the singularity method is applied to obtain numerical solutions. Here, the blade surfaces are replaced by vortex layers. As the blades oscillate, the circulation around each of them changes periodically. This in turn creates counter directional vortices at the trailing edges which are convected down stream along the wake by the outlet flow.\nThe mathematical formulation of the aeroelastic stability problem is based on the Lagranges equations of motion. It involves the elastomechanic (inertial, elastic, and friction) and aerodynamic forces inducing two degree of freedom motion in the translation and rotational modes. To obtain the flutter characteristics, it is sufficient to solve the stability boundaries where the motions are in\nthe neutrally stable conditions. In this case the oscillations can be assummed as purely time harmonic. Linearization of the problem is based on the assumption that the amplitudes of the vibrations are small.\nIn order to verify the analysis, isolated flat plate flutter is simulated with the cascade method by introducing flat plate profile with large interblade distances. Comparissons with analytic solution as well as Theodorsens results 15 show sufficienly good agreements.\nThe results of the computations made show in general that each parameter considered plays a certain role in the aeroelastic behavior of the cascade. Qualitatively their individual effects in the two degree of freedom flutter strongly influences the flutter characteristic of the cascade ; highly cambered and thick profiles tend to be more succeptible to flutter. In the two degree of freedom motion, the natural frequency ratio which is a measure of relative stiffnes in bending and torsion, apparently determine the critical velocity and can be taken as a controling variable in the structural design of the blade. The location of elastic axis relative to the center of mass clearly effects the stability. For common turbomachine blades where the frequency ratios are small, positioning the elastic axis behind the profile center.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Sularso", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing 1: Oetarjo Diran, Prof, Ir. \nPembimbing 2: H.W.
