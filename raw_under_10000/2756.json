{"Nomor": 2756, "Judul": "AGGREGATES FOR HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION FROM UNWEATHERED AND PARTIALLY WEATHERED SOURCES", "Abstrak": "The physical and mechanical properties of a wide range of quality of aggregates as prepared from sources found around Bandung, West Java, were examined with a view to assessing their likely performance when used in bituminous pavement surfacings, where the bulk of the mix is comprised of graded aggregates. Materials which were of basic igneous origin, were taken from both bedrock and alluvial sources and represented a wide range of weathering grades. The materials were designated according to a colour coding. The laboratory programme on physical and mechanical properties involved testing for the Aggregate Impact (AIV) and Los Angeles Abrasion Value. In the former test repeated soaking and drying cycles were applied, according to British Standard procedure, prior to loading. This was an attempt to simulate weathering effects, but the limited cycle times applied were found to be insufficient to show any changes due to simulated accelerated weathering, and magnesium sulphate soundness tests would be required to examine this further. A modified impact value (AIVM) was also determined and a residual (AIVR) calculated. It was found that the procedure used in the Institute of Road Engineering was not standard. The second part of the programme involved preparation of bituminous mixes using the aggregates from the different sources. The mixes were gap graded at the no. 16 sieve size. Portland Cement was used as a filler and the bitumen was of 80-100 pen grade as readily found in Indonesia. Testing of the mixes was carried out using Marshall procedures. The results of the materials and Marshall tests indicated that all the qualities of stone could pass adequately normal designated specification standards, except that the flow values in the Marshall tests were usually a little high, in line with the high contents of bitumen required in the mixes. A significant percentage of the bitumen was absorbed in the aggregate, the amount varying from 0.8 % to 2.4 X, in accordance with the degree of weathering of the aggregate.", "Daftar File": {"1990 SELAMAT RASIDI": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/3131"}, "Penulis": "SELAMAT RASIDI [888714]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Supervisor: J.S.Younger", "Cosupervisor: Sri Hendarto"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "The physical and mechanical properties, the bulk of the mix, Angeles Abrasion Value.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Feb 2005"}
