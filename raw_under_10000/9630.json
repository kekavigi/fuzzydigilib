It is especially as contemporary transportation planning has to deal with the social, economic, political dynamics, technology development, availability of resources, and pressure for integrating with land use planning and environment planning. With those and other structural changes and lifestyles in society, the public policy maker in transportation sector is facing a difficult question to accommodate those factors.    \n \n \n \n \n\nThe success or failure on transportation planning experiences in the world in solving the complex issues on transportation, make the raise complex questions on who is the actor that should be involved in transportation planning, include institutional link between government, shared governance include private and citizen participation; what goal should be achieved, and how should the justification of government be in the decision making. Particularly, when every country has its own planning mechanism and its mechanism is related to the path dependency and dynamic context.    \n \n \n \n \n\nBased on those, this study explores the experiences of transportation planning mechanisms on three different countries, social, and political contexts, i.e. the Netherlands, United States, and Indonesia. The mechanism is focused on what, who, and how questions which are based on theoretical perspective of de Roo (2004) diagram to understand the planning and policy position of each country. In addition, the reason, the context or the why question in every comparative country is tried to be revealed. It is used for giving more comprehensive view on those empirical cases in each country from time to time. To this point, theoretical aspects from Banister (2002) and Kusbiantoro (2005), and others, are used for theoretical perspective and analysis of the experiences of transportation planning mechanism.    \n \n \n \n \n\nThrough comprising its planning practices in different geographical and planning culture, it is hoped that it can find the lesson learns as a new challenge for transportation planning for the future. The conclusion of this study shows that every country has differences due to their contexts and social dynamics over time and place as well as global trends on transportation planning mechanism such as todays emphasize more on sustainability way, more share governance and more on accommodating the society need and private participation. Based on those points, it is recommended that transportation planning mechanism should accommodate social, economic and political dynamics, and adapt contemporary issues, technology development and availability of resources including energy resources. It also has to be integrated with environmental and land use planning. Also, transportation planning mechanism should accommodate both citizen and private involvement adequately, but at the same time, transportation planning mechanism should also maintain its technical adjustment. It seems that regionalization of transportation planning is the recent trend.", "Daftar File": {"2006 TS PP WIS MELLI 1- COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/32798", "2006 TS PP WIS MELLI 1- BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/32799", "2006 TS PP WIS MELLI 1- BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/32800", "2006 TS PP WIS MELLI 1- BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/32801", "2006 TS PP WIS MELLI 1- BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/32802", "2006 TS PP WIS MELLI 1- BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/32803", "2006 TS PP WIS MELLI 1- BAB 6.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/32804", "2006 TS PP WIS MELLI 1- BAB 7.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/32805", "2006 TS PP WIS MELLI 1- BAB 8.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/32806", "2006 TS PP WIS MELLI 1- PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/32807"}, "Penulis": "Wis Melli ITB: 25403024", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing 1  :  Mirjan E.
