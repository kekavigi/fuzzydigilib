{"Nomor": 2911, "Judul": "ANALISIS DAN UJI LABORATORIUM DAR, RIWAYAT WAKTU GAYA PADA PONDASI TENSION LEG PLATFORM (TLP)", "Abstrak": "The scale model experiment was done to find the displacement respons of surge, heave and pitch change direction as well as tether force to tension leg platform (TLP) model as the result of regular wave. The model used is square TLP with four cables as binding fast. The wave channel used is a flume with wave have maker generator and completed by wave probe. This model is completed with 4 sensors of accelerentum 4 strain gouges. Conducting this experiment, regular and irreguler waves are used ini various frequency ang height of waves. Frequency used in regular waves are 1.92 Hz, 1.56 Hz, 1.15 Hz, 0.79 Hz with height of waves 0.013 m, 0.02 m, 0.040 m and irregular frequencies are 0.24 Hz, 0.15 Hz, 0.56 Hz, 1.26 Hz, 1.04 Hz, 1.35 Hz with height of waves are 0.03 m, 0.048 m, 0,034 m, 0.024 m, 0.01 m. This model results the displacements of surge, heave and pitch as well as cable strain and then transformed into tension. This result then compared to Tan Gie and WC De Boom, in strain transfer function, displacements in direction of surge, heave and pitch and Mathew intability from this research, the maximum tether force is lower than pretension force. In the regular wave in frequency of 1,92 Hz with height of waves 0.013 m, 0,02 m, and 0,026 m and frequency of 1,52 H, and height of waves 0,026 m and 0,013 m found irregular respons. In Mathew Diagram in direction of pitch, heave and surge found stable conditions accept in frequency of 0,79 in surge directions.", "Daftar File": {"1996_TS_PP_WAHJOEDI_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/3300"}, "Penulis": "WAHJOEDI", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Gde Pradnyana Sutha"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Sipil", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Sipil dan Lingkungan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Scale model experiment,  displacement respons of surge, tension leg platform.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Feb 2005"}
