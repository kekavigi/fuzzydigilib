{"Nomor": 7208, "Judul": "DEVELOPMENT OF STEREOSCOPIC PARTICLE IMAGE VELOCIMETRY (PIV) SYSTEM", "Abstrak": "Nowadays, Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system has been developed and implemented extensively in many different areas in any institution throughout the world. The remarkable performance of capturing the image of instantaneous flow field and transforming it into a flow visualization has led many fluid mechanic scientists to understand the complex flow phenomena. Even so, this state of the art system still undergoes some limitations which only capable of recording the projection of 2-D flow displacements inside the plane of the luminous light sheet; though the out-of-plane (3-D) velocity component is neglected. However, these kinds of limitations have been solved by introducing a newer technique, the Stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry system. Generally, the Stereoscopic PIV only added some algorithm and hardware configurations to the previous PIV system in order to fulfill the task to measure and visualize the out-of-plane velocity components. Consequently, a fine calibration system has to be developed to guarantee the whole process to be carried out perfectly.The thesis discusses some fundamental principles of Stereoscopic PIV system, begins with different stereoscopic configurations that have been used, followed by the relative merits of reconstruction methods for recovering the 3-D displacement vectors. Next, a calibration code is developed to correct and minimize the perspective distortion caused by the stereo optical (camera and lens) configuration. In addition, to support the calibration need, to recover, as well as to reconstruct the out-of-plane velocity components, a new hardware configuration has been put in consideration, i.e. a pair of self-developed mounting devices developed to facilitate the Scheimpflug camera-lens configuration. Subsequently, the calibration procedure was noted and illustrated from top to bottom, in order to give a deep perception of how important the procedure is for the whole Stereoscopic PIV system. Finally, experiments followed by the error estimation are conducted to ensure that all systems (hardware and software) could be performed perfectly.By and large, Stereoscopic PIV is a sophisticated, yet a very complex experimental system. However, the greater advantages of its complexity have brought the fluid mechanics world, especially the PIV method itself, into a higher level.", "Daftar File": {"2008 TA PP ANDREY GUNAWAN 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/15467", "2008 TA PP ANDREY GUNAWAN 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/15468", "2008 TA PP ANDREY GUNAWAN 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/15469", "2008 TA PP ANDREY GUNAWAN 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/15470", "2008 TA PP ANDREY GUNAWAN 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/15471", "2008 TA PP ANDREY GUNAWAN 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/15472", "2008 TA PP ANDREY GUNAWAN 1-BAB 6.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/15473", "2008 TA PP ANDREY GUNAWAN 1-PUSTAKA A.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/15474", "2008 TA PP ANDREY GUNAWAN 1-PUSTAKA B.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/15475"}, "Penulis": "ANDREY GUNAWAN (NIM 13602043)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Lavi R.
