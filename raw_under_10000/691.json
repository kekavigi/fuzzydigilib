The design is aimed to increase an alternative industrial bussiness in village society;  marily in margin land that producing cassava only. The machine design includes an induction motor 1 phase, 2hp and an AT 89C51 micro controller. The micro controller is used for distributed control system (DCS) with a variable time control processes of grating, pressing, transporting and drying of th wet tapioca. The experimental results indicated a grating time of 20 minutes/100kg, a pressing time of 5 minutes/(100kg plus 60 liter water), a sedimentation time of 240 minutes and a drying time of 15 minutes at 51 \u00c2\u00b0celsius, yielding to 35 kg tapioca. The results are better compared with the conventional method, yielding to 29 kg tapioca only from 100 kg cassava and in a longer process time.", "Daftar File": {"mjl.-sistem-kontrol-terdistribusi.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/951"}, "Penulis": "Dulhadi", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Scanner:Mudjiono"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Laporan Penelitian", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "time control, micro controller, tapioca", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Jan 2006"}
