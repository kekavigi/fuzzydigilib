{"Nomor": 671, "Judul": "ADSORPTION OF EXTREMELY LOW CONCENTRATION     OF ETHYLENE FROM A CONFINED STORAGE BY     MORDENITE AND DEALUMINATED MORDENITE", "Abstrak": "ABSTRAK: \nMordenite (MOR) \u00c2\u00ab as utilized to remove extremely low concentration ethylene   by adsorption. We found that amount of ethylene adsorbed on mordenite in sodium (NaMOR) form was higher than that in the protonated form. In addition, the adsorption capability onto  NaMOR increased with Si/Al ratio. Compared to alumina and activated charcoal, MOR have  higher ethylene phlilicity (amount of ethylene adsorption), especially Na-type with high Si/AI  ratio. It was also found that NaMOR adsorbed ethylene weakly and easier to regenerate than alumina did.  \nKeywords: Extremely low concentration of eth\\_ lone; Adsorption: Hydrophobicity index.", "Daftar File": {"adsorption2...mj.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/930"}, "Penulis": "Nurak Grisdanurak,", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing I: Takashi AidaScanner:Mujiono"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Extremely low concentration of eth\\\\_ lone; Adsorption: Hydrophobicity index,     ivlordenite", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Jan 2006"}
