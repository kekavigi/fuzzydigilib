{"Nomor": 591, "Judul": "ANTHIHEPATO TOXIC ACTIVITY OF MALPHIGHIA COCCOGERA L. EXTRACT", "Abstrak": "The antihepatotoxic action of Malpighia COCCIGERA Linn. (Bunga Mutiara) leaves has been studied on carbon tetrachloride induced liver injury in three months old albino male Wistar rat weighing about 205 \u00c2\u00b1 35g. has been studied. The results showed that the ageous extract at a dose of 0.625 g/kg of body weight did not influence the rat's sleeping time neither the onset of sleeping time significantly whereas in doses of 1,25 and 2.5g/kg of body weight the effects were significant (P 0.05). Oral administration of carbon tetrachloride in doses of 1,2 and 3 ml/kg of body weight increased the serum transminase activities up to 1236.5 \u00c2\u00b1 675.5 % and the liver weight up to 25 \u00c2\u00b1 9 g. After 72 hours of carbon tetrachloride administration, the doses of 1,25 and 2.5g/kg of body weight decreased significantly (P 0.05) the strum level of transminase, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin respectively.", "Daftar File": {"1995_GL_PP_SUGIARSO": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/850"}, "Penulis": "Nelly C.
