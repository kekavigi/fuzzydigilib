{"Nomor": 7650, "Judul": "EXPLORING REGULATORY FRAMEWORK AND GOVERNANCE OF COMMUNITY-BASED FOREST MANAGEMENT: CASE STUDY OF INDONESIA", "Abstrak": "ABSTRAK:    \n \n \n \n \n\nOver the past thirty years, Indonesian national development priorities have emphasized large-scale natural resource extraction from these areas, particularly timber from natural forests. The hundreds of corporations which have received these rights have enjoyed windfall profits from the rapid mining of timber. This has marginalized the community forestry activities. But major changes occurred in 1990s, the central government started to promote the community forestry. It related to civil society struggle on community forestry development. A vigorous civil society movement has emerged to challenge state control of forests including several broad alliances of NGOs and other civil society elements. Furthermore Decentralization in Indonesia has given opportunity and challenges in developing community-based forest management.    \n \n \n \n \n\nThis research presents the overview of the regulatory framework and governance of community-based forest management in Indonesia. This research is expected to contribute in the development of community forest management system. As it has been known that the success of this approach is variable among national governments, understanding regulatory framework and governance is such a factor that can influence the success of community forest management. Exploring Indonesian legal framework and governance can be used as a lesson learned by other countries in establishing policies on community forest management.    \n \n \n \n \n\nThe result of this research is that in general forestry decentralization in developing community-based forest management in Indonesia has clear limitations, but it has delivered valuable lessons about how the regulatory framework could be improved to deliver sustainable and equitable forest management processes to support the development of livelihood for the country with million forest-dependent people, and how to set land tenure in law and regulation. For groups of NGOs, the lesson learned is to be more effective they need to attend more to the local realities.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Dini Danial Sudrajat (NIM 25405035-RuG S1623249)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Supervisor I: Justin R.
