Only from Sulawesi (Celebes) two other genera, Babyrousa and Celebochoerus has been reported, of which the latter is extinct. The representatives of recent suids in Indonesia are : Sus scrofa, Sus barbatus, Sus verrucosus, Sus celebensis, Babyrousa babyrussa and Sus heureni nov. sp. The validity of three other species, Sus floresianus, Sus timorensis and Sus papuensis, is discussed. The origin, migrations and evolution of the various species of the genus Sus are still poorly known. Up to the present time very little has been published about the recent and fossil suids of Indonesia. One of the purposes of this study is to obtain a better understanding on the phylogeny and paleozoogeography of Suidae, especially those from Java. To achieve this aim it is necessary : 1) to study the re-cent material, especially the morphology of those parts which are also known in fossil taxa (cranium, mandibula and post cranial skeleton).  \n2) to find out what the variation is, of the morphological characters used for the classification, within one species. \nAn attempt is made to find a sample from one level? which can be considered as a sample of one species, or better one population, :f the variation within such an assemblage is known, samples from other localities can be compared to this standard. The recent material studied is stored at the State Museum of Natural History, Leiden; Zoological Museum, University of Amsterdam and Zoology Museum, Bogor, The fossil material is stored at the State Museum of Natural History, Leiden (Dubois Colle,ction); The geological Survey of Indonesia and Bandung Institut of Technology, Bandung; Institute of Earth Science, State University, Utrecht; and at the Senckenberg Museum, Frankfurt, The results of this study are :  \n1) The various species within the genus Sus in Indonesia, fossil as well as recent, are revised. \n2) Material of different geological ages has been \nstudied and. described. The recent species are compared with the fossil species on the basis of the same morphological characters, through which uniformity is achieved in the classification of recent and fossil suids. This classification is the basis on which the phylogeny is reconstructed.  \n3) Two fossil species (Sus brachygnathus and Sus macrognathus), one subspecies (Sus macrognathus terhaari) and two questionable species (Sus stremmi and Sus sangiranensis) are discussed.  \n4) Nine recent species and subspecies are recognized ( Sus barbatus, Sus verrucosus, Sus celebensis, Sus heureni nov. sp., Sus timorensis, Sis scrofa vittatus, Sus scrofa \nmilleri, Sus scrofa floresianus and Sus scrofa papuensis). \n5) A new species of pig from the island of Flores, Sus heureni nov. sp., is described. \n6) The phylogeny, evolution, biostratigraphy and paleozoogeography of the various Tavanese species of the genus Sus are discussed.", "Daftar File": {"1983 Hidajat Sjarief Hardjasasmita": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/1081"}, "Penulis": "Hidajat Sjarief Hardjasasmita", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Promotor : S.
