{"Nomor": 9816, "Judul": "INSTITUTION BUILDING FOR ADAPTIVE RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT (Case study : Brantas and the Rhine River Basin Management)", "Abstrak": "Recently the shift of paradigm in water management has been developed in many countries in the world. The shift refers to the approach changing from command control approach towards more adaptive approach encouraging responsiveness, flexibility and innovations development in the management process. The shift on the water management approach is encouraged by complexity of water system and many uncertainties emerging in management process. An adaptive management is promoted as an approach and methodological innovation providing better insight to deal with the need for more socially constructed in water resource management.Because water management approach need to be changed towards more adaptive so this research want to know how adaptive management concept is brought in the management of river basin. The research is focused to attain better insight how institution is developed for bringing adaptive management concept in river basin management based on the experiences of Brantas and the Rhine RBMs. Based on understanding upon the institution building of both RBMs and the basic theory of the concept of adaptive management, we hope that we can get some lessons to improve the current institutions.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "AGNES ANDRIANI KARTIKA SARI (NIM 25406031)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Dr. Johan Woltjer dan Ir.
