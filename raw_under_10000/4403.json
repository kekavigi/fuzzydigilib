So far, especially in  Indonesia, autoclave and hand-lay up techniques have extensively been used. Both  techniques yield different composite performance'. Autoclave techniques produce  high performance composites for the aircraft structures with very expensive raw  materials, namely pre-impregnation material (called pre-pregs). Hand-lay up techniques  result in low composite performance, where there is a safety problem during  the composite production. Labors are often subjected to chemicals and volatile  compounds during hand-lay up production. As demands for the safety composite  production (ISO 14000) and moderate performance composites, resin infusion has  recently been gained many interests, particularly boating companies. Void due to  the trapped air in fibers can be reduced by using vacuum pump, so that the  composite performance increases, leading to production of moderate  performance composites. As a closed systems, volatile compounds like styrene  are absorbed and then released to a special chamber. Therefore, the resin infusion is more safety and gives better composites performance than the hand-lay up techniques. Raw materials for the infusion method are The research aimed to develop a lab-scale resin infusion machine and to study the process parameters. Random mat and woven fabric composites were produced by using this technique. Afterward, physical properties, and mechanical properties of those composites were measured and examined. After gained experiences within this project, it brought us   to higher steps, namely producing industrial composites. For continuance of this project, we are studying and produce a model fishing boat.", "Daftar File": {"2004_LP_PP_SURATMANI_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/5420"}, "Penulis": "Rochim Suratman\\',", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Peran: Rochim Suratman  Scan Upload: Dikdik Suhendi (2006-06-12)"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Laporan Penelitian", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Woven Fabric Composites Glasspolyster; fiber architecture; namely pre-impregnation material; alled pre-pregs", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Jun 2006"}
