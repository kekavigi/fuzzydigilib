{"Nomor": 8758, "Judul": "IMPROVED PERFORMANCE OF BOLT-CONNECTED LINK DUE TO CYCLIC LOAD", "Abstrak": "Recent development in seismic resistant steel frames was directed to the development of an effective and efficient energy dissipater such as a link in eccentrically braced frames. This research was carried out to study the performance of the shear-type link due to cyclic load, especially to improve the energy dissipation as well as the ductility and the strength of the link itself. Experimental work has been carried out to two specimens of bolt-connected link. Additional side-extended plates were welded at top and bottom flanges of each end of the link to prevent early failure of the link. A cyclic load was applied under displacement control. The results show that the side-extended plate has significantly improved the performance of the link, both in the strength, ductility and energy dissipation.", "Daftar File": {"2008 GL PP MUSLINANG MOESTOPO 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/26444"}, "Penulis": "MUSLINANG MOESTOPO", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Dyah Kusumastuti and Andre Novan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Literatur Kelabu", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "bolt-connected link, cyclic load, seismic resistant steel frame", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Vika Anastasya Kovariansi \u00a0\n                                     Vika Anastasya Kovariansi", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Mei 2008"}
