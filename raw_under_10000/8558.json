The huff-puff process injects steam at fixed rate and known wellhead quality for a short period of time, and the well returned to production after a brief shut-in period. \n \n\nSteam stimulation process is discovered accidentally in Venezuela during production of heavy crude by steamflooding the Mene Grande field near the eastern shore of Lake Maracaibo in 1959. \n \n\nThere are two important reasons to study cyclic steam injection. Firstly, the thermal efficiency of cyclic steam is high, and it is thus attractive. Secondly, cyclic steaming will promote effective reservoir heating and to deplete formation pressure prior to full-scale steamflood. \n \n\nThe performance of such wells may be predicted from empirical correlations, simple analytical models or thermal reservoir simulator. In principles, the reservoir simulator yields the most accurate answer but it is only possible after many different simulations. Further, the reservoir simulator is sensitive to data that are often not known or unreliable. Therefore, it is natural to develop simpler analytical model that account the important mechanism involved in this process, and from which we may draw general conclusions about performance. \n \n\nThe utilization of analytical model to optimize cyclic steam process is presented in this study. To determine the optimum process variables in cyclic steam stimulation in Dun Steamflood (DSF), the analytical model proposed by Aziz and Gontijo is used to investigate the effects of system and operation condition on production responses in order to optimize steam stimulation process. Optimizing will be include determine the optimum amount of heat injected, length of soak period and job scheduling. \n \n\nAn analytical model is easy to understand because the equations are simple, easy to conduct a number of sensitivity runs quickly and can be run on any small desktop computer. For that reason, analytical model in steam stimulation will help Production Engineer in designing and evaluating the steam stimulation operations.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Mathias T.
