{"Nomor": 4244, "Judul": "LARGE SCALE SOLAR MEAN FLOWS   AND TILT MOTION DERIVED FROM INDIVIDUAL SUNSPOT PROPER MOTION", "Abstrak": "Abstract: Base on the measurements of 650 individual sunspot proper motions during period 1989 to 2002 of solar cycle 22 and 23, we study mean motion of solar differential rotation and meridional flow. Solar full-disk of white-light photographs on 35-mm negative films was converted to digital data by utilizing film scanner. The measurement of individual sunspot is focused on umbra position. The linear drift of traced motion is used to determine drift motion of each sunspot. Magnetic polarities of individual sunspot follow the magnetogram. The formula of differential rotation as function of   \nlatitude, B can be written as w(B) = a -I- b sine B, where a = 14.5 + 0.3 and b -2.4 + 0.3. The longitudinal separation drift of different polarity sunspots was about   \n70 m/s, in which preceding sunspot moves about 3% faster than following. The mean latitudinal drift is larger than previously obtained from daily sunspot group. The difference of tilt motion of preceding and following polarities is larger toward equator. Early type sunspot shows a larger difference than well-developed type sunspot.", "Daftar File": {"2005 HERDIWIJAYA": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/5184"}, "Penulis": "D.
