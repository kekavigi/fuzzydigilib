The influence of cromolin, aminophyline and dipenhy-dramine also tested on compound 48/80. The results were found that the ethanolic extinct chlorofunn and ethyl acetate fraction of Elephantopus scaber L could inhibit to most cell degranulation. The chloroform fraction more effective than the ethanolic extract and the other fraction. The doses use 0,250 %; 0,500 % and 1 %.", "Daftar File": {"1995_GL_PP_EVACUASANY_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/881"}, "Penulis": "Endang Evacuasany [-]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["2nd Author: W.M.
