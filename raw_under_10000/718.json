{"Nomor": 718, "Judul": "METODOLOGI FORMAL UNTUK VERIFIKASI SKENARIO  KONTROL INDUSTRIAL BERBASISKAN PETRI NET'", "Abstrak": "Control scenario is the most important element in industrial automation. The scenario could be  \nimplemented using relay and contactor, PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) and DCS (Distributed Control System). There is a big question about the verifiability of control scenario i.e how it could be verified. Verifiability is important so that supervisory control and machine maintenance could be done transparently and accountable.  \nThis paper presents a method for scenario testing based on Petri Net theory. In this method a scenario is represented in Petri Net and tested by using Petri Nets analysis tools i.e Reachability Analysis.  \nThis method used to prove the liveness, boundedness of model and also check for deadlock occurence in the model. The next step is to convert Petri Net representation into diagrams which are relevant to the machine e.g Laddder Logic for PLC or Wiring Diagram for relay and contactor system. Two industrial case is presented to show the frame of work, the first one is Air Compressor 101-J Interlock System and  \nthe second is Electrical Load Shedding system, both work is done in a collaboration with PT. PUSRI  \nPalembang.", "Daftar File": {"S. Yuliar": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/978"}, "Penulis": "S. Yuliar", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["A. M. Tapil0UW2, A. Rahmanu 2 , 1.
