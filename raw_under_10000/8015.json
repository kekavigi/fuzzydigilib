{"Nomor": 8015, "Judul": "FOURTEEN-COLOR PHOTOMETRY OF M13 AND RUPRECHT 8 USING THE DICHROIC-MIRROR CAMERA (DMC)", "Abstrak": "Photometry has been carried out to the globular cluster M13 and open cluster Ruprecht 8 (Ru 8) using the Dichroic-Mirror Camera (DMC). DMC is an instrument developed at the Institute of Astronomy, the University of Tokyo, which has the capability of simultaneous imaging in 15 colors across 390-930 nm. Observation has been carried out in Higashi-Hiroshima Observatory using the 1.5-m Kanata telescope on 7 March 2008. Due to some problem, the observation was done in 14 colors. The raw images obtained during the observation was reduced and measured by employing PSF and aperture photometry. Instrumental magnitudes derived from the measurement were calibrated into standard magnitudes. The resulting photometric sequence was used to generate cluster colormagnitude diagram (CMD) and spectral energy distribution (SED) of its member stars. Theoretical isochrones were then fitted to the data scatter in the CMD. The best-fit isochrones yielded physical parameters of the clusters, i.e. T = 18.0 Gyr, [Fe/H] = \u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u201a\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u20131.67, (m4\u2212M4) = 14.9, E(m4\u2212m11) = 0.0, d = 9.5 kpc for M13 and T = 350\u2212500 Myr, [Fe/H] = \u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u201a\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u20130.76, (m4\u2212M4) = 11.54, E(m4 \u2212 m12) = 1.05, d = 800 pc for Ru 8. These results, however, do not agree perfectly with the references. Future improvements in data analysis and possibly the instrument itself are suggested to refine current results.", "Daftar File": {"2008 TS PP HANINDYO KUNCARAYAKTI 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/21266", "2008 TS PP HANINDYO KUNCARAYAKTI 1-BAB1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/21267", "2008 TS PP HANINDYO KUNCARAYAKTI 1-BAB2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/21268", "2008 TS PP HANINDYO KUNCARAYAKTI 1-BAB3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/21269", "2008 TS PP HANINDYO KUNCARAYAKTI 1-BAB4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/21270", "2008 TS PP HANINDYO KUNCARAYAKTI 1-BAB5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/21271", "2008 TS PP HANINDYO KUNCARAYAKTI 1-BAB6.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/21272", "2008 TS PP HANINDYO KUNCARAYAKTI 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/21273"}, "Penulis": "HANINDYO KUNCARAYAKTI (NIM 20306002)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Dr. Hakim Luthfi Malasan dan Prof. Mamoru Doi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Astronomi", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Fourteen-color photometry, M13, Ruprecht 8, Dichroic-Mirror Camera (DMC)", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Rizki Aprianti \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "8 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
