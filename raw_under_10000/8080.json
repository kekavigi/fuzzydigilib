{"Nomor": 8080, "Judul": "USE OF SEQUENCING BATCH REACTORS FOR THE TREATMENT OF SHRIMP POND WASTEWATER", "Abstrak": "Shrimp aquaculture needs good water quality for growth. However the presence of high concentration of NH3-N, NO3-N, and NO2-N in the shrimp ponds can be toxic to shrimp. Removal of these nitrogen species was accomplished using a SBR. The results were obtained by acclimatization, collecting shrimp wastewater from Lampung and preparing synthetic wastewater with various salinity concentrations, running the SBR process (with the sequence: aerobic, anoxic, aerobic), and analyzing the sample at the initial time of the trial and the end of each step. The objective of this research was to monitor the ammonia, nitrate, and  \n \n\nnitrite concentration during the SBR process that will give information for the optimization. Low concentration (below 10 ppm) of all these nitrogen species were shown by Lampung sample and 99 % removal of these compounds were achieved within 8 days of reactor operation. Nitrite and nitrate accumulation were shown both in synthetic fresh and saline wastewater (10,000 ppm NaCl). Reactor operated for 16 days resulted in 99 % ammonia removal, 80 % NO2-N removal and 99 % NO3-N removal, while for synthetic saline wastewater only ammonia and nitrate that experienced successful removal. The research on shrimp production, hatchery, marketing, and waste management is essential for long term sustainability of shrimp production in Indonesia.", "Daftar File": {"2008 TS PP HENDRAWAN SAPUTRA 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/21752", "2008 TS PP HENDRAWAN SAPUTRA 1-BAB1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/21753", "2008 TS PP HENDRAWAN SAPUTRA 1-BAB2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/21754", "2008 TS PP HENDRAWAN SAPUTRA 1-BAB3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/21755", "2008 TS PP HENDRAWAN SAPUTRA 1-BAB4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/21756", "2008 TS PP HENDRAWAN SAPUTRA 1-BAB5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/21757", "2008 TS PP HENDRAWAN SAPUTRA 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/21758"}, "Penulis": "HENDRAWAN SAPUTRA (NIM 23006010)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing : Prof. Ramaraj Boopathy, Ph.D. dan Prof. Tjandra Setiadi, Ph.D."], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknologi Industri", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Sequencing batch reactors, Aerobic, Anoxic, Shrimp wastewater, Water treatment, Nitrification, Denitrification", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Rizki Aprianti \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "7 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
