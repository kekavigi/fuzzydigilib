{"Nomor": 7010, "Judul": "INELASTIC BEHAVIOR OF DUCTILE BUCKLING-RESTRAINED BRACED TRUSS-GIRDERS MOMENT FRAMES", "Abstrak": "This paper evaluates the inelastic behavior of three Buckling-Restrained Braces (BRB) and a ductile Buckling-Restrained Braced Truss-Girder Moment Frames (BRBTMF) by analytical and experimental means. The BRB section is a strip plate core A283 grade C steel which has been treated with soft annealing, cased with rectangular hollow section A50 steel as a buckling-restraint material. The BRBTMF proposed in this paper is the modification of The Special Truss Moment Frames (STMF) X-diagonal-type by replacing the X-diagonal with the BRB inverted-V-type to improve its inelastic behavior. From the Nonlinear History Analysis using earthquake records, it can be concluded that in general, the BRBTMF has better inelastic behavior than the other ductile frames. The cumulative ductility factor of the BRBTMF subassemblages has met the requirements of the hysteretic system structure. Based on these preliminary studies, the use of the BRBTMF may be implemented to practice.", "Daftar File": {"2008 GL PP ADANG SURAHMAN 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/14091"}, "Penulis": "ADANG SURAHMAN", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["H.
