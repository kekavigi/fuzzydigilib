This method is used to estimate structures response under the influence of strong seismic load based on UBC 1997 and IBC 2003. Regular building with beam-column and flat slab as its system modeled as reinforced concrete moment resisting frames of varying heights (5, 10, 20, and 30 story of each system) are used as a study case. This building is located in third zone with 0.3g of ground motion (UBC 1997) and using Ss = 0.83 and S1 = 0.45 as parameters above soft soil (IBC 2003). After modeling, push-over analysis is used to produce capacity curve. Then, the capacity curve of each system is compared based on seismic code of UBC 1997 and IBC 2003. The intersection of capacity and demand curve represent the performance point of the structure.   \n \n \n \n\nSeveral conclusions have been established according to response of structure such as the displacement of a 5-10 story building shows that flat slab system is still gives a good performance (equal to beam-column system) ; related to ductility, flat slab has a smaller actual ductility against beam-column system. It was caused by the number of plastic hinge occurred in flat slab system were fewer than beam-column system. As a result, dissipation energy process in flat slab system was limited against beam-column system. Another conclusion was, performance level of flat slab system has a same   \n \n \n \n\nlevel as beam-column system, stated Immediate Occupancy (IO). It showed that flat slab system can be used as an alternative to construct building until 10 levels.", "Daftar File": {"2007 TA PP RINA YUANDHA DEWI dan  ARIANE VIKY SUDRAJAT 1-COVER.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/12279", "2007 TA PP RINA YUANDHA DEWI dan ARIANE VIKY SUDRAJAT 1-BAB 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/12280", "2007 TA PP RINA YUANDHA DEWI dan ARIANE VIKY SUDRAJAT 1-BAB 2.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/12281", "2007 TA PP RINA YUANDHA DEWI dan ARIANE VIKY SUDRAJAT 1-BAB 3.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/12282", "2007 TA PP RINA YUANDHA DEWI dan ARIANE VIKY SUDRAJAT 1-BAB 4.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/12283", "2007 TA PP RINA YUANDHA DEWI dan ARIANE VIKY SUDRAJAT 1-BAB 5.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/12284", "2007 TA PP RINA YUANDHA DEWI dan ARIANE VIKY SUDRAJAT 1-BAB 6.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/12285", "2007 TA PP RINA YUANDHA DEWI dan  ARIANE VIKY SUDRAJAT 1-PUSTAKA.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/12286"}, "Penulis": "Rina Yuandha Dewi (NIM:150 03 015)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing:  R Bambang Budiono,Ir., ME., DR., Prof.", ""], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Static push-over analysis; beam-column and flat slab system; UBC 1997; IBC 2003; ATC-40, reinforced concrete moment resisting frames; capacity curve; demand curve; displacement; performance level; ductility.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice D \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "8 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
