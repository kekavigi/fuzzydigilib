Aggregate minerals are the most important construction materials in which their role can not be changed for long years for infrastructure development. Indonesia has huge potencies of aggregate minerals, but it does not guarantee the supply for construction materials. In other hand, the Netherlands with limited aggregate minerals resources tries hard to ensure the sustainability of aggregate minerals supply. This research explores the sustainability concept of aggregate minerals supply and intends to recognize its implementation both in the Netherlands and Indonesia. Moreover, the research attempts to find out what is positive lessons can be learned from the Dutch experiences to Indonesia for a better aggregate mineral resources management. This research is conducted by using literature followed with comparison analysis between two countries that focus mainly on mineral planning policy, task and government authority. The typology of sustainability of Turner and Pierce is used to identify the degree of the implementation of sustainability on aggregate mineral supply in both countries. Moreover, the three main criteria of Shields and Solars on sustainable development principles relevant to mining and mineral resources are used to assess the implementation of the sustainability aggregate minerals supply, those are, basic sustainable development principles, environmental sustainable development principles and socio-political sustainable development principles. The result of this research concludes that the Netherlands is more advance in implementing the sustainability concept of aggregate minerals supply than Indonesia. Furthermore, this research identify some lesson learned from the Dutch country that can be adopted in Indonesia, namely, public involvement in managing aggregate mineral resources, promoting the sustainable use of aggregate minerals and combining aggregate mineral extraction with other function.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Eri Hatinlahiry (NIM 25405019-RuG: S1623338)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Supervisor I: Paul Ike, Dr., Ir.
