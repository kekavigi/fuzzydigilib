{"Nomor": 2589, "Judul": "A GLOBAL KAM-THEOREM MONODROMY IN NEAR-INTEGRABLE PERTURBATION OF THE SPHERICAL PENDULUM", "Abstrak": "The KAM Theory for the persistence of Lagrangean invariant tori in nearly integrable Hamiltonian systems is globalized to bundles of invariant tori. This leads to globally well-defined conjugations between near-integrable systems and their integrable approximations, defined on nowhere dense sets of positive measure associated to Diophantine frequency vectors. These conjugations are Whitney smooth diffeomorphisms between the corresponding torus bundles. Thus the geometry of the integrable torus bundle is inherited by the near-integrable perturbation. This is of interest in cases where these bundles are nontrivial. The paper deals with the spherical pendulum as a leading example.", "Daftar File": {"Proc.On-kink-dynamics-of-stacked...H.Susanto.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/2954"}, "Penulis": "Lembaga Penelitian dan Pengabdian Masyarakat (LPPM)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": [], "Jenis Koleksi": "Prosiding", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "THEOREM MONODROMY", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Mar 2005"}
