The concept concerns with the development of management organization in emergency condition that includes intelligent machines in functional aspects and based on (a) data fusion among sensor in the intelligent machine system, and (b) data fusion among intelligent machines. Hopefully that collaboration in the proposed configuration can present a more reliable or believable information. Then the concept is i mplemented in the collaboration between fault diagnosis module as main intelligent machine and an autonomous robot system as second intelligent machine. Both of intelligent machines employing the fault diagnosis program in DURESS system which represented as complex system. The main intelligent machine detects abnormalities in the plant, analyses, and sends the estimated information to the second intelligent machine. Then the second intelligent machine will be transmitted to instalation and make sure     \nthe abnormality occurred and to localize the faulty components. Dempster's rule of evidence from both of i ntelligent machines showed that the hierarchical collaboration increases the belief level.", "Daftar File": {"mjl-.-the-concept.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/950"}, "Penulis": "Djoko Hari Nugroho", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Scanner:Mudjiono"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Collaboration, complex system, fault diagnosis, hierarchical, intelligent machines", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "17 Jan 2006"}
