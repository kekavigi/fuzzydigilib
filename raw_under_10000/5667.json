These models consist of different philosophy, target, scheme (internal process) and result. From this sample we can conclude that all of these institutions have the same intention that is to help and develop their community in their own ways. The target and model used need to be aligning each other with the institutions goals.  \n \n \n\nThe success of microfinance programs is determined by the proper match among target, model, and institutions goals.
