{"Nomor": 9251, "Judul": "SISTEM PENDETEKSI WAJAH MANUSIA", "Abstrak": "Face detection is one of the most important preprocessing step in face recognition systems used in biometric identification. Face detection can also be used in \n\nsearching and indexing still image or video containing faces in various size, position, and background. \n\nThis paper describes a face detection system using multi ayer perceptron and Quickprop algorithm. The system achieves its ability by means of learning by examples. \n\nThe training is performed using active learning method to minimize the amount of data used in training. \n\nExperimental results show that the accuracy of the system strongly depends on the quality and quantity of the data used in training.", "Daftar File": {"naskah-pub-ugm-sn.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/29878"}, "Penulis": "Setyo Nugroho1, Agus Harjoko", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["#CONTRIBUTOR#"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Laporan Penelitian", "Penerbit": "Lain-lain", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": ": face detection, neural networks, Quickprop, active learning", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Mahmudin \u00a0\n                                     Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "28 Mei 2008"}
