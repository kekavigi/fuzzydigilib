This is largely caused by the high content of ricinoleic acid in its oil glycerides. Further processingof castoroil may produce 12-hydroxystearic acid, which is the most important source for lubricant additive industry. The conversion to its lithium salt, it become a multipurpose additive which increase the properties of grease containing it. The experiment will study the production processes of hydrogenated castor oil and its lithium salt, so that the detail technology can be defined to support development local renewable-base industry.", "Daftar File": {"2004_LP_PP_PRAKOSO_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/5423"}, "Penulis": "Tirto Prakoso", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Peran: Tirto Prakoso  Scan/upload: Dikdik Suhendi (2006-06-12)"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Laporan Penelitian", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Hydrogenation, Catalytic, Castor Oil", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Jun 2006"}
