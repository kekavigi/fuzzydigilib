{"Nomor": 779, "Judul": "ENERGY LEVELS OF BR81 POPULATED BY THE DECAY OF SE81M AND SE81", "Abstrak": "The gamma rays following the decay of Se8lm (57 min) and Se81 (18 min) have been investigated using a Li-Ge detector, a gamma-gamma coincidence apparatus and a high pressure gas proportional counter. Se 81m and Se81 were produced by neutron bombardment of 94.4% enriched Se80 and natural selenium. Nine gamma rays have been identified as belonging to the decay of Se8lm and Se81 by using the Li-Ge detector through comparison of spectra taken with enriched Se80 and natural selenium samples, respectively, half-life comparison measurements and direct half-life measurements. The energies (in keV) and relative intensities (in brackets) of these gamma rays are as follows. Se81m: 103.3 + 0.2 (100) and 1146 \u00c2\u00b1 2 (3.4 \u00c2\u00b1 0.6). Se81; 276.3 \u00c2\u00b1 0.4 (100), 290.2 + 0.4 (79.6 f 5. 6), 538.7 + 0.7(6.2 + 0. 7), 552.7 f 0.7 (12.8 + 1.4), 566.1 +0.7 (28.9 f 2. 6), 650.4 +0.9 (2.6 \u00c2\u00b1 0.4) and 829.2 +0.8 (36.6 f 2.6). In addition, one gamma ray of energy (180 f 2) keV (relative intensity = 0.94 f 0.19) has also been attributed to Se81 through gamma-gamma coincidence measurements. On the basis of these results an energy level scheme of Br81 populated by the decay of Se8lm and Se81 has been proposed by introducing levels at 276, 566, 650, 815, 829 and 1146 keV. The 1146 keV level is populated by a direct beta decay of Se8lm having a transition intensity of (0.34 f 0.13)%. The beta-decay transition intensities of Se81 to the ground state and to the 566, 650, 815 and 829 keV levels of Br81 have been computed to be (98.8 f 0.33)%, (0.76 + 0.21)%, (0.014 \u00c2\u00b1 00 006)%, (0. 042 f 0.013)% and (0.36 f 0.10)%, respectively.", "Daftar File": {"1966_TS_PP_PRAWIRO_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/1043"}, "Penulis": "Soedijono Prawirosoehardjo", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": [], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "a Li-Ge detector, the gamma rays, neutron, natural selenium.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "20 Nov 2004"}
