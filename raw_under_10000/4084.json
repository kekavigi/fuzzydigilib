The mutual shaping between technology and community implies that technology governance has to take into account of technology diffusion and innovation whose process is co-evolutionary in nature. In this paper, a methodological framework which is designed to understand technology governance is based on actor-network theory. A case study about the implementation of technology scanner to process a census of population data is presented to ilustrate the application of the above-mentioned methodological framework. The problems found during the research are also presented at the last part of this paper.", "Daftar File": {"2006 YULIAR": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/4994"}, "Penulis": "S.Yuliar", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Scan :  Like (2006-05-04)"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Jurnal elektronik", "Penerbit": "Ilmu Seni Rupa dan Desain", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Seni Rupa dan Desain", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "governance teknologi, mutual shaping teknologi dan masyarakat, proses ko-evolusioner, teori jejaring-aktor.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "04 Mei 2006"}
