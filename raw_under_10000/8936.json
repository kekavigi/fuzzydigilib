{"Nomor": 8936, "Judul": "SPATIAL MODELING OF SEDIMENT TRANSPORT OVER THE UPPER CITARUM CATCHMENT", "Abstrak": "This paper discusses set up of a spatial model applied in Geographic Information System (GIS) environment for predicting annual erosion rate and sediment yield of a watershed. The study area is situated in the Upper Citarum Catchment of West Java. Annual sediment yield is considered as product of erosion rate and sediment delivery ratio to be modelled under similar modeling tool. Sediment delivery ratio is estimated on the basis of sediment resident time. The modeling concept is based on the calculation of water flow velocity through subcatchment surface, which is controlled by topography, rainfall, soil characteristics and various types of land use. Relating velocity to known distance across digital elevation model, sediment resident time can be estimated. Data from relevance authorities are used. Bearing in mind limited knowledge of some governing factors due to lack of observation, the result has shown the potential of GIS for spatially modeling regional sediment transport. Validation of model result is carried out by evaluating measured and computed total sediment yield at the main outlet. Computed total sediment yields for 1994 and 2001 are found to be 1.96106 and 2.10106tons/year. They deviate roughly 54 and 8% with respect to those measured in the field. Model response due to land use change observed in 2001 and 1994 is also recognised. Under presumably constant rainfall depth, an increase of overall average annual erosion rate of 11% resulted in an increase of overall average sediment yield of 7%.", "Daftar File": {"Proceedings ITB Science and Technology  Vol 38 B No 1 2006  p 11-28.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/27681"}, "Penulis": "Poerbandono, Ahmad Basyar & Agung B.
