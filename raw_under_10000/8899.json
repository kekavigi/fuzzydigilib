{"Nomor": 8899, "Judul": "PRELIMINARY DESIGN OF 7 TON/H CONTINUOUS MULTISTAGE FLUIDIZED BED DRYING SYSTEM COAL UPGRADING PILOT PLANT", "Abstrak": "Abstract : \n \n\nDesign of 7 ton/It capacity multistage superheated steam coal upgrading system has been performed. The system, namely CUT (Coal Upgrading Technology) is consisted of three beds with different operating conditions. The first bed has the operating conditions of 70 C, 1.5 bar and using preheated air as fluidizing gas. The second and third bed are using superheated steam extracted from moisture content of coal itself, designed to operate at temperature of 140 C and 220 C, and pressure of 1.5 bar and 4.76 bar, respectively. The raw coal having 30% moisture (dry basis) is also designed to achieve the 5% moisture as upgraded coal product. \n \n\nThe operating conditions and dimensions were derived from computer simulation using Cycle-Tempo(R) and Matlab(R) programs. The Cycle-Tempo program was used to simulate thermodynamic energy and mass balance of plant, while Matlab was used to simulate fluidization characteristics. The result of fluidizing gas mass flow rate from Matlab program was used as iteration input for Cycle-Tempo and the temperature and pressure conditions from Cycle-Tempo was inputted to Matlab program; the iterative process was repeated to reach convergence. It has been observed that the optimum configuration using superheated drying steam from the boiler at 390 C and 29.79 bar resulted in the ratio of drying steam to evaporated moisture to be 0.66 or 2.3 MJ/kg removed water, comparatively feasible compared to 3.3 to 4.2 1W/kg for currently available drying process. \n \n\nThe simulation results - completed with several considerations of operation and maintenance parameters - were then presented in Process Flow Diagram, Process and Instrumentation Diagram and System Note. The plant layout diagram was also sketched to make land occupying estimation. The overall results were then packaged as a Preliminary Design. \n \n\nSimple financial analysis has also been performed to check the feasibility of the pilot plant project, and the results of 32.29% IRR and 6 year payback period are showing that the project is prospective.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Pandji Prawisudha (NIM 231 03 019)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Supervisor : Aryadi Suwono, Prof. Dr. \n \n\nCo-Supervisor : Toto Hardianto, Dr. Ir. \n \n\nScanner : Novian Kurniawan"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Mesin", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Mesin dan Dirgantara", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "coal drying, continuous multistage fluidized bed, preliminary design", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Ena Sukmana", "File": "8 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
