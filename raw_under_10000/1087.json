{"Nomor": 1087, "Judul": "ELECTRIC POWER IN INDONESIA: GROWTH, PROBLEMS, AND POSSIBILITIES FOR PRIVATE GENERATION", "Abstrak": "Growth of the electric power sector in Indonesia over the past two decades have been impressive: production of electric energy increased from a modest 3.03 TWh in 1969 to a respectable 51.97 TWh in 1988, reflecting a healthy average annual growth rate of 16.1 percent. Slightly less than half of above electricity is produced by PLN, the State-owned Indonesian Electric Power Company, the remainder generated by non-PLN producers, mostly self-generators. As oil is an important earner of much-needed foreign exchange currency, the diversification program of the national energy policy among others calls for the electric power sector to utilize non-oil fuels for its power generation. This study attempts to examine the effectiveness of the implementation of the diversification program in the electric power sector. by PLN as well as by non-PLN generation. PLN is essentially operating in a supply-constrained environment, caused by the unique geography and demography of the country. and also caused by financial constraints. The uti1ity is there fore lagging in demand, and this lag seems to be accelerating. In the second half of 1990, problems started to arise, as many new industries requesting connection to the PLN network had to be turned down. This study also endeavors to look into this problem, suggesting that private electric power may be the answer, also in order to comply with energy di versification objectives.", "Daftar File": {"1991_TS_PP_Kadir_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/1379"}, "Penulis": "Abdul Kadir", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["pembimbing : - Scanner : kory"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Disertasi", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "the remainder generated by non-PLN producers, mostly self-generators.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "30 Nov 2004"}
