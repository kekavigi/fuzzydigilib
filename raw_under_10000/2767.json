{"Nomor": 2767, "Judul": "TRAFFIC CONFLICT STUDIES AT SOME BANDUNG INTERSECTIONS", "Abstrak": "Many definitions of traffic conflicts have been developed. In this research the definition used was as follows:\" a traffic conflict is an observable situation in which two or more road users approach each other in space and time to such an extent that there is a risk of collision if their movements remain unchanged\" (GLAUZ and MIGLETZ, 1980). The application of brakes by at least one of the two road users to avoid a collision was used as evidence that a conflict had taken place. Evaluation of the reliability (whether different observers produce similar results) and the repeatability (whether one observer applied the method consistently) of the traffic conflict method were the main objectives in this research. To analyse the reliability of the method, four observers independently observed the same conflict events at the same location. The analysis shows that, in general, the method was reliable both comparatively and absolutely. It also indicates that for all types of total conflicts at all sites and for almost all types of conflict by site, the method was found reliable in the comparative sense. The repeatability of the method was tested by using the same video record which was reviewed twice by the same observer in the laboratory with a one week interval. The analysis of data from each of four observers indicates that the method was repeatable. It also found, although in general the method was repeatable there is some variation of repeatability between the four observers. It is concluded that this method is, in general, suitable for use in ranking locations according to conflicts and that it might be a consistent way of ranking problem intersections. The analysis of the relationships between traffic conflicts and flow, and between traffic conflicts and accidents, were inconclusive.", "Daftar File": {"1990_TS_PP_LEGOWO_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/3142"}, "Penulis": "HADI SRITJAHJO LEGOWO S.", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Supervisor: Nicholas W.Manler", "Supervisor: Willy Tumewu"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Sistem dan Teknik Jalan Raya", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Sipil dan Lingkungan", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Traffic conflicts, a risk of collision, traffic conflicts and accidents.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "19 Feb 2005"}
