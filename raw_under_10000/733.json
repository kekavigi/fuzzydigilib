PCA method has been applied to Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) \nsatellite data with good results. However, Landsat data have low temporal resolution (16 days) compared with \ndaily NOAA-AVHRR (NOAA-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) satellite data. So, NOAH-AVHRR data \nare able to provide better information on daily soil moisture. The objective of the study is to develop soil moisture \nestimation model based on daily 5-channel daily NOAH-AVHRR data using PCA method. The locations are West \nJava and Central Java as case study, while the period is August-September 1999. Some field soil samples were also \ntaken from the two locations. The coefficient of variance shows that the three principle component (PC) can explain \nthe variance of soil moisture of 0-20 cm depth better than of >20 cm depth. This is due to more dynamic surface \nsoil moisture change rather than deeper soil layer. Among the three PCs, the first PC is the best parameter- to \nestimate soil moisture. The index resulted by the first PC can estimate soil moisture better than vegetation index.", "Daftar File": {"Erna Sri Adiningsih": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/995"}, "Penulis": "Erna Sri Adiningsih", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Mahmud, Iskandar Effendi"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Laporan Penelitian", "Penerbit": "UPT Perpustakaan", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "PCA, soil moisture, soil brightness index, greenness index, soil wetness index, multispectral satellite data.", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Agu 2004"}
