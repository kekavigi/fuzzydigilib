{"Nomor": 4404, "Judul": "FORCED-UNFOLDING OF CALMODULIN BY STEERED MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATION", "Abstrak": "ABSTRACT:  Calmodulin (CaM) has two unique conformations in the presence and absence of Cal- ions. Previous single molecule force spectroscopy was able to distinguish the force-extension profiles for the two CaM forms when a single molecule of each conformer was stretched from its end by using the atomic force microscope (AFM). In the present study, we modeled such forced-unfolding work on both CaM forms by steered molecular dynamics (SMD) approach in orderto interpretthe experimentally observed force-extension profiles and gain the atomic-level view of the underlying process, which is not accessible by the experiment. SMD simulations were performed, in the current work, with pulling speed of 1 A/ps on both CaM forms. Resulting F-E curve data exhibited characteristic profiles that similar to those obtained from the experiment and hence enabled us to elucidate the molecular events related to such profiles.", "Daftar File": {"2004_LP_PP_HERTADI_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/5421"}, "Penulis": "Rukman Hertadi", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Peran: Rukman Hertadi  Scan upload: Dikdik Suhendi (2004-06-12)"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Laporan Penelitian", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Forced-Unfolding;  Calmodulin; atomic force microscope (AFM); steered molecular dynamics (SMD)", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "12 Jun 2006"}
