Genes that encoded for CPSase from Escherichia coil K-12, Salmonella typhimurium LT2 and Salmonella typhi showed high homology. The purpose of this research is to investigate whether the high homology of genes followed by the same structure of CPSase. The strategy chosed was immunoprecipitation method that used CarA antibodies and antipeptide antibodies to C-terminal of CarA, and SDS PAGE analysis. Immunoprecipitation method using CarA antibodies result two bands for each bacteria, with mobility of 55 kDa and 45 kDa. lmmunoprecipitation using'antipeptide antibodies to C-terminal of CarA result many bands. Band of 45 kDa could be identified as CarA Band of 55 kDa could be identified as antibodies that eluded in the release of antigen. The other bands were the coprecipitant. Based on the results, it can be suggested that structure of CPSase in S. typhimurium LT2 and S. typhi resemble to CPSase in E. coil K-12.", "Daftar File": {"2001 WINNI ASTUTI": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/2650"}, "Penulis": "WINNI ASTUTI [20599063]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing: Achmad Syaifuddin Noer"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Kimia", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "ANTIBODI ANTI PROTEIN", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "25 Okt 2004"}
