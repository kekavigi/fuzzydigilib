{"Nomor": 9474, "Judul": "MANAGING THE RISK OF NATURAL DISASTERS IN COASTAL ZONE: LESSONS LEARNED FROM TSUNAMI DISASTER IN NANGGROE ACEH DARUSSALAM PROVINCE", "Abstrak": "ABSTRACT:    \n \n \n \n \n\nTsunami disaster that hit Aceh on December 26, 2004 was really destructive. Although, the epicenter of this disaster was located in the western coast of Aceh, the impact was experienced by other Indonesian neighboring countries. It did not only damage the property and community in Aceh coastal area but also in inland area. The tsunami affected area covers up to more than 3 km inland Banda Aceh.     \n \n \n \n \n\nNAD Province is located in earthquake prone area and most tsunamis in Aceh are generated by earthquakes. In the past, tsunamis happened in this area and there will be tsunami in the future. Because of this, tsunami risk management measures become essential elements to reduce the impact of the next tsunami disasters.    \n \n \n \n \n\nThis research elaborates some tsunami risk management measures from India, Thailand and Japan regarding how to mitigate the impact of tsunami in the future, and considers some possibilities to be implemented and appropriate with the condition of NAD Province coastal zone.    \n \n \n \n \n\nTsunami risk management measures proposed by this research are technical, spatial and community measures. Technical measures are the measures related to physical construction in tsunami prone area. Spatial measures deal with land use planning related to tsunami disaster. Community measures are how to inform community about tsunami with regard to minimizing the loss of life in the future. Some recommendations to implement those measures well are provided at the end part of this research.", "Daftar File": {}, "Penulis": "Tetty Meutia (NIM 25405043-RuG: S1671197)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Supervisor I: G.J.J.
