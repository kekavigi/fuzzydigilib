More advance analysis has been done to get the crack pattern and moment - curvature curve due to the acting load. Nonlinear finite element method have been used to realized the purpose. Smeared cracking model is a well known method to model the concrete after crack. This method uses perfect bond assumption for bond-slip phenomenon between steel and concrete. Nonlinear finite element procedure have been applied to see the behavior of beam after post peak  .", "Daftar File": {"1999 Rendy Thamrin": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/3368"}, "Penulis": "Rendy Thamrin [25096052]", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Pembimbing 1: Dicky Rezady Munaf  scan :caca"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tesis", "Penerbit": "Teknik Sipil", "Fakultas": "Fakultas Teknik Sipil dan Lingkungan", "Subjek": "Civil engineering", "Kata Kunci": "KEKUATAN LENTUR BALOK", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Alice Diniarti", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "02 Feb 2005"}
