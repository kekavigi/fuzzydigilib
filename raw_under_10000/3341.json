{"Nomor": 3341, "Judul": "GENERAL DISCUSSION OPEN SCIENCE MEETING, FEBRUARY 12, ITB, BANDUNG", "Abstrak": "Abstrak:  For Indonesia it is essential to built on a research infrastructure to become a player in the international scientific community. The national research development should be focussed on capacity building (increase of the number of S3 (PhD) \u00c2\u2013 students). However, good science cannot be practised without proper access to research facilities, which are lacking in Indonesia, or are not well developed or organised. Most important is access to academic sources (scientific literature). Apart from access to research facilities an absolute requirement for good science is the strengthening of a scientific culture or mentality. Strengthening of a scientific culture should be a duty of senior scientists and goes deeper than just supervising of S3/PhD-students. (Bilateral) research co-operation is a strong instrument in strengthening a scientific culture. Sending Indonesian students to the Netherlands helps, but more important to help establishing a scientific culture is to bring Dutch (senior) scientists over to work in Indonesia for a longer period of time (2 years).", "Daftar File": {"2006_Clip_PP_Gen_1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/3760"}, "Penulis": "Gen", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Scan/upload: Dikdik S (2006-03-22)"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Kliping Elektronik", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "General Discussion; Open Science meeting; Education; Culture; Science", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Irwan Sofiyan", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "22 Mar 2006"}
