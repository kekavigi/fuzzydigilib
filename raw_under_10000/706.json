In particular, for the aiming of system identification, the algorithm of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) was used, which is very appropriate for nonlinear system.    \nThe designed ANN's algorithm has been applied to identify the dynamics of a deaerator and steam turbin by using the real measurement data. Identification process was done by assuming the model of system both of SISO (Single Input-Single Output) and MISO (Multi Input-Single Output). The Nonlinear Auto-Regressive with Exogenous Input (NARX) was developed as model structure in the  implementation of this identification. The results showed that the designed ANN model perform well in identification of plant and it can be approximated with 3\"d order model. It is expected that the accurate model which obtained from this study can explore to design an appropriate controller in the future.     \nKeywords: System Identification, deaerator, turbin uap, ANN", "Daftar File": {"mjl-.-identifikasi-dinamika.opd.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/966"}, "Penulis": "Poppy D.
