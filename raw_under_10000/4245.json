Eigenvectors are used to separate net radiation of form patterns that varies from place to place. This paper describes the process by which a matrix of eigenvector was be derived from the sets of 12 mean-monthly net radiation for 12 stations in Indonesian regions. By eliminating exception to natural cycles or first three eigenvectors from 12 mean-monthly net radiation, so that, we get net radiation anomaly. Pontianak regions show that correlation between sunspot anomaly than net radiation anomaly separated to be two phase, those are 1948-1976 years and 1977-2003 years that they have value correlations -0.68 and 0.58 sequencely.> Abstract :", "Daftar File": {"2005 P.M.Siregar": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/5185"}, "Penulis": "P.M.Siregar", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["Penulis 2 :  H.L The  Penulis 3:  I.
