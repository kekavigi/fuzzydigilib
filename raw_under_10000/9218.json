{"Nomor": 9218, "Judul": "WELL DRILLABILITY-HORIZONTAL WELL TORQUE AND DRAG PREDICTION AND ITS APPLICATION FOR ERD WELLS", "Abstrak": "Torque and drag analysis is critical when well planning especially in Extended Reach Drilling (ERD) and Horizontal wells. One of the important part of predicting torque and drag is determining the correct friction factor. Friction factor combines all unknown factor that are un-measurable in the wellbore in drilling condition. Such as the uncertainty of the hole geometry (Dogleg Severity and Trajectory) , pipe stiffness, cutting beds, mud lubricity, pipe weight errors, Mechanical Equipment, and other interactions. This study will analyze the drillability of the horizontal wells due to impact of torque and drag. Using actual data from field X : well X6, X7 and X9 a number of well models is created using wellplan software, the torque and drag actual data from the model will be matched with the torque and drag data from the actual field data by modifying the friction factor. The model with the valid and matched torque and drag data will be used to study the effects certain scenarios to improve well drillability such as drillstring configuration, mechanical friction reducer device, fluid lubricant, the use of OBM and trajectory optimization (minimize dogleg severity). In the end this study will give a certain input how to improve the drillability of an ERD well.", "Daftar File": {"2008 TA PP SANGGI RAKSAGATI 1.pdf": "https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/download/29632"}, "Penulis": "SANGGI RAKSAGATI (NIM 12204002)", "Kontributor / Dosen Pembimbing": ["#CONTRIBUTOR#"], "Jenis Koleksi": "Tugas Akhir", "Penerbit": "", "Fakultas": "", "Subjek": "", "Kata Kunci": "Torque, Drag, Friction Factor", "Sumber": "", "Staf Input/Edit": "Vika Anastasya Kovariansi \u00a0\n                                     Ena Sukmana", "File": "1 file", "Tanggal Input": "27 Sep 2017"}
